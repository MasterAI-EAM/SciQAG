Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets . It is growing in incidence and currently affects roughly 0.5% of the population in developed countries . Despite the vast understanding of its epidemiology, a definite solution for the prevention of type 1 diabetes or its deleterious effects is still not forthcoming. Causes of diabetes are believed to be associated with genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, or a combination of these. Many experimental studies have used simulated diabetes on animal models to understand the molecular events associated with this disease and its complications . Streptozotocin (STZ) 1 is well known to induce diabetogenic action by the selective destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and it is the most frequently used model for inducing diabetes mellitus . The STZ-induced diabetic rat model provides a good platform to investigate diabetes using new approaches that may provide additional information on and insight into the mechanisms and effects of the disease.\nThe rapidly growing field of metabolomics (or metabonomics) that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations provides a wealth of biological information on complex systems . It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer , type 2 diabetes , and inborn errors of metabolism , and it has been used to study the effects of diet , drugs , toxins , and stress . Metabolomics combines data-rich advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis (MSA). NMR-based metabolomics is capable of simultaneously detecting a wide variety of extracellular (and intracellular in the case of tissue) metabolites that provide information on a large number of normal and abnormal biochemical pathways. To date, NMR spectroscopy has been applied to a number of diabetes studies . NMR spectroscopy provides very high quantitative accuracy and reproducibility; is nondestructive, cost-effective, and rapid (typical requirements are a few minutes/sample); and requires limited or no sample preparation .\nNMR data in combination with MSA allow the identification of potential biomarkers in biological specimens and an improved ability to identify specific metabolic pathways and networks associated with disease . Widely used MSA methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analysis are applied for disease classification (through the use of scores plots) and biomarker detection (through the use of loadings plots) . The computation of the correlation among the detected metabolites can be used to study biological networks in metabolomics ; however, such approaches remain at a preliminary stage. In principle, the application of the correlation matrix is straightforward and holds a great deal of promise for tracing specific metabolic pathways to investigate metabolic disturbances due to disease or other effects.\nThis study aimed to identify disturbed metabolic pathways in STZ-induced diabetes using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. Absolute changes in the daily excreted quantities of detected metabolites (diabetic vs. control) and changes in the correlations among detected metabolites (for diabetic and control separately) were investigated. An integrated evaluation of metabolic changes in both quantities and correlations allowed us to trace specific disturbances in the metabolic pathways most associated with induced type 1 diabetes. We also compared our findings with current hypotheses regarding the detailed diabetes biochemistry.\n3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic acid\u2013d4 sodium salt (TSP), \u03b1-tocopherol (all-rac), STZ, 2-thiobarbituric, d-(+)-glucose, ethanol, sodium pyruvate, sodium fumarate dibasic, allantoin, and sodium azide were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were used without further purification.\nFemale rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley strain from the animal quarters located at San Pablo\u2013CEU University), all similar in development stage (12 \u00b1 2 weeks), were studied. The diabetic group (n = 8) consisted of animals that received an intraperitoneal dose (50 mg/kg) of STZ and showed glucose levels in the blood of more than 200 mg/dl after 4 days. The control group (n = 10) consisted of age- and gender-matched rats. Throughout the study, both diabetic and control animals were kept under appropriate conditions (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C temperature and 55 \u00b1 10% relative humidity). Air was replaced with adequate frequency, and the rats were maintained under a 12-h light\u2013darkness cycle. Animals were housed in collective cages (1820 cm3, not more than 6 animals per cage) with a bed of poplar shaving (29/12, Souralit, Spain), and all had free access to tap water and food (Harlan Global Diet 2014, Harlan Interfauna Ib\u00e9rica, Madrid, Spain). Seven days after STZ administration, the rats were housed in metabolic cages and urine was collected and pooled every 8 h. Urine collection tubes contained hydrogen chloride (0.1 M) to avoid bacterial contamination. The total volume of urine for each rat excreted in 24 h was measured and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Urine samples were transported to Purdue University by air carrier over dry ice for metabolomics studies. On the day of sacrifice, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (75\u2013100 mg/kg)/azepromacine (2.5 mg/ml) and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the San Pablo\u2013CEU University (RD 223/1988) and is in agreement with Amsterdam Treaty and Spanish legislation.\nPlasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and urea were analyzed using commercial kits from Spinreact (Gerona, Spain). Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were measured according to Viana and coworkers .\nFrozen urine samples were thawed, and 500 \u03bcl was mixed with phosphate buffer (75 \u03bcl, 0.5 M, pH 7.0), D2O (75 \u03bcl), TSP (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 0.11 \u03bcmol), and sodium azide (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 12.3 nmol). Resulting solutions were centrifuged to remove particulate matter, if any, and 500 \u03bcl of the supernatants was transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. All 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker DRX 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with an HCN 1H inverse detection probe with triple axis magnetic field gradients. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using the standard one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence with water presaturation during the recycle delay of 3 s and a mixing time of 100 ms. Each dataset was averaged over 32 transients using 32,000 time domain points. The data were Fourier transformed after multiplying by an exponential window function with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz, and the spectra were phase and baseline corrected using Bruker XWinNMR software (version 3.5).\nA total of 17 metabolites were identified in the 1H NMR spectra based on their characteristic chemical shifts and multiplicities. Individual metabolite quantities were then calculated by spectral integration of the full resolution data, taking into account the NMR signal intensity and number of protons that contributed to the measured NMR signals for both metabolites and the reference, TSP, and corrected using the total volume of urine excreted in 24 h.\nEach NMR data set was binned to 4096 points (bin size 0.003 ppm) to minimize the effects of pH and ionic concentration differences. The data were aligned with reference to the TSP signal, and the regions containing TSP, urea, and residual water (4.6\u20135.3 ppm) signals were removed. Each NMR data set was then appropriately multiplied using the total 24-h urine volume. The data were mean-centered and divided by the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) to emphasize both large- and small-concentration metabolite signals. Subsequently, the data were subjected to unsupervised statistical analysis, PCA, using Pirouette software (version 3.11, Infometrix) to classify the samples (control or diabetic). P values for the individual metabolites were determined on the actual metabolite quantities using the unpaired t test available in the R software package (http://www.r-project.org). A Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction was applied to adjust the P values by accounting for the 17 metabolites used in the analysis. In addition, the Pearson\u2019s correlations among all of the metabolites (for diabetic and control samples separately) were also calculated using R. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficients was tested using a t test by giving a null hypothesis (H0) of r = 0, where r represents the correlation coefficient. If H0 holds, t=rn-21-r2 approximately follows the t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to n\u20132, where n represents the sample size. A low P value (<0.05) for this test means that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or that there is a statistically significant relationship between the two variables (metabolites). Correspondingly, an absolute value of r larger than 0.6 (calculated for the control group) or 0.7 (calculated for the diabetic group) is considered as a statistically significant relationship between the two metabolites.\nSelected demographic and blood parameters determined by biochemical analysis of diabetic and control rat samples are shown in Table 1 . Mean values for plasma glucose, urea, \u03b1-tocopherol, TBARS, triglycerides, and liver \u03b1-tocopherol were higher in diabetes than control, whereas those for plasma protein and cholesterol were slightly lower. Diabetic rats consumed more water and excreted more than 10 times more urine (mean volume 129 \u00b1 39 ml) than control rats (mean volume 9.6 \u00b1 4.0 ml) in 24 h.\nTypical 1H NMR spectra of urine from a diabetic rat and a control rat are shown in Fig. 1 along with the metabolite assignments. Diabetic rat urine spectra contained very high-intensity signals arising from glucose. In addition, the spectra contained numerous signals from the following small molecules: alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, fumarate, succinate, citrate, formate, hippurate, urea, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine. The assignments were made based on literature values , and tentative assignments made due to the overlap or slight shift in their positions (such as for glucose, ethanol, pyruvate, fumarate, and allantoin) were confirmed by rerecording 1H NMR spectra for urine before and after the addition of small quantities of the respective standard compounds obtained from commercial sources.\nTable 2 shows the metabolite mean quantities and standard deviations in both diabetic and control groups as well as P values between the two groups. Glucose excretion was enormous in diabetic rats, with the quantity being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats (P = 0.000099). The metabolite with the second highest increase was lactate, with the amount being nearly 40-fold higher in diabetes (P = 0.045). Other significantly enhanced metabolites were alanine, ethanol, acetate, and fumarate (P < 0.05). The average quantities of pyruvate, formate, succinate, and dimethylglycine were 2- to 4-fold higher in diabetes than in controls but were not statistically significant. 2-Oxoglutarate, citrate, hippurate, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine did not show any large or significant differences (Ps = 0.089\u20130.97).\nThe PCA scores plot for the quantitative NMR data shows well-separated clusters for disease and control rats (Fig. 2 A) and a tight grouping of the control animals. The PC1 loadings plot (Fig. 2B) shows a large number of metabolites in addition to glucose that contributed to the separation. Supervised PLS discriminant analysis also was applied to the data after Pareto scaling and showed similar scores and loadings plots to those for PCA (Fig. S1 in Supplementary material). Although glucose signals dominate the loadings plot, other metabolites such as alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, succinate, formate, and allantoin show positive loadings (similar to glucose). Citrate, creatinine, and hippurate have negative loadings (opposite to glucose). Fumarate does not clearly show up in the PC1 loadings plot, possibly because it has a relatively small variance across all samples as well as a low concentration. The additional contribution of metabolites other than glucose was further demonstrated by performing PCA again (Fig. 2C and D) after removing the glucose region, and the scores plot still shows a clear separation between the diabetic and control rats.\nTo investigate relationships among the metabolites, their quantities were correlated separately for diabetic and control rats using Pearson\u2019s correlation (Fig. 3 ). Correlation coefficients range from 1.0 (maximum positive correlation) to \u22121.0 (maximum anticorrelation), with a value of 0 representing no correlation. It is clear from the comparison of the two correlation plots in Fig. 3 that the changes between the diabetic and control animals were minimal for the correlation of glucose with alanine, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, citrate, allantoin, and creatinine. In diabetic rats, the correlation of glucose with urea was increased dramatically from 0.3 to 1, whereas the correlation of glucose with lactate decreased from 0.6 to 0. The correlation of citrate with alanine, lactate, and succinate was decreased from 0.9 to 0.4, from 0.8 to \u22120.3, and from 0.8 to \u22120.5, respectively, whereas the correlation of citrate with pyruvate, fumarate, and urea increased. Several metabolites showed a high positive correlation with one another in both diabetes and controls. For example, the metabolite pairs of acetate and ethanol, 2-oxoglutarate and citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and creatinine, and allantoin and creatinine showed high correlation (R > 0.9). Overall, for control rats, most metabolites correlate with one another with high correlation coefficients, as indicated by the predominantly red and orange regions in Fig. 3A, except that acetate, ethanol, and formate are relatively isolated from other metabolites and show blue stripes (|R| < 0.4) in the correlation network. In contrast, the increased blue regions in Fig. 3B for the diabetic animals indicate that a number of correlations are significantly decreased and show an overall decrease in metabolic correlation.\nUpon STZ administration, plasma glucose showed elevated levels, with its quantity being nearly three times higher than in control rats, as anticipated. A number of other changes in blood parameters are also observed (Table 1). However, much more dramatic changes are seen in the urine, as indicated by the 1H NMR data. This is further shown using a quantitative metabolomics approach, in which a distinct classification of diabetic and normal rats is observed (Fig. 2A and B). Statistical analysis of the NMR data, even after removing the glucose signals, showed a number of metabolites contributing to the clear separation of diabetic animals from control animals (Fig. 2C and D). This is corroborated by the high metabolite mean ratios (>2) of 8 of the metabolites (Table 2). As described below, a detailed analysis of the metabolite correlation matrices (Fig. 3) in combination with their altered metabolite levels indicates a significantly altered metabolism in the glucose metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles and the effect of gut microbial metabolism in rat diabetes. Fig. 4 compiles these observations based on the KEGG metabolic pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Each metabolite is designated using a specific shape and is filled with a specific color to indicate correlations and altered quantities, respectively. Four types of shapes are used to indicate diverse correlations among the observed 17 metabolites, whereas the five different colors are used to indicate the changes in quantities of these metabolites. Three colored borders are used to differentiate the correlations with three key metabolites: glucose (blue), acetate (purple), and creatinine (pink). Black and purple arrows are used to differentiate mammalian pathways from bacterial pathways. The origin and implications of these relationships are discussed below in terms of the altered glucose metabolism, the TCA cycle, and symbiotic metabolism observed in this study.\nIncreased glucose in diabetes is due in large part to the enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP) from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis) and the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). It has been shown that glycogenolysis was the major factor causing EGP in early stage insulin deficiency . At a later stage, especially for type 1 diabetes, EGP is attributed mainly to gluconeogenesis fueled by amino acids from degraded protein or dietary ingestion. Although such findings are still somewhat in question due to the lack of reliability in the quantitative measurements , our studies support this hypothesis. In particular, significantly or moderately increased levels of alanine and urea with glucose in diabetes and their increased correlation with one another clearly suggest enhanced amino acids-fueled EGP in diabetes. The increased alanine concentration found in this study for the diabetic rats is in agreement with reports on human type 1 and type 2 diabetes . An observed increased correlation of glucose with alanine but not with lactate in diabetic rats suggests that the EGP might be associated more closely with amino acids than with lactate even though the EGP effect from lactate is normally double that arising from alanine . The observations of severely enhanced lactate in both diabetic urine (Table 2) and plasma indicate a significantly reduced consumption of lactate compared with its production. The association of EGP with protein/amino acid metabolism in diabetes was also evident from the observed urea changes. The increased urea average content in both plasma and urine (Tables 1 and 2) in the diabetic animals suggests an increasing nitrogen load to the liver where urea is formed. We observed remarkable changes in the relationship between urea and glucose; there is essentially no correlation between these two metabolites (R = 0.3) in the control animals, whereas a strikingly high correlation between glucose and urea (R = 1.0) develops in diabetes (Fig. 3). The correlation agrees with a known fact that the amino-acid-fueled EGP enhances the nitrogen load on the liver and, consequently, urea synthesis is closely related to glucose synthesis . Because we observed minimal loss of body mass, the high correlation between urea and glucose in diabetic samples more likely indicates that high glucose is fueled mainly by ingested amino acids along with likely reduced protein synthesis.\nA glucose homeostasis was observed in control rats from the positive correlation of glucose with both the gluconeogenesis precursors alanine, lactate, and pyruvate and the TCA cycle intermediates 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, succinate, and citrate. This can be explained by the fact that a good control of glucose catabolism and anabolism is highly associated with the glucose\u2013alanine and Cori (glucose\u2013lactate) cycles between peripheral tissues and the liver, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Both lactate and alanine are formed peripherally by glucose-derived pyruvate and are transported to the liver, where their carbon skeleton is reconverted to glucose. The maintenance of glucose homeostasis also demands a well-functioned TCA cycle capable of producing gluconeogenesis precursors and facilitating glucose oxidation. In addition to the observation that glucose correlates with the identified TCA cycle, it was found from our study that pyruvate (the glycolytic end product that enters the TCA cycle) correlates with the three detected TCA cycle intermediates: 2-oxoglurarate, fumarate, and citrate (Figs. 3A and 4). The metabolic profile from STZ-induced diabetes shows a dramatic perturbation of both glucose metabolism and the TCA cycle, as indicated in both Figs. 3B and 4. First, although glucose correlates highly with alanine, it fails to correlate with lactate (Fig. 3B), indicating that the Cori cycle might be perturbed. Second, the correlation of glucose with the TCA intermediates is markedly disturbed with decreasing or missing correlations with 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, and succinate. Third, the correlations among the TCA intermediates are also significantly altered; for example, succinate no longer correlates with 2-oxoglutarate and citrate in diabetic rats.\nAn accumulation of acetate in STZ-induced diabetic urine suggests a defective acetate switch, that is, the molecular switch that regulates the dissimilation and assimilation of acetate . The elevation of acetate indicates an increased acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (CoA) pool due to both exogenous (bacterial fermentation) and endogenous (mammalian) production . Mammalian up-regulation of acetyl\u2013CoA synthetase 2 (AceCS2) leads to an accumulation of acetate under ketogenic conditions . AceCS2 occurs in most organs but not in the liver, and its up-regulation in other organs stimulates liver excretion of acetate, which accumulates in the bloodstream . In addition, the reduced expression of mammalian AceCS1 (which converts acetate to acetyl\u2013CoA) might also contribute partially to acetate accumulation .\nThe observed correlations of acetate with ethanol, lactate, succinate, and formate suggest that the origin of these metabolites may be more microbial than mammalian. It is well known that gut bacteria produce these metabolites, and this evidence was also confirmed by an NMR study of gut fluid (jejunal aspirate) . Another in vitro 1H NMR spectroscopy study on bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae showed that the bacteria produced acetate, succinate, and ethanol in the presence of a carbon source such as glycerol . Furthermore, the quantity of these bacterial metabolites increased significantly with increasing bacterial count, establishing their link with the bacteria . The high correlation of acetate with succinate in diabetes (R = 1) versus their moderate correlation in controls (R = 0.6) is in agreement with the intestinal microbial overgrowth in STZ-induced rats . A strong association between acetate and ethanol was observed in both control and STZ rats. Detection of acetate and ethanol in the rat digestive tract was reported previously , and their enhancements in diabetes are consistent with our results. Alternatively, excess glucose can augment the carbon flux to the TCA cycle, inhibiting the expression of many TCA cycle enzymes and producing a number of partially oxidized metabolites (e.g., ethanol, lactate, formate, succinate). This situation is known as the bacterial Crabtree effect . In the current study, an explanation for the increased amounts of these bacterial metabolites in diabetic rat urine may be due to (i) an increase in bacterial metabolites produced in the gut of diabetic rats due to the microbial overgrowth, (ii) the Crabtree effect, or (iii) both effects (i) and (ii). Significant levels of bacterial metabolites observed in diabetic rats and their possible origin, gut microbes, could have significant implications for understanding and controlling the secondary effects of these acids on diabetic patients. However, a further investigation is needed to verify this microbial hypothesis.\nCholine is degraded via (i) mammalian pathways in which choline is converted to creatinine via dimethylglycine and (ii) symxenobiotic pathways in which choline is converted to methylamine by gut microbiota . A remarkable switch between dimethylglycine and dimethylamine was observed from our study. In controls, dimethylamine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylglycine fails to correlate with these metabolites. In diabetes, on the contrary, dimethyglycine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylamine fails to correlate with these metabolites. The reasons causing such a correlative switch are still unclear at this stage. The significant enhancement of dimethylglycine observed in STZ\u2013diabetic rats may suggest an increased mammalian uptake of dietary choline. Alternatively, an enhanced conversion of choline to dimethylglycine may occur as compared with its conversions to dimethylamine (no observed difference between control and diabetes) or phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4). The altered choline metabolism could be accounted for by the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver weight in diabetic rats, as observed from our study (Table 1). High blood glucose levels in the presence of even low insulin levels stimulate the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis . Insufficient conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine exacerbates fatty liver and results in accumulation of triglycerides in plasma . It is possible that the conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine was reduced due to its potentially enhanced conversion to dimethyglycine in diabetic rats. More studies are required to understand in detail the specific reasons for such a switch in the correlations among the metabolites of the choline pathway.\nElevation of lactate and pyruvate from the STZ\u2013diabetic rats indicates an increased glycolysis. Because muscle cells in these STZ rats will be glucose starved and would likely oxidize all of the carbon from glucose through oxidative phosphorylation, the high levels of pyruvate and lactate might instead stem from glycolic production of lactate at the level of the red blood cells (RBCs) , which express a variant of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. It is also possible that other non-insulin-sensitive tissues are metabolizing glucose to lactate, which can be interconverted to pyruvate. This pathway may provide a good compensatory mechanism given that the monocarboxylase transporters, which carry lactate into and out of muscle cells, are not insulin sensitive. Thus, lactate would enter the cell and be converted to pyruvate. However, this scenario does not rule out the possibility of a gut microbial production contribution to the enhanced lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Further investigations need to be carried out to discern the origin of accumulated lactate and pyruvate.\nThe TBARS concentration in plasma has been used as an oxidative stress biomarker associated with the presence and amount of final fat degradation products induced by free radicals, and it has been shown to be increased in diabetes and to decrease after treatment with antioxidants . This parameter has been highly criticized because of its lack of specificity , and although it should not be used alone to reach conclusions, it may add information if used in combination with other oxidative stress biomarkers.\nIn conclusion, this NMR-based metabolomics approach is useful for the identification and quantitation of high-concentration but important metabolites, and it provides significant information for improving the understanding of disease through the identification of altered metabolic pathways and networks. The urinary metabolites show dramatic changes in this rat diabetic model when compared with blood-based assays. Correlations among the detected metabolites show a number of striking differences between the diabetic and control rats. Metabolomics-based approaches that identify altered mammalian and symbiotic pathways observed in induced diabetes in rats will be useful for providing additional detailed knowledge concerning metabolic pathways associated with diabetes. Application of these methods to human diabetic patients and a comparison with the derived metabolite and pathway correlations may provide information for identifying additional factors associated with molecular genesis of diabetes and oxidative stress.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets . It is growing in incidence and currently affects roughly 0.5% of the population in developed countries . Despite the vast understanding of its epidemiology, a definite solution for the prevention of type 1 diabetes or its deleterious effects is still not forthcoming. Causes of diabetes are believed to be associated with genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, or a combination of these. Many experimental studies have used simulated diabetes on animal models to understand the molecular events associated with this disease and its complications . Streptozotocin (STZ) 1 is well known to induce diabetogenic action by the selective destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and it is the most frequently used model for inducing diabetes mellitus . The STZ-induced diabetic rat model provides a good platform to investigate diabetes using new approaches that may provide additional information on and insight into the mechanisms and effects of the disease.\nThe rapidly growing field of metabolomics (or metabonomics) that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations provides a wealth of biological information on complex systems . It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer , type 2 diabetes , and inborn errors of metabolism , and it has been used to study the effects of diet , drugs , toxins , and stress . Metabolomics combines data-rich advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis (MSA). NMR-based metabolomics is capable of simultaneously detecting a wide variety of extracellular (and intracellular in the case of tissue) metabolites that provide information on a large number of normal and abnormal biochemical pathways. To date, NMR spectroscopy has been applied to a number of diabetes studies . NMR spectroscopy provides very high quantitative accuracy and reproducibility; is nondestructive, cost-effective, and rapid (typical requirements are a few minutes/sample); and requires limited or no sample preparation .\nNMR data in combination with MSA allow the identification of potential biomarkers in biological specimens and an improved ability to identify specific metabolic pathways and networks associated with disease . Widely used MSA methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analysis are applied for disease classification (through the use of scores plots) and biomarker detection (through the use of loadings plots) . The computation of the correlation among the detected metabolites can be used to study biological networks in metabolomics ; however, such approaches remain at a preliminary stage. In principle, the application of the correlation matrix is straightforward and holds a great deal of promise for tracing specific metabolic pathways to investigate metabolic disturbances due to disease or other effects.\nThis study aimed to identify disturbed metabolic pathways in STZ-induced diabetes using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. Absolute changes in the daily excreted quantities of detected metabolites (diabetic vs. control) and changes in the correlations among detected metabolites (for diabetic and control separately) were investigated. An integrated evaluation of metabolic changes in both quantities and correlations allowed us to trace specific disturbances in the metabolic pathways most associated with induced type 1 diabetes. We also compared our findings with current hypotheses regarding the detailed diabetes biochemistry.\n3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic acid\u2013d4 sodium salt (TSP), \u03b1-tocopherol (all-rac), STZ, 2-thiobarbituric, d-(+)-glucose, ethanol, sodium pyruvate, sodium fumarate dibasic, allantoin, and sodium azide were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were used without further purification.\nFemale rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley strain from the animal quarters located at San Pablo\u2013CEU University), all similar in development stage (12 \u00b1 2 weeks), were studied. The diabetic group (n = 8) consisted of animals that received an intraperitoneal dose (50 mg/kg) of STZ and showed glucose levels in the blood of more than 200 mg/dl after 4 days. The control group (n = 10) consisted of age- and gender-matched rats. Throughout the study, both diabetic and control animals were kept under appropriate conditions (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C temperature and 55 \u00b1 10% relative humidity). Air was replaced with adequate frequency, and the rats were maintained under a 12-h light\u2013darkness cycle. Animals were housed in collective cages (1820 cm3, not more than 6 animals per cage) with a bed of poplar shaving (29/12, Souralit, Spain), and all had free access to tap water and food (Harlan Global Diet 2014, Harlan Interfauna Ib\u00e9rica, Madrid, Spain). Seven days after STZ administration, the rats were housed in metabolic cages and urine was collected and pooled every 8 h. Urine collection tubes contained hydrogen chloride (0.1 M) to avoid bacterial contamination. The total volume of urine for each rat excreted in 24 h was measured and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Urine samples were transported to Purdue University by air carrier over dry ice for metabolomics studies. On the day of sacrifice, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (75\u2013100 mg/kg)/azepromacine (2.5 mg/ml) and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the San Pablo\u2013CEU University (RD 223/1988) and is in agreement with Amsterdam Treaty and Spanish legislation.\nPlasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and urea were analyzed using commercial kits from Spinreact (Gerona, Spain). Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were measured according to Viana and coworkers .\nFrozen urine samples were thawed, and 500 \u03bcl was mixed with phosphate buffer (75 \u03bcl, 0.5 M, pH 7.0), D2O (75 \u03bcl), TSP (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 0.11 \u03bcmol), and sodium azide (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 12.3 nmol). Resulting solutions were centrifuged to remove particulate matter, if any, and 500 \u03bcl of the supernatants was transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. All 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker DRX 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with an HCN 1H inverse detection probe with triple axis magnetic field gradients. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using the standard one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence with water presaturation during the recycle delay of 3 s and a mixing time of 100 ms. Each dataset was averaged over 32 transients using 32,000 time domain points. The data were Fourier transformed after multiplying by an exponential window function with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz, and the spectra were phase and baseline corrected using Bruker XWinNMR software (version 3.5).\nA total of 17 metabolites were identified in the 1H NMR spectra based on their characteristic chemical shifts and multiplicities. Individual metabolite quantities were then calculated by spectral integration of the full resolution data, taking into account the NMR signal intensity and number of protons that contributed to the measured NMR signals for both metabolites and the reference, TSP, and corrected using the total volume of urine excreted in 24 h.\nEach NMR data set was binned to 4096 points (bin size 0.003 ppm) to minimize the effects of pH and ionic concentration differences. The data were aligned with reference to the TSP signal, and the regions containing TSP, urea, and residual water (4.6\u20135.3 ppm) signals were removed. Each NMR data set was then appropriately multiplied using the total 24-h urine volume. The data were mean-centered and divided by the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) to emphasize both large- and small-concentration metabolite signals. Subsequently, the data were subjected to unsupervised statistical analysis, PCA, using Pirouette software (version 3.11, Infometrix) to classify the samples (control or diabetic). P values for the individual metabolites were determined on the actual metabolite quantities using the unpaired t test available in the R software package (http://www.r-project.org). A Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction was applied to adjust the P values by accounting for the 17 metabolites used in the analysis. In addition, the Pearson\u2019s correlations among all of the metabolites (for diabetic and control samples separately) were also calculated using R. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficients was tested using a t test by giving a null hypothesis (H0) of r = 0, where r represents the correlation coefficient. If H0 holds, t=rn-21-r2 approximately follows the t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to n\u20132, where n represents the sample size. A low P value (<0.05) for this test means that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or that there is a statistically significant relationship between the two variables (metabolites). Correspondingly, an absolute value of r larger than 0.6 (calculated for the control group) or 0.7 (calculated for the diabetic group) is considered as a statistically significant relationship between the two metabolites.\nSelected demographic and blood parameters determined by biochemical analysis of diabetic and control rat samples are shown in Table 1 . Mean values for plasma glucose, urea, \u03b1-tocopherol, TBARS, triglycerides, and liver \u03b1-tocopherol were higher in diabetes than control, whereas those for plasma protein and cholesterol were slightly lower. Diabetic rats consumed more water and excreted more than 10 times more urine (mean volume 129 \u00b1 39 ml) than control rats (mean volume 9.6 \u00b1 4.0 ml) in 24 h.\nTypical 1H NMR spectra of urine from a diabetic rat and a control rat are shown in Fig. 1 along with the metabolite assignments. Diabetic rat urine spectra contained very high-intensity signals arising from glucose. In addition, the spectra contained numerous signals from the following small molecules: alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, fumarate, succinate, citrate, formate, hippurate, urea, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine. The assignments were made based on literature values , and tentative assignments made due to the overlap or slight shift in their positions (such as for glucose, ethanol, pyruvate, fumarate, and allantoin) were confirmed by rerecording 1H NMR spectra for urine before and after the addition of small quantities of the respective standard compounds obtained from commercial sources.\nTable 2 shows the metabolite mean quantities and standard deviations in both diabetic and control groups as well as P values between the two groups. Glucose excretion was enormous in diabetic rats, with the quantity being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats (P = 0.000099). The metabolite with the second highest increase was lactate, with the amount being nearly 40-fold higher in diabetes (P = 0.045). Other significantly enhanced metabolites were alanine, ethanol, acetate, and fumarate (P < 0.05). The average quantities of pyruvate, formate, succinate, and dimethylglycine were 2- to 4-fold higher in diabetes than in controls but were not statistically significant. 2-Oxoglutarate, citrate, hippurate, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine did not show any large or significant differences (Ps = 0.089\u20130.97).\nThe PCA scores plot for the quantitative NMR data shows well-separated clusters for disease and control rats (Fig. 2 A) and a tight grouping of the control animals. The PC1 loadings plot (Fig. 2B) shows a large number of metabolites in addition to glucose that contributed to the separation. Supervised PLS discriminant analysis also was applied to the data after Pareto scaling and showed similar scores and loadings plots to those for PCA (Fig. S1 in Supplementary material). Although glucose signals dominate the loadings plot, other metabolites such as alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, succinate, formate, and allantoin show positive loadings (similar to glucose). Citrate, creatinine, and hippurate have negative loadings (opposite to glucose). Fumarate does not clearly show up in the PC1 loadings plot, possibly because it has a relatively small variance across all samples as well as a low concentration. The additional contribution of metabolites other than glucose was further demonstrated by performing PCA again (Fig. 2C and D) after removing the glucose region, and the scores plot still shows a clear separation between the diabetic and control rats.\nTo investigate relationships among the metabolites, their quantities were correlated separately for diabetic and control rats using Pearson\u2019s correlation (Fig. 3 ). Correlation coefficients range from 1.0 (maximum positive correlation) to \u22121.0 (maximum anticorrelation), with a value of 0 representing no correlation. It is clear from the comparison of the two correlation plots in Fig. 3 that the changes between the diabetic and control animals were minimal for the correlation of glucose with alanine, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, citrate, allantoin, and creatinine. In diabetic rats, the correlation of glucose with urea was increased dramatically from 0.3 to 1, whereas the correlation of glucose with lactate decreased from 0.6 to 0. The correlation of citrate with alanine, lactate, and succinate was decreased from 0.9 to 0.4, from 0.8 to \u22120.3, and from 0.8 to \u22120.5, respectively, whereas the correlation of citrate with pyruvate, fumarate, and urea increased. Several metabolites showed a high positive correlation with one another in both diabetes and controls. For example, the metabolite pairs of acetate and ethanol, 2-oxoglutarate and citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and creatinine, and allantoin and creatinine showed high correlation (R > 0.9). Overall, for control rats, most metabolites correlate with one another with high correlation coefficients, as indicated by the predominantly red and orange regions in Fig. 3A, except that acetate, ethanol, and formate are relatively isolated from other metabolites and show blue stripes (|R| < 0.4) in the correlation network. In contrast, the increased blue regions in Fig. 3B for the diabetic animals indicate that a number of correlations are significantly decreased and show an overall decrease in metabolic correlation.\nUpon STZ administration, plasma glucose showed elevated levels, with its quantity being nearly three times higher than in control rats, as anticipated. A number of other changes in blood parameters are also observed (Table 1). However, much more dramatic changes are seen in the urine, as indicated by the 1H NMR data. This is further shown using a quantitative metabolomics approach, in which a distinct classification of diabetic and normal rats is observed (Fig. 2A and B). Statistical analysis of the NMR data, even after removing the glucose signals, showed a number of metabolites contributing to the clear separation of diabetic animals from control animals (Fig. 2C and D). This is corroborated by the high metabolite mean ratios (>2) of 8 of the metabolites (Table 2). As described below, a detailed analysis of the metabolite correlation matrices (Fig. 3) in combination with their altered metabolite levels indicates a significantly altered metabolism in the glucose metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles and the effect of gut microbial metabolism in rat diabetes. Fig. 4 compiles these observations based on the KEGG metabolic pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Each metabolite is designated using a specific shape and is filled with a specific color to indicate correlations and altered quantities, respectively. Four types of shapes are used to indicate diverse correlations among the observed 17 metabolites, whereas the five different colors are used to indicate the changes in quantities of these metabolites. Three colored borders are used to differentiate the correlations with three key metabolites: glucose (blue), acetate (purple), and creatinine (pink). Black and purple arrows are used to differentiate mammalian pathways from bacterial pathways. The origin and implications of these relationships are discussed below in terms of the altered glucose metabolism, the TCA cycle, and symbiotic metabolism observed in this study.\nIncreased glucose in diabetes is due in large part to the enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP) from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis) and the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). It has been shown that glycogenolysis was the major factor causing EGP in early stage insulin deficiency . At a later stage, especially for type 1 diabetes, EGP is attributed mainly to gluconeogenesis fueled by amino acids from degraded protein or dietary ingestion. Although such findings are still somewhat in question due to the lack of reliability in the quantitative measurements , our studies support this hypothesis. In particular, significantly or moderately increased levels of alanine and urea with glucose in diabetes and their increased correlation with one another clearly suggest enhanced amino acids-fueled EGP in diabetes. The increased alanine concentration found in this study for the diabetic rats is in agreement with reports on human type 1 and type 2 diabetes . An observed increased correlation of glucose with alanine but not with lactate in diabetic rats suggests that the EGP might be associated more closely with amino acids than with lactate even though the EGP effect from lactate is normally double that arising from alanine . The observations of severely enhanced lactate in both diabetic urine (Table 2) and plasma indicate a significantly reduced consumption of lactate compared with its production. The association of EGP with protein/amino acid metabolism in diabetes was also evident from the observed urea changes. The increased urea average content in both plasma and urine (Tables 1 and 2) in the diabetic animals suggests an increasing nitrogen load to the liver where urea is formed. We observed remarkable changes in the relationship between urea and glucose; there is essentially no correlation between these two metabolites (R = 0.3) in the control animals, whereas a strikingly high correlation between glucose and urea (R = 1.0) develops in diabetes (Fig. 3). The correlation agrees with a known fact that the amino-acid-fueled EGP enhances the nitrogen load on the liver and, consequently, urea synthesis is closely related to glucose synthesis . Because we observed minimal loss of body mass, the high correlation between urea and glucose in diabetic samples more likely indicates that high glucose is fueled mainly by ingested amino acids along with likely reduced protein synthesis.\nA glucose homeostasis was observed in control rats from the positive correlation of glucose with both the gluconeogenesis precursors alanine, lactate, and pyruvate and the TCA cycle intermediates 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, succinate, and citrate. This can be explained by the fact that a good control of glucose catabolism and anabolism is highly associated with the glucose\u2013alanine and Cori (glucose\u2013lactate) cycles between peripheral tissues and the liver, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Both lactate and alanine are formed peripherally by glucose-derived pyruvate and are transported to the liver, where their carbon skeleton is reconverted to glucose. The maintenance of glucose homeostasis also demands a well-functioned TCA cycle capable of producing gluconeogenesis precursors and facilitating glucose oxidation. In addition to the observation that glucose correlates with the identified TCA cycle, it was found from our study that pyruvate (the glycolytic end product that enters the TCA cycle) correlates with the three detected TCA cycle intermediates: 2-oxoglurarate, fumarate, and citrate (Figs. 3A and 4). The metabolic profile from STZ-induced diabetes shows a dramatic perturbation of both glucose metabolism and the TCA cycle, as indicated in both Figs. 3B and 4. First, although glucose correlates highly with alanine, it fails to correlate with lactate (Fig. 3B), indicating that the Cori cycle might be perturbed. Second, the correlation of glucose with the TCA intermediates is markedly disturbed with decreasing or missing correlations with 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, and succinate. Third, the correlations among the TCA intermediates are also significantly altered; for example, succinate no longer correlates with 2-oxoglutarate and citrate in diabetic rats.\nAn accumulation of acetate in STZ-induced diabetic urine suggests a defective acetate switch, that is, the molecular switch that regulates the dissimilation and assimilation of acetate . The elevation of acetate indicates an increased acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (CoA) pool due to both exogenous (bacterial fermentation) and endogenous (mammalian) production . Mammalian up-regulation of acetyl\u2013CoA synthetase 2 (AceCS2) leads to an accumulation of acetate under ketogenic conditions . AceCS2 occurs in most organs but not in the liver, and its up-regulation in other organs stimulates liver excretion of acetate, which accumulates in the bloodstream . In addition, the reduced expression of mammalian AceCS1 (which converts acetate to acetyl\u2013CoA) might also contribute partially to acetate accumulation .\nThe observed correlations of acetate with ethanol, lactate, succinate, and formate suggest that the origin of these metabolites may be more microbial than mammalian. It is well known that gut bacteria produce these metabolites, and this evidence was also confirmed by an NMR study of gut fluid (jejunal aspirate) . Another in vitro 1H NMR spectroscopy study on bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae showed that the bacteria produced acetate, succinate, and ethanol in the presence of a carbon source such as glycerol . Furthermore, the quantity of these bacterial metabolites increased significantly with increasing bacterial count, establishing their link with the bacteria . The high correlation of acetate with succinate in diabetes (R = 1) versus their moderate correlation in controls (R = 0.6) is in agreement with the intestinal microbial overgrowth in STZ-induced rats . A strong association between acetate and ethanol was observed in both control and STZ rats. Detection of acetate and ethanol in the rat digestive tract was reported previously , and their enhancements in diabetes are consistent with our results. Alternatively, excess glucose can augment the carbon flux to the TCA cycle, inhibiting the expression of many TCA cycle enzymes and producing a number of partially oxidized metabolites (e.g., ethanol, lactate, formate, succinate). This situation is known as the bacterial Crabtree effect . In the current study, an explanation for the increased amounts of these bacterial metabolites in diabetic rat urine may be due to (i) an increase in bacterial metabolites produced in the gut of diabetic rats due to the microbial overgrowth, (ii) the Crabtree effect, or (iii) both effects (i) and (ii). Significant levels of bacterial metabolites observed in diabetic rats and their possible origin, gut microbes, could have significant implications for understanding and controlling the secondary effects of these acids on diabetic patients. However, a further investigation is needed to verify this microbial hypothesis.\nCholine is degraded via (i) mammalian pathways in which choline is converted to creatinine via dimethylglycine and (ii) symxenobiotic pathways in which choline is converted to methylamine by gut microbiota . A remarkable switch between dimethylglycine and dimethylamine was observed from our study. In controls, dimethylamine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylglycine fails to correlate with these metabolites. In diabetes, on the contrary, dimethyglycine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylamine fails to correlate with these metabolites. The reasons causing such a correlative switch are still unclear at this stage. The significant enhancement of dimethylglycine observed in STZ\u2013diabetic rats may suggest an increased mammalian uptake of dietary choline. Alternatively, an enhanced conversion of choline to dimethylglycine may occur as compared with its conversions to dimethylamine (no observed difference between control and diabetes) or phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4). The altered choline metabolism could be accounted for by the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver weight in diabetic rats, as observed from our study (Table 1). High blood glucose levels in the presence of even low insulin levels stimulate the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis . Insufficient conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine exacerbates fatty liver and results in accumulation of triglycerides in plasma . It is possible that the conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine was reduced due to its potentially enhanced conversion to dimethyglycine in diabetic rats. More studies are required to understand in detail the specific reasons for such a switch in the correlations among the metabolites of the choline pathway.\nElevation of lactate and pyruvate from the STZ\u2013diabetic rats indicates an increased glycolysis. Because muscle cells in these STZ rats will be glucose starved and would likely oxidize all of the carbon from glucose through oxidative phosphorylation, the high levels of pyruvate and lactate might instead stem from glycolic production of lactate at the level of the red blood cells (RBCs) , which express a variant of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. It is also possible that other non-insulin-sensitive tissues are metabolizing glucose to lactate, which can be interconverted to pyruvate. This pathway may provide a good compensatory mechanism given that the monocarboxylase transporters, which carry lactate into and out of muscle cells, are not insulin sensitive. Thus, lactate would enter the cell and be converted to pyruvate. However, this scenario does not rule out the possibility of a gut microbial production contribution to the enhanced lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Further investigations need to be carried out to discern the origin of accumulated lactate and pyruvate.\nThe TBARS concentration in plasma has been used as an oxidative stress biomarker associated with the presence and amount of final fat degradation products induced by free radicals, and it has been shown to be increased in diabetes and to decrease after treatment with antioxidants . This parameter has been highly criticized because of its lack of specificity , and although it should not be used alone to reach conclusions, it may add information if used in combination with other oxidative stress biomarkers.\nIn conclusion, this NMR-based metabolomics approach is useful for the identification and quantitation of high-concentration but important metabolites, and it provides significant information for improving the understanding of disease through the identification of altered metabolic pathways and networks. The urinary metabolites show dramatic changes in this rat diabetic model when compared with blood-based assays. Correlations among the detected metabolites show a number of striking differences between the diabetic and control rats. Metabolomics-based approaches that identify altered mammalian and symbiotic pathways observed in induced diabetes in rats will be useful for providing additional detailed knowledge concerning metabolic pathways associated with diabetes. Application of these methods to human diabetic patients and a comparison with the derived metabolite and pathway correlations may provide information for identifying additional factors associated with molecular genesis of diabetes and oxidative stress."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nNanosized materials have attracted widespread attention for their special features different from bulk materials since 1990s. Because of their high activity, good selectivity and small size, chemical sensors based on nanosized materials have been developed rapidly. For example, the individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)-based chemical sensors capable of detecting small concentrations of gas molecules have been realized . Boron-doped silicon nanowire nanosensors have showed highly sensitive and selective detection of biological and chemical species . Palladium mesowire arrays for detection of hydrogen has been described based upon resistivity changes caused by the changes in the structure of the wire itself .\nSensing gas molecules is critical to industry monitoring, control of chemical processes, medical applications, environmental processes, and so on. The detection and quantification of ethanol, for instance, with high sensitivity and selectivity are required in many different fields. One of the important applications is to aid police in apprehending drink-driving offenders as a breath analyzer. Blood ethanol concentration can also be determined from its concentration in breath, a blood/breath alcohol partition ratio of 2000 having been widely adopted . In certain industry areas, such as fermentation and distillation, the ethanol vapor concentration can reach toxic levels, causing inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane and conjunctiva, irritation of the skin. The maximum permitted concentration of ethanol vapor in the work place as defined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is 1000 ppm.\nAn efficient way is therefore required for measuring gaseous substances, including ethanol vapor, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The alcohol sensors based on nanosized materials have been studied extensively by using electrochemical methods. Sensor materials including tin oxides , rare earth oxides and other ethanol-sensing semiconducting materials have been widely investigated. However, these sensors are also sensitive to some foreign substances, such as hydrocarbon, gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen, which unfortunately interfere with the alcohol detection. In addition, more and more attention was paid to gas sensors based on the optical properties of nanosized materials. For instance, porous-silicon ethanol sensor was developed based on the shift of the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot fringes by using laser interferometry method . Quantitative detection utilizing the quenching of photoluminescence of porous-silicon by NOx, SO2 and organic compounds has been developed . Chemiluminescence (CL) generated on the surface of nanosized materials was firstly observed during the mixture of porous-silicon and nitric acid , but no further analytical application based on the phenomenon has been developed. In recent years, Nakagawa and coworkers observed CL phenomena during the catalytic oxidation of organic vapors on the bulk materials of \u03b3-aluminum oxide (\u03b3-Al2O3) and \u03b3-Al2O3 activated by Dy3+ . However, their research work utilizing this kind of luminescence was limited to the two bulk solids. Strong CL observed from organic gases oxidized on six nanosized materials was firstly reported in our previous work . The details regarding analytical characteristics of the sensors were not involved in the paper since it is the very preliminary work. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the potentials of this new type of sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 material for the detection of ethanol by means of sensitivity, selectivity and lifetime as evaluation parameters. Nanosized SrCO3 was selected because this material showed excellent analytical characteristics over other five materials.\nThe possible mechanism of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 has been studied in the paper by using gas chromatography (GC). As we know, the mechanism of gas-phase CL from the oxidation of some organic and inorganic gases by O3 has been studied intensively, such as NO+O3, SO+O3, unsaturated hydrocarbons + O3, etc. , which has been reviewed in a book . However, the CL mechanism about gases oxidized on solid catalysts was little studied except for several reports . Only one mechanism mode of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on bulk material of \u03b3-Al2O3 was proposed, which attributed CL species to formaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethylene that originated from ethanol . The following Eqs. (1) and (2) show the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 resulted in the same CL phenomenon that has been observed during the oxidation of ethylene by O3 : C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O 3C2H4+3O2\u21926HCHO+h\u03bd In this paper, however, CL can be found not only during the course of ethylene oxidation, but also from the oxidation of acetaldehyde that is another intermediate of the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3. According to the different CL phenomena not observed before and the results from GC experiments, the possible mechanism about the reaction of ethanol oxidation resulted in CL is discussed.\nThe CL detection system consists of a SrCO3 sensor and a commercial optical detector. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the SrCO3 sensor. It can be seen that a cylindrical ceramic heater of 5 mm diameter was put in a quartz tube of 12 mm inner diameter. This ceramic heater was operated at required temperature by using an electric wire inserted into the ceramic tube. Outside of the ceramic tube, a 0.5 mm layer of SrCO3 powder was sintered on the surface. The sample gas can flow only through the outside of ceramic heater because this ceramic tube is solid. The main reaction between sensor substrate and sample molecules occurred on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 powder. The CL intensity at a certain wavelength was measured with a BPCL Ultra Weak Chemiluminescence Analyzer (made by Biophysics Institute of Chinese Academy of Science in China) through variable optical filters. The SrCO3 sensor was heated at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min in air to avoid the influence of previous absorbates at the beginning of each series of experiments.\nA simple chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of nanosized SrCO3 was developed as follows: 0.1 M SrCl2 solution and 0.1 M Na2CO3 solution were firstly cooled to 2 \u00b0C. Then the Na2CO3 solution was rapidly added into the stirring SrCl2 solution at the ratios of 1:1. Immediately, the precipitation was filtered and washed with di-ionized water for five times. All of the chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical grade.\nThe topography and particle size of SrCO3 were measured using a Hitachi H-800 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The accelerating voltage of electron beam was 200 kV. Fig. 2 shows that the grain size of SrCO3 is about 60\u201370 nm. X-ray power diffraction (XRD) experiment was carried out in Rigaku DMAX-2400 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. From Fig. 3 , we can find that these peaks are attributed to the pure strontianite-type crystal according to the XRD standard spectrum of SrCO3 crystal. The average crystal sizes can be determined from the XRD pattern parameters according to the Scherrer equation: D C=K \u03bb/\u03b2 cos \u03b8, where D C is the average crystal size, K is the Scherrer constant equal to 0.89, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength equal to 0.1542 nm, \u03b2 is the full width at half-maximum and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle. The average size of SrCO3 crystal synthesized in this article is about 25 nm.\nIn order to investigate the catalytic reaction processes that involve CL emission, GC experiments were carried out to identify the intermediates from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3. The SP-502 GC instrument with a flame ionization detector (FID detector, made in Lunan Chemical Engineering & Instrument Company of P.R.C., equipped with a GDX403 column, size 1.5 m\u00d74 mm) was directly coupled to the CL detection system mentioned earlier for the rapid determination of intermediates from the ethanol oxidation. Products were identified by comparison of their retention time to that of the standard compounds from Huayuan Gas Cooperation in Beijing. The conditions for GC experiments were as follows: temperature of spray chamber operated at 120 \u00b0C, column temperature operated at 100 \u00b0C, pressure of carrier gas of Ar kept at 0.38 MPa.\nThe CL response profile of ethanol was studied by the injection of ethanol vapor with different concentrations into the carrier gas with a flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 4 shows the CL response profiles of 70 ml ethanol vapor on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 at 380 \u00b0C with a bandpass filter of 425 nm. Curves 1\u20133 denote the results for different concentrations of 750, 1500 and 2250 ppm, respectively. The CL signal increased sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor was introduced. There is a systematic increase of CL intensity with the increasing ethanol concentration. Fig. 4 also shows that the peaks of each curve appear at 7 s after sample injection, which means rapid response of this sensor to ethanol, and the profiles are similar to each other. The half decay time of CL intensity of each curve is about 30 s. The decay is related to the luminescent product and the dead volume of the used instrument.\nFig. 5 shows the CL spectra emitted from the SrCO3 sensor during the process of catalytic oxidation of ethanol vapor at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. The temperature corresponding to curves 1\u20133 is 400, 380 and 350 \u00b0C, respectively. It can be seen that the profile of each curves in the figure are similar and each curves have the same peak at around 425, 460 and 530 nm, which means the same luminescent species was produced at different temperatures. But with the increasing of sensor temperature, the CL peak at 530 nm becomes higher than other two. This is to say, CL peak positions are independent of the tested temperatures that will affect the relative CL intensity.\nAs shown in Fig. 6 , the relative S/N (signal to background noise) ratios versus wavelength at three different temperatures are established. The profiles of curves 1\u20133 are similar to each other. It shows that there are also three peaks at the same positions with Fig. 5. The position of the highest peak is at 425 nm independent of temperature, which is different from Fig. 5. In fact, the background and noise signal at longer wavelength are much higher than those at short wavelength because of the incandescence of ceramic heater at high temperature. Although the CL signal is much higher at 530 nm than other wavelengths at 400 \u00b0C as shown in Fig. 5, the S/N value at 530 nm is still lower than that at 425 and 460 nm. From Fig. 6, the profiles of S/N ratios to wavelength are little affected by the tested temperatures. So, the wavelength of 425 nm is chosen for the further study of analytical characteristics.\nTemperature dependence of the CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol was measured under the bandpass of 425 nm and at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 7 denotes that the CL signal increases with the increase in temperature from 350 to 470 \u00b0C. It can be attributed to the higher conversion of ethanol on SrCO3 in high temperature, which will be explained later in the paper. However, according to the values of S/N versus temperature, the maximum value of S/N could be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 \u00b0C; under or above the temperature causes decrease in the value of S/N. The reason is probably that the noise signal also increases with the temperature increasing, and even increases faster than the CL intensity at higher temperature. Therefore, the temperature of 380 \u00b0C was selected for the further work in the paper.\nThe flow rate dependence of the CL intensity at 425 nm was measured at 380 \u00b0C from 50 to 350 ml/min as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol increases with an increase in the flow rate, and it saturates above a certain flow rate F (280 ml/min). This directly shows that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below F, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above F. For the further analysis of the proposed method in the paper, the flow rate of 300 ml/min was selected.\nUnder the selected conditions described earlier for the performance of the proposed method, the calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was linear in the range of 6\u20133750 ppm with a detection limit (3\u03c3) of 2.1 ppm, as shown in Fig. 9 . The line regression equation is described by lg I=1.07\u00d7lg C+1.37 (r=0.998, n=8, \u2018r\u2019 is the relative coefficient, and \u2018n\u2019 represents that eight ethanol concentrations were tested in the experiment), where I is the CL intensity and C is the concentration of ethanol vapor. Relative standard deviations (RSD, n=8) were 3.08%, 2.82% and 1.30% for 30, 300 and 3000 ppm ethanol vapor, respectively.\nForeign substances, such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons (cigarette smoke) and hydrogen, sometimes would unfortunately interfere with the alcohol measurements. For example, some semiconductor oxide sensors based on the change in electrical resistance of substrate materials are sensitive to ethanol, but they are also sensitive to some other gases . In order to obtain high selectivity for sensing gaseous substances, gas microchromatography has been attempted by applying micromachining technologies . This method has some disadvantages, however, such as low response and structural complication. Fig. 10 presents the selectivity of the SrCO3 sensor based on CL to a number of gases with the same concentration of 1000 ppm. It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. Under the optimized conditions, it is very interesting to note that there was no response of the sensor while gasoline, ammonia or hydrogen passing over the CL detection system. There are three possibilities: firstly, no reaction happens between sample gases with SrCO3; secondly, no CL was produced although sample gases can react with SrCO3; and thirdly, emitted CL signal is too weak to be detected under the optimized conditions mentioned before. To n-hexane, the interfering would not be obvious since its lower sensitivity than ethanol.\nIn order to check the stability and durability of this sensor, one experiment was carried out by continuously introducing 2000 ppm ethanol vapor to the sensor at 380 \u00b0C with the flow rate of 300 ml/min. The CL intensity was measured at the bandpass of 425 nm. The result shows that, after 100 h reaction, no obvious change can be found. The RSD (n=17) during the 100 h reaction is about 1.02%, which means that the sensor keeps the same response to ethanol vapor. As shown in Fig. 11 , the lifetime of TiO2 as the sensing material has also been studied in our previous work . It can be seen that, after 60 h reaction, the CL intensity decayed to about one-half of its original brightness. The Raman spectra showed that the carbon originated from the ethanol oxidation decreased the catalytic activity by depositing on the surface of TiO2, but can be removed in air by controlling the temperature at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h. As compared with the TiO2, the present SrCO3 sensor shows better stability and durability.\nFor the study of CL mechanism of the SrCO3 sensor, GC experiments were carried out to detect the intermediates of the catalytic oxidation of ethanol. As in the case of ethanol vapor, it is well known that there are two oxidation states of ethanol. C2H5OH+12O2\u2192CH3CHO+H2O C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O The first reaction shown in Eq. (3) is a process initiating the oxidation by the dehydrogenation to CH3CHO intermediate and the second reaction in Eq. (4) is initiated by the dehydration to C2H4. The intermediates products, acetaldehyde and ethylene will then be subsequently converted to carbon dioxide and water. The GC chromatogram (shown in Fig. 12A ) for the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 at 350 \u00b0C approves the given statement. It can be seen that there are three peaks corresponding to C2H4, CH3CHO and C2H5OH, respectively, which can be identified by comparison of the retention time of the standard gases in GC. Fig. 12B shows that with the temperature increasing, the content of the products from the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 changed. The peak height of GC chromatogram corresponds to the content of this compound in the products. It can be seen that ethanol was mostly converted into ethylene in the high temperature regions, and mostly transformed to acetaldehyde in the low temperature regions. It also shows that with the conversion of ethanol improved in high temperature, the CL intensity also increased. This result can be used to explain the phenomenon that the CL intensity increased with the increasing temperature as shown in Fig. 7.\nIn order to test the real CL procedure, C2H4 and CH3CHO were directly introduced into the sensor to see if the same emission is produced. CL was observed while C2H4 or CH3CHO passing through the SrCO3 sensor. Fig. 13 shows temperature dependence of the relative CL intensity measured at 425 nm from the oxidation of CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3, and the conversion of them after passing through the SrCO3 sensor, respectively. It can be seen that the CL intensity and conversion of this two gases increases with the temperature increasing, which is same with that of ethanol. This is to say, the CL phenomenon from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 can be attributed to the oxidation processes of the two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation, as shown in the following Scheme 1 .Different from the report by Nakagawa and coworkers , another way resulted in CL was found besides the oxidation of C2H4 shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). For comparison, the CL spectra of C2H5OH, CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3 at 400 \u00b0C were measured, respectively. Fig. 14 shows that in the short wavelength region, the CL spectra of the three gases are similar to each other, and the CL from C2H5OH in long wavelength region shall owe to that from CH3CHO. This is to say, the CL emission processes of ethylene and acetaldehyde oxidized on SrCO3 are different. However, the electronically excited intermediate is still unknown according to the results. In fact, electronically excited formaldehyde, (HCHO)\u2217, has been confirmed as a chemiluminescing species common to all the ozone\u2013olefin reactions in terms of the gas-phase Criegie mechanism . Furthermore, HCHO as the major intermediate from the oxidation of ethylene by O3 was observed at reaction times of \u223c130 ms by utilizing photoionizaiton mass spectrometer . However, no peak of HCHO appeared after C2H4 passing through the SrCO3 sensor in our experiment. Also, the intermediate product of HCHO was not mentioned during the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 in the literatures . According to the GC analysis, we found that HCHO as the intermediate originated from ethanol can easily be oxidized to CO2 by SrCO3. Accordingly, the existing lifetime of HCHO is so short that it cannot be transferred into the GC instrument. To CH3CHO oxidation, no other peak was observed in GC chromatogram except the peak of acetaldehyde. The CL phenomenon observed during the oxidation of acetaldehyde by O3 has also been reported, which was attributed to vibrationally excited OH . But the CL spectrum measured from 500 to 1100 nm in the literature is different from that measured from 400 to 560 nm at 400 \u00b0C in the study. Further work is required to identify the radical intermediates and explain the formation of them.\nA novel alcohol sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 in this article was firstly developed according to the generated CL from catalytic oxidation of ethanol. The simple sensor presents rapid response to ethanol vapor and is easy to operate. Wide linear response, high sensitivity, and satisfied stability show promise of this sensor for ethanol determination. This sensor also showed high selectivity to ethanol, and no interference was observed by gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen. No consumption of sensor substrate signifies the long lifetime of the gas sensor. The excellent performance surely makes the SrCO3 sensor 1 suitable for any situation where there is need for ethanol detection in areas such as breath checker and industry monitor. Also, the work is potential for the development of nanosensor based on a couple of nanoparticles, which would make the miniaturize equipment utilizing CL possible.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Nanosized materials have attracted widespread attention for their special features different from bulk materials since 1990s. Because of their high activity, good selectivity and small size, chemical sensors based on nanosized materials have been developed rapidly. For example, the individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)-based chemical sensors capable of detecting small concentrations of gas molecules have been realized . Boron-doped silicon nanowire nanosensors have showed highly sensitive and selective detection of biological and chemical species . Palladium mesowire arrays for detection of hydrogen has been described based upon resistivity changes caused by the changes in the structure of the wire itself .\nSensing gas molecules is critical to industry monitoring, control of chemical processes, medical applications, environmental processes, and so on. The detection and quantification of ethanol, for instance, with high sensitivity and selectivity are required in many different fields. One of the important applications is to aid police in apprehending drink-driving offenders as a breath analyzer. Blood ethanol concentration can also be determined from its concentration in breath, a blood/breath alcohol partition ratio of 2000 having been widely adopted . In certain industry areas, such as fermentation and distillation, the ethanol vapor concentration can reach toxic levels, causing inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane and conjunctiva, irritation of the skin. The maximum permitted concentration of ethanol vapor in the work place as defined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is 1000 ppm.\nAn efficient way is therefore required for measuring gaseous substances, including ethanol vapor, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The alcohol sensors based on nanosized materials have been studied extensively by using electrochemical methods. Sensor materials including tin oxides , rare earth oxides and other ethanol-sensing semiconducting materials have been widely investigated. However, these sensors are also sensitive to some foreign substances, such as hydrocarbon, gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen, which unfortunately interfere with the alcohol detection. In addition, more and more attention was paid to gas sensors based on the optical properties of nanosized materials. For instance, porous-silicon ethanol sensor was developed based on the shift of the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot fringes by using laser interferometry method . Quantitative detection utilizing the quenching of photoluminescence of porous-silicon by NOx, SO2 and organic compounds has been developed . Chemiluminescence (CL) generated on the surface of nanosized materials was firstly observed during the mixture of porous-silicon and nitric acid , but no further analytical application based on the phenomenon has been developed. In recent years, Nakagawa and coworkers observed CL phenomena during the catalytic oxidation of organic vapors on the bulk materials of \u03b3-aluminum oxide (\u03b3-Al2O3) and \u03b3-Al2O3 activated by Dy3+ . However, their research work utilizing this kind of luminescence was limited to the two bulk solids. Strong CL observed from organic gases oxidized on six nanosized materials was firstly reported in our previous work . The details regarding analytical characteristics of the sensors were not involved in the paper since it is the very preliminary work. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the potentials of this new type of sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 material for the detection of ethanol by means of sensitivity, selectivity and lifetime as evaluation parameters. Nanosized SrCO3 was selected because this material showed excellent analytical characteristics over other five materials.\nThe possible mechanism of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 has been studied in the paper by using gas chromatography (GC). As we know, the mechanism of gas-phase CL from the oxidation of some organic and inorganic gases by O3 has been studied intensively, such as NO+O3, SO+O3, unsaturated hydrocarbons + O3, etc. , which has been reviewed in a book . However, the CL mechanism about gases oxidized on solid catalysts was little studied except for several reports . Only one mechanism mode of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on bulk material of \u03b3-Al2O3 was proposed, which attributed CL species to formaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethylene that originated from ethanol . The following Eqs. (1) and (2) show the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 resulted in the same CL phenomenon that has been observed during the oxidation of ethylene by O3 : C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O 3C2H4+3O2\u21926HCHO+h\u03bd In this paper, however, CL can be found not only during the course of ethylene oxidation, but also from the oxidation of acetaldehyde that is another intermediate of the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3. According to the different CL phenomena not observed before and the results from GC experiments, the possible mechanism about the reaction of ethanol oxidation resulted in CL is discussed.\nThe CL detection system consists of a SrCO3 sensor and a commercial optical detector. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the SrCO3 sensor. It can be seen that a cylindrical ceramic heater of 5 mm diameter was put in a quartz tube of 12 mm inner diameter. This ceramic heater was operated at required temperature by using an electric wire inserted into the ceramic tube. Outside of the ceramic tube, a 0.5 mm layer of SrCO3 powder was sintered on the surface. The sample gas can flow only through the outside of ceramic heater because this ceramic tube is solid. The main reaction between sensor substrate and sample molecules occurred on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 powder. The CL intensity at a certain wavelength was measured with a BPCL Ultra Weak Chemiluminescence Analyzer (made by Biophysics Institute of Chinese Academy of Science in China) through variable optical filters. The SrCO3 sensor was heated at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min in air to avoid the influence of previous absorbates at the beginning of each series of experiments.\nA simple chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of nanosized SrCO3 was developed as follows: 0.1 M SrCl2 solution and 0.1 M Na2CO3 solution were firstly cooled to 2 \u00b0C. Then the Na2CO3 solution was rapidly added into the stirring SrCl2 solution at the ratios of 1:1. Immediately, the precipitation was filtered and washed with di-ionized water for five times. All of the chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical grade.\nThe topography and particle size of SrCO3 were measured using a Hitachi H-800 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The accelerating voltage of electron beam was 200 kV. Fig. 2 shows that the grain size of SrCO3 is about 60\u201370 nm. X-ray power diffraction (XRD) experiment was carried out in Rigaku DMAX-2400 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. From Fig. 3 , we can find that these peaks are attributed to the pure strontianite-type crystal according to the XRD standard spectrum of SrCO3 crystal. The average crystal sizes can be determined from the XRD pattern parameters according to the Scherrer equation: D C=K \u03bb/\u03b2 cos \u03b8, where D C is the average crystal size, K is the Scherrer constant equal to 0.89, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength equal to 0.1542 nm, \u03b2 is the full width at half-maximum and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle. The average size of SrCO3 crystal synthesized in this article is about 25 nm.\nIn order to investigate the catalytic reaction processes that involve CL emission, GC experiments were carried out to identify the intermediates from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3. The SP-502 GC instrument with a flame ionization detector (FID detector, made in Lunan Chemical Engineering & Instrument Company of P.R.C., equipped with a GDX403 column, size 1.5 m\u00d74 mm) was directly coupled to the CL detection system mentioned earlier for the rapid determination of intermediates from the ethanol oxidation. Products were identified by comparison of their retention time to that of the standard compounds from Huayuan Gas Cooperation in Beijing. The conditions for GC experiments were as follows: temperature of spray chamber operated at 120 \u00b0C, column temperature operated at 100 \u00b0C, pressure of carrier gas of Ar kept at 0.38 MPa.\nThe CL response profile of ethanol was studied by the injection of ethanol vapor with different concentrations into the carrier gas with a flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 4 shows the CL response profiles of 70 ml ethanol vapor on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 at 380 \u00b0C with a bandpass filter of 425 nm. Curves 1\u20133 denote the results for different concentrations of 750, 1500 and 2250 ppm, respectively. The CL signal increased sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor was introduced. There is a systematic increase of CL intensity with the increasing ethanol concentration. Fig. 4 also shows that the peaks of each curve appear at 7 s after sample injection, which means rapid response of this sensor to ethanol, and the profiles are similar to each other. The half decay time of CL intensity of each curve is about 30 s. The decay is related to the luminescent product and the dead volume of the used instrument.\nFig. 5 shows the CL spectra emitted from the SrCO3 sensor during the process of catalytic oxidation of ethanol vapor at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. The temperature corresponding to curves 1\u20133 is 400, 380 and 350 \u00b0C, respectively. It can be seen that the profile of each curves in the figure are similar and each curves have the same peak at around 425, 460 and 530 nm, which means the same luminescent species was produced at different temperatures. But with the increasing of sensor temperature, the CL peak at 530 nm becomes higher than other two. This is to say, CL peak positions are independent of the tested temperatures that will affect the relative CL intensity.\nAs shown in Fig. 6 , the relative S/N (signal to background noise) ratios versus wavelength at three different temperatures are established. The profiles of curves 1\u20133 are similar to each other. It shows that there are also three peaks at the same positions with Fig. 5. The position of the highest peak is at 425 nm independent of temperature, which is different from Fig. 5. In fact, the background and noise signal at longer wavelength are much higher than those at short wavelength because of the incandescence of ceramic heater at high temperature. Although the CL signal is much higher at 530 nm than other wavelengths at 400 \u00b0C as shown in Fig. 5, the S/N value at 530 nm is still lower than that at 425 and 460 nm. From Fig. 6, the profiles of S/N ratios to wavelength are little affected by the tested temperatures. So, the wavelength of 425 nm is chosen for the further study of analytical characteristics.\nTemperature dependence of the CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol was measured under the bandpass of 425 nm and at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 7 denotes that the CL signal increases with the increase in temperature from 350 to 470 \u00b0C. It can be attributed to the higher conversion of ethanol on SrCO3 in high temperature, which will be explained later in the paper. However, according to the values of S/N versus temperature, the maximum value of S/N could be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 \u00b0C; under or above the temperature causes decrease in the value of S/N. The reason is probably that the noise signal also increases with the temperature increasing, and even increases faster than the CL intensity at higher temperature. Therefore, the temperature of 380 \u00b0C was selected for the further work in the paper.\nThe flow rate dependence of the CL intensity at 425 nm was measured at 380 \u00b0C from 50 to 350 ml/min as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol increases with an increase in the flow rate, and it saturates above a certain flow rate F (280 ml/min). This directly shows that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below F, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above F. For the further analysis of the proposed method in the paper, the flow rate of 300 ml/min was selected.\nUnder the selected conditions described earlier for the performance of the proposed method, the calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was linear in the range of 6\u20133750 ppm with a detection limit (3\u03c3) of 2.1 ppm, as shown in Fig. 9 . The line regression equation is described by lg I=1.07\u00d7lg C+1.37 (r=0.998, n=8, \u2018r\u2019 is the relative coefficient, and \u2018n\u2019 represents that eight ethanol concentrations were tested in the experiment), where I is the CL intensity and C is the concentration of ethanol vapor. Relative standard deviations (RSD, n=8) were 3.08%, 2.82% and 1.30% for 30, 300 and 3000 ppm ethanol vapor, respectively.\nForeign substances, such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons (cigarette smoke) and hydrogen, sometimes would unfortunately interfere with the alcohol measurements. For example, some semiconductor oxide sensors based on the change in electrical resistance of substrate materials are sensitive to ethanol, but they are also sensitive to some other gases . In order to obtain high selectivity for sensing gaseous substances, gas microchromatography has been attempted by applying micromachining technologies . This method has some disadvantages, however, such as low response and structural complication. Fig. 10 presents the selectivity of the SrCO3 sensor based on CL to a number of gases with the same concentration of 1000 ppm. It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. Under the optimized conditions, it is very interesting to note that there was no response of the sensor while gasoline, ammonia or hydrogen passing over the CL detection system. There are three possibilities: firstly, no reaction happens between sample gases with SrCO3; secondly, no CL was produced although sample gases can react with SrCO3; and thirdly, emitted CL signal is too weak to be detected under the optimized conditions mentioned before. To n-hexane, the interfering would not be obvious since its lower sensitivity than ethanol.\nIn order to check the stability and durability of this sensor, one experiment was carried out by continuously introducing 2000 ppm ethanol vapor to the sensor at 380 \u00b0C with the flow rate of 300 ml/min. The CL intensity was measured at the bandpass of 425 nm. The result shows that, after 100 h reaction, no obvious change can be found. The RSD (n=17) during the 100 h reaction is about 1.02%, which means that the sensor keeps the same response to ethanol vapor. As shown in Fig. 11 , the lifetime of TiO2 as the sensing material has also been studied in our previous work . It can be seen that, after 60 h reaction, the CL intensity decayed to about one-half of its original brightness. The Raman spectra showed that the carbon originated from the ethanol oxidation decreased the catalytic activity by depositing on the surface of TiO2, but can be removed in air by controlling the temperature at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h. As compared with the TiO2, the present SrCO3 sensor shows better stability and durability.\nFor the study of CL mechanism of the SrCO3 sensor, GC experiments were carried out to detect the intermediates of the catalytic oxidation of ethanol. As in the case of ethanol vapor, it is well known that there are two oxidation states of ethanol. C2H5OH+12O2\u2192CH3CHO+H2O C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O The first reaction shown in Eq. (3) is a process initiating the oxidation by the dehydrogenation to CH3CHO intermediate and the second reaction in Eq. (4) is initiated by the dehydration to C2H4. The intermediates products, acetaldehyde and ethylene will then be subsequently converted to carbon dioxide and water. The GC chromatogram (shown in Fig. 12A ) for the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 at 350 \u00b0C approves the given statement. It can be seen that there are three peaks corresponding to C2H4, CH3CHO and C2H5OH, respectively, which can be identified by comparison of the retention time of the standard gases in GC. Fig. 12B shows that with the temperature increasing, the content of the products from the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 changed. The peak height of GC chromatogram corresponds to the content of this compound in the products. It can be seen that ethanol was mostly converted into ethylene in the high temperature regions, and mostly transformed to acetaldehyde in the low temperature regions. It also shows that with the conversion of ethanol improved in high temperature, the CL intensity also increased. This result can be used to explain the phenomenon that the CL intensity increased with the increasing temperature as shown in Fig. 7.\nIn order to test the real CL procedure, C2H4 and CH3CHO were directly introduced into the sensor to see if the same emission is produced. CL was observed while C2H4 or CH3CHO passing through the SrCO3 sensor. Fig. 13 shows temperature dependence of the relative CL intensity measured at 425 nm from the oxidation of CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3, and the conversion of them after passing through the SrCO3 sensor, respectively. It can be seen that the CL intensity and conversion of this two gases increases with the temperature increasing, which is same with that of ethanol. This is to say, the CL phenomenon from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 can be attributed to the oxidation processes of the two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation, as shown in the following Scheme 1 .Different from the report by Nakagawa and coworkers , another way resulted in CL was found besides the oxidation of C2H4 shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). For comparison, the CL spectra of C2H5OH, CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3 at 400 \u00b0C were measured, respectively. Fig. 14 shows that in the short wavelength region, the CL spectra of the three gases are similar to each other, and the CL from C2H5OH in long wavelength region shall owe to that from CH3CHO. This is to say, the CL emission processes of ethylene and acetaldehyde oxidized on SrCO3 are different. However, the electronically excited intermediate is still unknown according to the results. In fact, electronically excited formaldehyde, (HCHO)\u2217, has been confirmed as a chemiluminescing species common to all the ozone\u2013olefin reactions in terms of the gas-phase Criegie mechanism . Furthermore, HCHO as the major intermediate from the oxidation of ethylene by O3 was observed at reaction times of \u223c130 ms by utilizing photoionizaiton mass spectrometer . However, no peak of HCHO appeared after C2H4 passing through the SrCO3 sensor in our experiment. Also, the intermediate product of HCHO was not mentioned during the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 in the literatures . According to the GC analysis, we found that HCHO as the intermediate originated from ethanol can easily be oxidized to CO2 by SrCO3. Accordingly, the existing lifetime of HCHO is so short that it cannot be transferred into the GC instrument. To CH3CHO oxidation, no other peak was observed in GC chromatogram except the peak of acetaldehyde. The CL phenomenon observed during the oxidation of acetaldehyde by O3 has also been reported, which was attributed to vibrationally excited OH . But the CL spectrum measured from 500 to 1100 nm in the literature is different from that measured from 400 to 560 nm at 400 \u00b0C in the study. Further work is required to identify the radical intermediates and explain the formation of them.\nA novel alcohol sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 in this article was firstly developed according to the generated CL from catalytic oxidation of ethanol. The simple sensor presents rapid response to ethanol vapor and is easy to operate. Wide linear response, high sensitivity, and satisfied stability show promise of this sensor for ethanol determination. This sensor also showed high selectivity to ethanol, and no interference was observed by gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen. No consumption of sensor substrate signifies the long lifetime of the gas sensor. The excellent performance surely makes the SrCO3 sensor 1 suitable for any situation where there is need for ethanol detection in areas such as breath checker and industry monitor. Also, the work is potential for the development of nanosensor based on a couple of nanoparticles, which would make the miniaturize equipment utilizing CL possible."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nPhthalate esters are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics to make them flexible. Extensive use of these chemicals resulted in their presence in various environmental matrices such as water, soil and food, including milk and other dairy products . Phthalate esters have endocrine disrupting properties . Studies have shown that phthalate esters are estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals . Because of the potential health impact on humans, the European Commission, for example, is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys .\nAmong all phthalate esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used plasticizer worldwide. DEHP is released to the environment through volatilization and leaching from plastics and other sources. Its widespread usage coupled with its persistence in the environment result in its ubiquitous presence in the environment and in biota including humans . DEHP levels in Danish retail whole milk samples were found at up to 0.14 mg kg\u22121 . A surveillance work on phthalate esters in Canadian dairy products and margarine has shown that the levels of DEHP and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) were up to 11.9 and 47.8 mg kg\u22121, respectively . Although Government of Canada does not have an permissible level of phthalates in milk or dairy products, it has recommended a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 44 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 for DEHP, in an assessment report in 1994 where the exposure of Canadians to DEHP from all sources was estimated at 5\u201319 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 depending on their age .\nSeveral analytical methods have been developed for determining phthalate esters in food samples . The most widely used approaches in sample preparation were liquid\u2013liquid solvent extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) . One of the drawbacks of using solvent in the sample preparation is that residues of phthalate esters, especially DEHP, are also found in solvents. Furthermore, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis by instrument analysis .\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) was introduced by Pawliszyn and Pawliszyn and Arthur in the early 1990s. In SPME, the extraction of target analytes from sample matrix to the fibre is conducted either directly, with the coated fibre directly immersed in the liquid sample (direct SPME), or in the headspace (HS-SPME), where the extracting fibre is suspended above the sample. Although suitable for the analysis of phthalate esters in water , sediments and sludge , the direct SPME method cannot be applied to complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products which often contain fat and other biological components.\nThe advantage of HS approach is the elimination of co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. Therefore, HS-SPME could be a potentially useful tool to selectively extract the phthalate esters, as the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix. However, thus far, HS-SPME has only been tested in the determination of phthalate esters in water . The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a HS-SPME based method to eliminate the fat removing procedure in the cow milk sample preparation prior to phthalate esters analysis with GC-MS (single ion monitoring, SIM) and (2) to apply this method to measure the levels of phthalate ester in milk samples collected at a dairy farm.\nA standard stock solution containing six phthalate esters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), in hexane at a level of 2000 ng \u03bcL\u22121 per compound was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 (100 ng \u03bcL\u22121) in nonane, used as internal standards in this study, were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). Dichloromethane (DCM) (GC Resolv Grade) was from Fisher Scientific (NJ, USA). Two secondary stock solutions (20 and 200 ng \u03bcL\u22121) and calibration standard solutions (0.1, 0.4, 1, 5 and 10 ng \u03bcL\u22121) were prepared by serial dilution in DCM using volumetric flasks. DBP-d4 and DEPH-d4 solution (20 ng \u03bcL\u22121) was prepared in the similar manner. Calibration standard solutions were spiked with DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 at a concentration level of 1 ng \u03bcL\u22121.\nSPME fibre holder and 10 different types of SPME fibres (see Table 1 ) were obtained from Supelco. Fifteen millilitres SPME clear vials with PTFE/Silicone lined screw top cap were also from Supelco. A VWR 575 Digital Hotplate and stirrers were from VWR International Ltd. (Mississauga, Ont., Canada). Vacuum pump fluid used for the heating bath was from Inland Vacuum Industries, Inc. (Churchville, NY, USA).\nFive grams of cow milk was weighed into a 15 mL SPME vial using a pipette. A magnetic stirring bar and 2.5 g of sodium chloride were added into the vial afterwards and the vial was then closed with the vial cap. The vial was tightly closed to avoid possible leakage of gas when the vial was heated. Then the vial was placed into a preheated oil bath (90 \u00b0C) on a hot plate. The stirring speed was adjusted to make the solution well stirred. After 2 min, the SPME needle then was punched through the cap into the headspace of the vial and the fibre was pushed out from the protection needle to start the sampling in the headspace. The SPME holder should be placed at a height that could result in the tip of the inserted fibre to be suspended about 1.5 cm above the milk sample. After the sampling was finished, the fibre was retracted into the protection needle. The needle was then removed from the sampling vial and inserted into a clean vial to protect the fibre from exposing to laboratory air. The needle was then immediately inserted into the GC injection port for GC/-MS analysis.\nA Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph (GC, HP 5890 series) coupled with a mass selective detector (MS, HP 5972 series) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for the analysis. The injection port was fitted with a SPME inlet guide (Supelco, Cat. No. 57356-U) and a pre-drilled Thermogreen LB-2 septa (Supelco, Cat. No. 23168) to secure the SPME fibre holder (Supelco, Cat. No. 57330-U). A special inlet liner for SPME used in this study was also from Supelco (Cat. No. 26375,05). The desorption of SPME fibre in the GC injection port was 10 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas off. After sample desorption, the fibre was further heated in the injection port for an additional 30 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas turned on to remove trace residues in the fibre while desorbed phthalate esters were being analyzed, before the next extraction. The fibre was then retracted into the protection needle and the needle was inserted into a clean vial, ready for the next sample extraction.\nAnalytes were separated on a 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness DB-5 gas chromatographic column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) with the following oven temperature program: the initial temperature was set at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, increased to 280 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C per minute and kept at 280 \u00b0C for 15 min.\nSelected ion monitoring mode was used for MS operation. Three ions (the first one being the target ion (T) and rest two the qualifying ions (Q1 and Q2)) were selected for each target compound. They were: m/z 163, 77 and 194 for DMP; m/z 149, 177 and 104 for DEP; m/z 149, 223 and 104 for DBP; m/z 149, 91 and 206 for BBP; m/z 149, 167 and 279 for DEHP; and m/z 149, 279 and 104 for DOP. One ion (m/z 153) was used for the quantification of both DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4. All peak area counts of the chromatograms were normalized against the internal standard DBP-d4 (for DMP, DEP and DBP, respectively) and DEHP-d4 (for BBP, DEHP and DOP, respectively) before data reduction. Each peak was manually checked by a qualified chemist for the identity and proper integration. However, a peak must have its retention time was within 1% and at least one of its two ion ratios (Q1/T or Q2/T) within \u00b130% of those of the associated standards to be considered positive.\nPhthalate esters are semi-volatile organic chemicals with vapour pressure ranging from 3.07 \u00d7 10\u22123 mmHg for DMP to 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22128 mmHg for DEHP (Table 1) . The low vapour pressure means that the concentration of phthalate esters in the headspace of SPME vials would be very low. On the other hand, direct SPME would not be appropriate due to the presence of fat and other biological components in the milk sample matrix. The development of the HS-SPME method was therefore focused on finding a proper extraction fibre and optimizing the extraction conditions such as extraction time and temperature.\nCommercially available SPME fibres for SPME can be divided into absorbent-type and adsorbent-type. Absorption type coating is a liquid film, which cross-linked to the silica rod, while adsorbent type fibres are solid particles with pores on the surface. The extraction of absorbent-type fibres is based on partitioning of analytes into a \u2018liquid-like\u2019 phase. In the case of adsorbent type fibres the particle surface interacts physically with the analytes . A total of 10 commercially available fibres with different coating materials and coating thickness (Table 1) were evaluated for their applicability to extract phthalate esters from milk samples. A commercial Homo-milk (3.25% fat) (spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each phthalate ester in 5 g milk) was used in the experiment. Table 1 summarizes the relative amount of phthalate esters collected on each fibre (normalized to the highest extracted amount among all phthalate esters) under the sample extraction condition of 90 \u00b0C for 60 min (see Section 3.2). Comparison of fibres for their extraction efficiency was also conducted at 50 \u00b0C. However, the overall amount of phthalate esters being collected was too low to be used for the purpose of selecting fibres, compared to the results obtained at 90 \u00b0C. For DMP and DEP, PDMS/DVB-StablFlex-65 \u03bcm and DVB/CAR/PDMS-50/30 \u03bcm fibres had the best results. However, for the rest of the phthalate esters listed in Table 1, PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre, a fused silica rod coated with a liquid film of cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane, had the best extraction efficiency. The ability of the coating phase to retain the analyte was also dependent on the coating thickness and the molecular weight of the analytes. It was observed that at the extraction temperature of 90 \u00b0C the extraction efficiency of the PDMS coated fibres for phthalate esters, except for DMP and DEP, was drastically reduced when the thickness of the coating was reduced from 100 to 30 \u03bcm and 7 \u03bcm. Such film thickness effects on extraction efficiency were however, not evident in the direct SPME of phthalate esters in water which was conducted at 25 \u00b0C . Such film thickness dependent extraction efficiency in headspace SPME in the case of higher molecular weight phthalate esters could be attributed to the retaining capacity of the film. The larger the liquid volume is, the more capacity of holding-back the phthalate esters the fibre possesses. For lower molecular weight phthalate esters, the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium dominates the extraction process and therefore the effects of film thickness are not significant.\nAlthough PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre had lower extraction efficiency for DMP and DEP. It was still selected as the extraction fibre for this study since DEHP and DBP are the two major phthalate esters detected in dairy products including milk . In addition, DEHP is the most important analyte in this study to achieve the objective of assessing potential migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into milk samples during milking.\nTo compensate for the low vapour pressures of phthalate esters, a high extraction temperature is desirable to accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase the concentration of the esters in the headspace. There are two governing equilibriums (gas phase \u2194 sample matrix and gas phase \u2194 liquid coating of the fibre) in HS-SPME. The high temperature would increase the concentration in the gas phase, however, it also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for \u201clighter\u201d esters such as DMP and DEP. Fig. 1 shows the relative extraction efficiency of the PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre in the temperature range of 40 and 100 \u00b0C. While the amount of \u201cheavier\u201d phthalate esters being collected on the fibre was proportional to the sample temperature, the extracted amount of DMP and DEP reached a maximum at around 70 \u00b0C and then decreased with further increases of sample temperature. The upper bound of the extraction temperature was also limited by the milk matrix as the proteins and other biological components could become clustered if the sample temperature was too high, thereby affecting the effectiveness of the stirring. To balance the extraction efficiency for all targets, a 90 \u00b0C sample temperature was selected.\nThe effects of extraction time on the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre were illustrated in Fig. 2 . The extraction efficiency of PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre reached a plateau within 60 min for most phthalate esters, except for BBP. This time was longer than 40 min required for the direct SPME extraction of phthalate esters in water , reflecting the time needed for the analytes to be released from milk matrix into the headspace and diffusion of analytes from headspace into the fibre.\nSodium chloride was added to saturate the milk sample (about 2.5 for 5 g of milk sample) to improve extraction efficiency of the phthalate esters, as addition of salt can result in enhanced ion strength in the sample matrix and in increased vapour pressure in the headspace . Compared to without salt, the extraction efficiency with a salt saturated milk sample was improved for all the phthalate esters as shown Fig. 3 . The largest improvement was for DBP (six times).\nAt the completion of HS-SPME extraction, the fibre was immediately analyzed by GC/MS. The GC desorption temperature was set at the upper limit (280 \u00b0C) of the fibre due to the semi-volatile nature of the phthalate esters. Various desorption times were studied to evaluate the completeness of desorbing phthalate esters from the fibre. The first four \u201clighter\u201d esters (DMP, DEP, DBP and BBP) could be desorbed with 99% completeness within 5 min. Greater than 99% desorption completeness for all phthalate esters was achieved in 10 min desorption time (99.9% for DMP, 99.8% for DEP, 99.8% for DBP, 99.7% for BBP, 99.1% for DEHP and 99.3% for DOP). The GC purge gas valve was kept closed so that the majority of desorbed analytes could enter the GC column. Once the desorption time of 10 min was reached, the GC purge valve was turned on and the fibre remained in the injection port at 280 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min. In this way, the remaining trace residues of the analytes could be cleaned with the large portion (98%) of the desorption stream bypassing the GC/column. The fibre was ready afterwards for the next SPME sample extraction.\nIt was observed that the absolute extraction efficiency (AEE) (defined as the percentage of the amount collected on the fibre compared to the amount spiked in the milk sample) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples. To evaluate the effect of fat concentration, milk samples containing various amount of fat were spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each of the phthalate esters. The inverse relationship of AEE and fat content was best described by power law equations when the data from the milk sample containing 0% fat were excluded. The best curve fitting equations for all phthalate esters were listed in the caption of Fig. 4 . The AEE of phthalate esters in milk samples was lower than that from direct SPME in water samples , especially for samples containing high fat content. For example, the AEE was in the range of 2.9% (0% fat samples) and 0.27% (10.8% fat sample) for DEHP. Due to this low absolute extraction efficiency, it is very important to have the internal standards to correct for the extraction efficiency. In this study, DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 were chosen as internal standards.\nSince the AEEs of phthalate esters in the milk samples were dependent on the fat content in the milk, each milk sample therefore has to be considered a unique matrix. To address this matrix effect, the first step was to use the standard addition method to evaluate whether the relative response factor (RRF) was independent of the phthalate concentration in the sample of a given matrix. The RRF of the target analyte to the internal standard can be defined as follows: RRF=As\u00d7CisAis\u00d7Cs where A s is the peak area of the analyte, C is the concentration of the internal standard, A is the peak area of the internal standard and C s is the concentration of the analyte.\nThe range of standard addition was from 0.01 \u03bcg to 0.8 \u03bcg g\u22121 of milk sample. It was observed that RRF of an analyte remained the same for a given milk sample and there was little variation among samples with different fat content. An example of such RRFs is given in Table 2 , where typical RRFs of DEHP with various fat concentrations in milk samples are summarized. The RRFs of DEHP were constant over the concentration range for each of the sample matrices as evident by the small standard deviation (S.D.) in each sample matrix. Furthermore, the fat content ranged from 2 to 10.8 % has little effects on the RRFs, which was at 1.00 \u00b1 0.05.\nSince the RRF remained constant in a given matrix, it is possible to use one-point standard addition (unspiked sample plus one spiking level) to calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Thus for spiked sample, the RRF can be calculated as follows: RRF=Asp\u00d7CisspAissp\u00d7(Csp+Cs) where A sp is the peak area of the target analyte in the spiked sample, C issp the concentration of internal standard in the spiked sample, which is equal to C is in the unspiked sample, A issp the peak area of the internal standard in the spiked sample and (C sp + C s) is the sum of the spiking level (C sp) and the concentration of the target analyte (C s).\nSince the RRF is independent of the concentration in the samples and C issp is the same as C is, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be combined to form Eq. (3) for calculating the concentration of the target analyte (C s) in the sample. Cs=As\u00d7Csp(Asp\u00d7Ais/Aissp\u2212As)\nThe detection limit (DL) was estimated using two different approaches. For analytes (DMP, DEP, BBP and DOP) that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre, the DL was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3. For analytes (DBP and DEHP) that had detectable background levels, the DL was estimated at three times the standard deviation of the fibre blank plus the mean level in the fibre blanks (n = 27) through the study (Table 3 ). Among all phthalate esters, DEHP had the highest detection limit of 45 pg due to its high background level in the fibre. The relatively high background level of DEHP in the fibre blanks was most likely due to the ubiquitous presence of DEHP in the environment including laboratory air, as DEHP is the most widely used plasticizer present in a variety of soft plastics . The utmost care was taken to minimize the levels in the analytical system including rigorous cleaning of the fibre between samples.\nSince the AEE of phthalate esters (Fig. 4) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples, the method detection limit (MDL) must be calculated by dividing the DL by the AEE. The best curve fitting equations for all the phthalate esters listed in Fig. 4 were used to calculate the AEE at a given fat content, except for 0% fat samples, whose direct measured values were used. For example, the MDL for DEHP varied from 0.31 ng g\u22121 in 0% fat samples to 3.3 ng g\u22121 in 10.8% fat samples. This range of MDL was lower than MDLs from solvent extraction or SPE method, which were reported to be above 10 ng g\u22121 for milk samples .\nThe accuracy for the determination of phthalate esters in milk samples was evaluated at two spiking levels of 500 and 2000 ng in 5 g of the homogenized milk, respectively, with seven replicates for each level. When subtracted by the levels in homogenized milk, the accuracy at both spiking levels was between 90 and 104%, except for DMP at the lower spiking level (82%). The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values in this case were around 10% for both spiking levels (Table 3).\nIn the modern dairy farm, milking is done entirely by machine systems employing flexible tubing of various polymers. Concerns of potential migration of DEHP from plasticized PVC milking tubing to raw milk have been raised in the overall strategy of reducing human exposure to DEHP. Using the method described above, milk samples from six cows in a dairy farm were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the typical selected ion (m/z 149) chromatograms of the cow milk samples, the top one is a teat sample and the bottom one is the line sample of the same cow. DMP was monitored by the target ion of m/z 163. Since no DMP was detected in any of the samples, the ion of 163 was not shown in Fig. 5. For each cow, the milk was collected by hand milking (coded as teat sample) followed by machine milking with plasticized PVC tubing (coded as line sample). All milk samples were collected in duplicate. The duplicate results, expressed in mean value and percentage of difference between the duplicate, indicate the repeatability of the method.\nThe summary results of phthalate esters in six cow milks are summarized in Table 4 . On a per-weight basis, DEHP levels in line samples (111.67\u2013282.90 ng g\u22121), were 10\u201320 times higher than the teat samples (8.40\u201323.72 ng g\u22121), while the levels of the other two detected phthalate esters (DEP and DBP) were very similar between the two groups of samples. This clearly demonstrated the migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into the raw milk during milk collection. Analysis of the PVC tubing material, which was used for collecting the test milk samples, indicated that the tubing contained 28% by weight of DEHP. DEHP concentrations in commercial milks containing up to 3% fat were reported in the range of 50\u2013130 ng g\u22121, except for one sample (380 ng g\u22121) . The levels of DEHP in the teat samples, where the raw milk did not come in contact with PVC tubing, were about 10 times above the detection limit (Table 3).\nBesides DEHP, the method was sufficiently sensitive to detect the levels of DBP and DEP in the collected cow milks. DBP was detected in all samples with concentration levels around 4\u201310 ng g\u22121, which was at least 10 times above the detection limit listed in Table 3. Levels of DEP in cow milk were found in the range of 0.5\u20131 ng g\u22121, which were above the detection limits as well. The other remaining three phthalate esters were not detected in these milk samples.\nThe HS-SPME method described in this paper is sensitive enough to measure the levels of phthalate esters in milk samples directly collected from a dairy farm. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported. The method also avoids the solvent-consuming cleaning procedures of the solvent extraction method, which are used to remove fat present in milk samples. A combined standard addition and internal standard approach eliminates the matrix effect primarily attributed to the fat content in milk samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported analytical method using HS-SPME technique for the measurements of phthalate esters in milk samples.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

Extensive use of these chemicals resulted in their presence in various environmental matrices such as water, soil and food, including milk and other dairy products . Phthalate esters have endocrine disrupting properties . Studies have shown that phthalate esters are estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals . Because of the potential health impact on humans, the European Commission, for example, is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys .\nAmong all phthalate esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used plasticizer worldwide. DEHP is released to the environment through volatilization and leaching from plastics and other sources. Its widespread usage coupled with its persistence in the environment result in its ubiquitous presence in the environment and in biota including humans . DEHP levels in Danish retail whole milk samples were found at up to 0.14 mg kg\u22121 . A surveillance work on phthalate esters in Canadian dairy products and margarine has shown that the levels of DEHP and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) were up to 11.9 and 47.8 mg kg\u22121, respectively . Although Government of Canada does not have an permissible level of phthalates in milk or dairy products, it has recommended a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 44 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 for DEHP, in an assessment report in 1994 where the exposure of Canadians to DEHP from all sources was estimated at 5\u201319 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 depending on their age .\nSeveral analytical methods have been developed for determining phthalate esters in food samples . The most widely used approaches in sample preparation were liquid\u2013liquid solvent extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) . One of the drawbacks of using solvent in the sample preparation is that residues of phthalate esters, especially DEHP, are also found in solvents. Furthermore, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis by instrument analysis .\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) was introduced by Pawliszyn and Pawliszyn and Arthur in the early 1990s. In SPME, the extraction of target analytes from sample matrix to the fibre is conducted either directly, with the coated fibre directly immersed in the liquid sample (direct SPME), or in the headspace (HS-SPME), where the extracting fibre is suspended above the sample. Although suitable for the analysis of phthalate esters in water , sediments and sludge , the direct SPME method cannot be applied to complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products which often contain fat and other biological components.\nThe advantage of HS approach is the elimination of co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. Therefore, HS-SPME could be a potentially useful tool to selectively extract the phthalate esters, as the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix. However, thus far, HS-SPME has only been tested in the determination of phthalate esters in water . The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a HS-SPME based method to eliminate the fat removing procedure in the cow milk sample preparation prior to phthalate esters analysis with GC-MS (single ion monitoring, SIM) and (2) to apply this method to measure the levels of phthalate ester in milk samples collected at a dairy farm.\nA standard stock solution containing six phthalate esters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), in hexane at a level of 2000 ng \u03bcL\u22121 per compound was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 (100 ng \u03bcL\u22121) in nonane, used as internal standards in this study, were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). Dichloromethane (DCM) (GC Resolv Grade) was from Fisher Scientific (NJ, USA). Two secondary stock solutions (20 and 200 ng \u03bcL\u22121) and calibration standard solutions (0.1, 0.4, 1, 5 and 10 ng \u03bcL\u22121) were prepared by serial dilution in DCM using volumetric flasks. DBP-d4 and DEPH-d4 solution (20 ng \u03bcL\u22121) was prepared in the similar manner. Calibration standard solutions were spiked with DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 at a concentration level of 1 ng \u03bcL\u22121.\nSPME fibre holder and 10 different types of SPME fibres (see Table 1 ) were obtained from Supelco. Fifteen millilitres SPME clear vials with PTFE/Silicone lined screw top cap were also from Supelco. A VWR 575 Digital Hotplate and stirrers were from VWR International Ltd. (Mississauga, Ont., Canada). Vacuum pump fluid used for the heating bath was from Inland Vacuum Industries, Inc. (Churchville, NY, USA).\nFive grams of cow milk was weighed into a 15 mL SPME vial using a pipette. A magnetic stirring bar and 2.5 g of sodium chloride were added into the vial afterwards and the vial was then closed with the vial cap. The vial was tightly closed to avoid possible leakage of gas when the vial was heated. Then the vial was placed into a preheated oil bath (90 \u00b0C) on a hot plate. The stirring speed was adjusted to make the solution well stirred. After 2 min, the SPME needle then was punched through the cap into the headspace of the vial and the fibre was pushed out from the protection needle to start the sampling in the headspace. The SPME holder should be placed at a height that could result in the tip of the inserted fibre to be suspended about 1.5 cm above the milk sample. After the sampling was finished, the fibre was retracted into the protection needle. The needle was then removed from the sampling vial and inserted into a clean vial to protect the fibre from exposing to laboratory air. The needle was then immediately inserted into the GC injection port for GC/-MS analysis.\nA Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph (GC, HP 5890 series) coupled with a mass selective detector (MS, HP 5972 series) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for the analysis. The injection port was fitted with a SPME inlet guide (Supelco, Cat. No. 57356-U) and a pre-drilled Thermogreen LB-2 septa (Supelco, Cat. No. 23168) to secure the SPME fibre holder (Supelco, Cat. No. 57330-U). A special inlet liner for SPME used in this study was also from Supelco (Cat. No. 26375,05). The desorption of SPME fibre in the GC injection port was 10 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas off. After sample desorption, the fibre was further heated in the injection port for an additional 30 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas turned on to remove trace residues in the fibre while desorbed phthalate esters were being analyzed, before the next extraction. The fibre was then retracted into the protection needle and the needle was inserted into a clean vial, ready for the next sample extraction.\nAnalytes were separated on a 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness DB-5 gas chromatographic column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) with the following oven temperature program: the initial temperature was set at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, increased to 280 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C per minute and kept at 280 \u00b0C for 15 min.\nSelected ion monitoring mode was used for MS operation. Three ions (the first one being the target ion (T) and rest two the qualifying ions (Q1 and Q2)) were selected for each target compound. They were: m/z 163, 77 and 194 for DMP; m/z 149, 177 and 104 for DEP; m/z 149, 223 and 104 for DBP; m/z 149, 91 and 206 for BBP; m/z 149, 167 and 279 for DEHP; and m/z 149, 279 and 104 for DOP. One ion (m/z 153) was used for the quantification of both DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4. All peak area counts of the chromatograms were normalized against the internal standard DBP-d4 (for DMP, DEP and DBP, respectively) and DEHP-d4 (for BBP, DEHP and DOP, respectively) before data reduction. Each peak was manually checked by a qualified chemist for the identity and proper integration. However, a peak must have its retention time was within 1% and at least one of its two ion ratios (Q1/T or Q2/T) within \u00b130% of those of the associated standards to be considered positive.\nPhthalate esters are semi-volatile organic chemicals with vapour pressure ranging from 3.07 \u00d7 10\u22123 mmHg for DMP to 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22128 mmHg for DEHP (Table 1) . The low vapour pressure means that the concentration of phthalate esters in the headspace of SPME vials would be very low. On the other hand, direct SPME would not be appropriate due to the presence of fat and other biological components in the milk sample matrix. The development of the HS-SPME method was therefore focused on finding a proper extraction fibre and optimizing the extraction conditions such as extraction time and temperature.\nCommercially available SPME fibres for SPME can be divided into absorbent-type and adsorbent-type. Absorption type coating is a liquid film, which cross-linked to the silica rod, while adsorbent type fibres are solid particles with pores on the surface. The extraction of absorbent-type fibres is based on partitioning of analytes into a \u2018liquid-like\u2019 phase. In the case of adsorbent type fibres the particle surface interacts physically with the analytes . A total of 10 commercially available fibres with different coating materials and coating thickness (Table 1) were evaluated for their applicability to extract phthalate esters from milk samples. A commercial Homo-milk (3.25% fat) (spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each phthalate ester in 5 g milk) was used in the experiment. Table 1 summarizes the relative amount of phthalate esters collected on each fibre (normalized to the highest extracted amount among all phthalate esters) under the sample extraction condition of 90 \u00b0C for 60 min (see Section 3.2). Comparison of fibres for their extraction efficiency was also conducted at 50 \u00b0C. However, the overall amount of phthalate esters being collected was too low to be used for the purpose of selecting fibres, compared to the results obtained at 90 \u00b0C. For DMP and DEP, PDMS/DVB-StablFlex-65 \u03bcm and DVB/CAR/PDMS-50/30 \u03bcm fibres had the best results. However, for the rest of the phthalate esters listed in Table 1, PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre, a fused silica rod coated with a liquid film of cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane, had the best extraction efficiency. The ability of the coating phase to retain the analyte was also dependent on the coating thickness and the molecular weight of the analytes. It was observed that at the extraction temperature of 90 \u00b0C the extraction efficiency of the PDMS coated fibres for phthalate esters, except for DMP and DEP, was drastically reduced when the thickness of the coating was reduced from 100 to 30 \u03bcm and 7 \u03bcm. Such film thickness effects on extraction efficiency were however, not evident in the direct SPME of phthalate esters in water which was conducted at 25 \u00b0C . Such film thickness dependent extraction efficiency in headspace SPME in the case of higher molecular weight phthalate esters could be attributed to the retaining capacity of the film. The larger the liquid volume is, the more capacity of holding-back the phthalate esters the fibre possesses. For lower molecular weight phthalate esters, the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium dominates the extraction process and therefore the effects of film thickness are not significant.\nAlthough PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre had lower extraction efficiency for DMP and DEP. It was still selected as the extraction fibre for this study since DEHP and DBP are the two major phthalate esters detected in dairy products including milk . In addition, DEHP is the most important analyte in this study to achieve the objective of assessing potential migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into milk samples during milking.\nTo compensate for the low vapour pressures of phthalate esters, a high extraction temperature is desirable to accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase the concentration of the esters in the headspace. There are two governing equilibriums (gas phase \u2194 sample matrix and gas phase \u2194 liquid coating of the fibre) in HS-SPME. The high temperature would increase the concentration in the gas phase, however, it also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for \u201clighter\u201d esters such as DMP and DEP. Fig. 1 shows the relative extraction efficiency of the PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre in the temperature range of 40 and 100 \u00b0C. While the amount of \u201cheavier\u201d phthalate esters being collected on the fibre was proportional to the sample temperature, the extracted amount of DMP and DEP reached a maximum at around 70 \u00b0C and then decreased with further increases of sample temperature. The upper bound of the extraction temperature was also limited by the milk matrix as the proteins and other biological components could become clustered if the sample temperature was too high, thereby affecting the effectiveness of the stirring. To balance the extraction efficiency for all targets, a 90 \u00b0C sample temperature was selected.\nThe effects of extraction time on the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre were illustrated in Fig. 2 . The extraction efficiency of PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre reached a plateau within 60 min for most phthalate esters, except for BBP. This time was longer than 40 min required for the direct SPME extraction of phthalate esters in water , reflecting the time needed for the analytes to be released from milk matrix into the headspace and diffusion of analytes from headspace into the fibre.\nSodium chloride was added to saturate the milk sample (about 2.5 for 5 g of milk sample) to improve extraction efficiency of the phthalate esters, as addition of salt can result in enhanced ion strength in the sample matrix and in increased vapour pressure in the headspace . Compared to without salt, the extraction efficiency with a salt saturated milk sample was improved for all the phthalate esters as shown Fig. 3 . The largest improvement was for DBP (six times).\nAt the completion of HS-SPME extraction, the fibre was immediately analyzed by GC/MS. The GC desorption temperature was set at the upper limit (280 \u00b0C) of the fibre due to the semi-volatile nature of the phthalate esters. Various desorption times were studied to evaluate the completeness of desorbing phthalate esters from the fibre. The first four \u201clighter\u201d esters (DMP, DEP, DBP and BBP) could be desorbed with 99% completeness within 5 min. Greater than 99% desorption completeness for all phthalate esters was achieved in 10 min desorption time (99.9% for DMP, 99.8% for DEP, 99.8% for DBP, 99.7% for BBP, 99.1% for DEHP and 99.3% for DOP). The GC purge gas valve was kept closed so that the majority of desorbed analytes could enter the GC column. Once the desorption time of 10 min was reached, the GC purge valve was turned on and the fibre remained in the injection port at 280 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min. In this way, the remaining trace residues of the analytes could be cleaned with the large portion (98%) of the desorption stream bypassing the GC/column. The fibre was ready afterwards for the next SPME sample extraction.\nIt was observed that the absolute extraction efficiency (AEE) (defined as the percentage of the amount collected on the fibre compared to the amount spiked in the milk sample) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples. To evaluate the effect of fat concentration, milk samples containing various amount of fat were spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each of the phthalate esters. The inverse relationship of AEE and fat content was best described by power law equations when the data from the milk sample containing 0% fat were excluded. The best curve fitting equations for all phthalate esters were listed in the caption of Fig. 4 . The AEE of phthalate esters in milk samples was lower than that from direct SPME in water samples , especially for samples containing high fat content. For example, the AEE was in the range of 2.9% (0% fat samples) and 0.27% (10.8% fat sample) for DEHP. Due to this low absolute extraction efficiency, it is very important to have the internal standards to correct for the extraction efficiency. In this study, DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 were chosen as internal standards.\nSince the AEEs of phthalate esters in the milk samples were dependent on the fat content in the milk, each milk sample therefore has to be considered a unique matrix. To address this matrix effect, the first step was to use the standard addition method to evaluate whether the relative response factor (RRF) was independent of the phthalate concentration in the sample of a given matrix. The RRF of the target analyte to the internal standard can be defined as follows: RRF=As\u00d7CisAis\u00d7Cs where A s is the peak area of the analyte, C is the concentration of the internal standard, A is the peak area of the internal standard and C s is the concentration of the analyte.\nThe range of standard addition was from 0.01 \u03bcg to 0.8 \u03bcg g\u22121 of milk sample. It was observed that RRF of an analyte remained the same for a given milk sample and there was little variation among samples with different fat content. An example of such RRFs is given in Table 2 , where typical RRFs of DEHP with various fat concentrations in milk samples are summarized. The RRFs of DEHP were constant over the concentration range for each of the sample matrices as evident by the small standard deviation (S.D.) in each sample matrix. Furthermore, the fat content ranged from 2 to 10.8 % has little effects on the RRFs, which was at 1.00 \u00b1 0.05.\nSince the RRF remained constant in a given matrix, it is possible to use one-point standard addition (unspiked sample plus one spiking level) to calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Thus for spiked sample, the RRF can be calculated as follows: RRF=Asp\u00d7CisspAissp\u00d7(Csp+Cs) where A sp is the peak area of the target analyte in the spiked sample, C issp the concentration of internal standard in the spiked sample, which is equal to C is in the unspiked sample, A issp the peak area of the internal standard in the spiked sample and (C sp + C s) is the sum of the spiking level (C sp) and the concentration of the target analyte (C s).\nSince the RRF is independent of the concentration in the samples and C issp is the same as C is, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be combined to form Eq. (3) for calculating the concentration of the target analyte (C s) in the sample. Cs=As\u00d7Csp(Asp\u00d7Ais/Aissp\u2212As)\nThe detection limit (DL) was estimated using two different approaches. For analytes (DMP, DEP, BBP and DOP) that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre, the DL was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3. For analytes (DBP and DEHP) that had detectable background levels, the DL was estimated at three times the standard deviation of the fibre blank plus the mean level in the fibre blanks (n = 27) through the study (Table 3 ). Among all phthalate esters, DEHP had the highest detection limit of 45 pg due to its high background level in the fibre. The relatively high background level of DEHP in the fibre blanks was most likely due to the ubiquitous presence of DEHP in the environment including laboratory air, as DEHP is the most widely used plasticizer present in a variety of soft plastics . The utmost care was taken to minimize the levels in the analytical system including rigorous cleaning of the fibre between samples.\nSince the AEE of phthalate esters (Fig. 4) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples, the method detection limit (MDL) must be calculated by dividing the DL by the AEE. The best curve fitting equations for all the phthalate esters listed in Fig. 4 were used to calculate the AEE at a given fat content, except for 0% fat samples, whose direct measured values were used. For example, the MDL for DEHP varied from 0.31 ng g\u22121 in 0% fat samples to 3.3 ng g\u22121 in 10.8% fat samples. This range of MDL was lower than MDLs from solvent extraction or SPE method, which were reported to be above 10 ng g\u22121 for milk samples .\nThe accuracy for the determination of phthalate esters in milk samples was evaluated at two spiking levels of 500 and 2000 ng in 5 g of the homogenized milk, respectively, with seven replicates for each level. When subtracted by the levels in homogenized milk, the accuracy at both spiking levels was between 90 and 104%, except for DMP at the lower spiking level (82%). The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values in this case were around 10% for both spiking levels (Table 3).\nIn the modern dairy farm, milking is done entirely by machine systems employing flexible tubing of various polymers. Concerns of potential migration of DEHP from plasticized PVC milking tubing to raw milk have been raised in the overall strategy of reducing human exposure to DEHP. Using the method described above, milk samples from six cows in a dairy farm were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the typical selected ion (m/z 149) chromatograms of the cow milk samples, the top one is a teat sample and the bottom one is the line sample of the same cow. DMP was monitored by the target ion of m/z 163. Since no DMP was detected in any of the samples, the ion of 163 was not shown in Fig. 5. For each cow, the milk was collected by hand milking (coded as teat sample) followed by machine milking with plasticized PVC tubing (coded as line sample). All milk samples were collected in duplicate. The duplicate results, expressed in mean value and percentage of difference between the duplicate, indicate the repeatability of the method.\nThe summary results of phthalate esters in six cow milks are summarized in Table 4 . On a per-weight basis, DEHP levels in line samples (111.67\u2013282.90 ng g\u22121), were 10\u201320 times higher than the teat samples (8.40\u201323.72 ng g\u22121), while the levels of the other two detected phthalate esters (DEP and DBP) were very similar between the two groups of samples. This clearly demonstrated the migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into the raw milk during milk collection. Analysis of the PVC tubing material, which was used for collecting the test milk samples, indicated that the tubing contained 28% by weight of DEHP. DEHP concentrations in commercial milks containing up to 3% fat were reported in the range of 50\u2013130 ng g\u22121, except for one sample (380 ng g\u22121) . The levels of DEHP in the teat samples, where the raw milk did not come in contact with PVC tubing, were about 10 times above the detection limit (Table 3).\nBesides DEHP, the method was sufficiently sensitive to detect the levels of DBP and DEP in the collected cow milks. DBP was detected in all samples with concentration levels around 4\u201310 ng g\u22121, which was at least 10 times above the detection limit listed in Table 3. Levels of DEP in cow milk were found in the range of 0.5\u20131 ng g\u22121, which were above the detection limits as well. The other remaining three phthalate esters were not detected in these milk samples.\nThe HS-SPME method described in this paper is sensitive enough to measure the levels of phthalate esters in milk samples directly collected from a dairy farm. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported. The method also avoids the solvent-consuming cleaning procedures of the solvent extraction method, which are used to remove fat present in milk samples. A combined standard addition and internal standard approach eliminates the matrix effect primarily attributed to the fat content in milk samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported analytical method using HS-SPME technique for the measurements of phthalate esters in milk samples."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nOver the last few years, molecular imprinting technique has received considerable attention in the fields of polymer science and chemical analysis, owing to its predetermined selectivity for target molecular, high affinity and robustness . Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules and cross-linking agent by covalent , non-covalent and sacrificial spacer methods . Binding sites with molecular recognition properties are formed after template molecules are removed from the polymerized material, leaving behind cavities complementary in size and shape to the template for the subsequent rebinding process. MIPs have been extensively used in several applications such as solid phase extraction (SPE) , chromatographic separation , catalysis facilitation and artificial reception .\nIn recent years, MIPs have been gained wide acceptance as new molecular recognition materials in chemical sensors, since they are more stable, less costly and easier to produce as compared to their biological counterparts including antibodies and enzymes . Various chemical sensors have been prepared using MIPs for molecular recognition followed by appropriate signal transductions including capacitance , conductometry , amperometry , voltammetry , quartz microbalance and spectroscopy . Potentiometric sensors are generic and highly successful approaches to chemical sensing, and MIP based potentiometric sensors have shown to be very promising . Unlike sensors based other transduction techniques, potentiometric sensors do not require the template molecules to diffuse through the electrode membranes for generation of membrane potentials , thus dramatically reducing the response time. However, reports on MIP based potentiometric sensors are still rather rare .\nMelamine, 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, slightly soluble in water, is a common organic compound that is often used with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a synthetic polymer as fire resistant and heat tolerant . Melamine became a topic of much discussion in early 2007, when veterinary scientists determined it to be the cause of hundreds of pet deaths due to pet food contamination. Especially, the 2008 melamine-tainted-milk powder incident in China led to serious concern about melamine for food safety. Consequently, several methods have been developed for melamine detection in food, such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry , solid phase extraction , ultraviolet spectrum, Raman spectroscopy and ion chromatography . However, these methods require expensive apparatus and complicated pretreatment. Since potentiometric technique allows sensitive, simple and inexpensive detection of analyte, it would be a promising alternative for melamine analysis in food samples. In this paper, a polymeric membrane ion-selective electrode (ISE) based on MIP is described for the determination of melamine in milk. Melamine is a weak base with a pK a of 5.05, and is readily protonated in aqueous solution at pHs lower than 5.0. The protonated melamine can thus be measured potentiometrically by the ISE. Interference from high concentrations of ions co-existing in milk such as K+ and Na+ can be effectively eliminated by on-line introduction of anion and cation-exchanger tandem columns placed upstream. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first sensing system for rapid determination of melamine.\nMelamine, methacrylic acid (MAA), benzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrle (AIBN), 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE), bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), sodium tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl]borate (NaTFPB) and high molecular weight poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 732 strong-acid cation-exchange resin and 717 strong-base anion-exchange resin were obtained from Guoyao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for sample separation. Aqueous solutions were prepared with freshly de-ionized water (18.2 M\u03a9 cm specific resistance) obtained with a Pall Cascada laboratory water system. A stock solution of 0.01 M melamine was made by dissolving 1.261 g of melamine in 1 L of 0.05 M acetic acid solution. MAA, EGDMA, benzene and THF were distilled in vacuum prior to use. All other reagents were analytical grade and used without any further purification.\nThe schematic representation of the non-covalent imprinting process and removal of template is shown in Fig. 1 . The MIP was prepared by the non-covalent method. Firstly, pre-complexation was obtained by mixing melamine (0.2 mmol) template and MAA (0.8 mmol) functional monomer with benzene (100 mL) in a 250 mL flask and sonicating for 10 min to maintain homogeneity. Secondly, EGDMA (2.4 mmol) and AIBN (1 mmol) were dropped into the flask as a cross-linker and an initiator, respectively, and then the resulting mixture was purged with N2 for 5 min and sonicated for 10 min. Lastly, the flask was sealed under N2 atmosphere and placed in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C for 17 h for polymerization. The produced polymer was crushed, grounded and sieved to particle sizes ranging from 50 to 150 \u03bcm. Removal of the template and unreacted monomers was done by washing the polymer successively in methanol/acetic acid solution (8:2, v/v) for three times, each time for 3 h, and then twice in 70 \u00b0C de-ionized water for 2 h. The recycle time (\u223c6 times) for washing process was finished until no absorption of the de-ionized water at 235 nm was observed with a Beckman DU-800 UV spectrophotometer. The non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized by the similar procedure in the absence of template molecules.\nMembrane contained (in wt%) MIP or NIP (6.1), NaTFPB (1.5), NPOE (61.1), and PVC (31.3). The components of each membrane (totaling 360 mg) were dissolved in THF (3.5 mL) and poured into a glass ring (i.d. 36 mm) fixed on a glass plate. Overnight evaporation of the solvent yields membranes of \u223c200 \u03bcm. For each electrode, a disk of 9-mm diameter was punched from the membranes and glued to a plasticized PVC tubing with THF/PVC slurry. For measurement of melamine, the internal filling and conditioning medium were 10\u22124 mol L\u22121 melamine in 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7, while for measurement of experimental selectivity coefficients, 0.01 M NaCl was used as the internal filling and conditioning medium. All the electrodes were conditioned for one day before measurement.\n1.5 g of 717-type anion-exchanger resin and that of 732-type cation-exchanger resin were treated with 25 mL of 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl, respectively, equilibrating for 12 h under constant agitation. The resulting 717 hydroxide-form anion-exchanger resin and 732 hydrogen-form cation-exchanger resin were washed with de-ionized water and then packed separately in a 10-cm length of glass column (5.0 mm i.d.) and furnished with glass wool at both ends to retain the resins. The two columns were tandem connected for sample separation.\nPrior to sample analysis, 10 mL of ethanol was added into the same amount of milk sample. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through a standard 0.45 \u03bcm filter in order to remove the proteins which might interfere with the measurement probably due to its adsorption on the surface of membrane electrode, as reported by Ramamurthy et al. .\nAll measurements of emf were performed at 20\u201321 \u00b0C using a PXSJ-216L pH meter (Leici, Shanghai) with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode in the galvanic cell: SCE//sample solution/ISE membrane/inner filling solution/3 M KCl/AgCl/Ag. Melamine standards were prepared by consecutively diluting 0.01 M of melamine with 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7. Selectivity coefficients were determined by the separate solution method in metal chloride solutions. The activity coefficient of ions, \u03b3, was calculated from the modified Debye-H\u00fckel equation: log\u03b3=\u22120.511z2\u03bc1+1.5\u03bc\u22120.2\u03bc where \u03bc is the ionic strength and z is the valence of the concerned ion.\nThe apparatus manifold employed is shown in Fig. 2 . The sample stream was delivered by one peristaltic pump (IFIS-D, Xi\u2019an Remex Analyse Instrument Co., Ltd.) to flow through the ion-exchanger resin columns at a relatively low flow rate of 0.5 mL min\u22121 for efficient removal of interfering ions co-existing in milk. The de-ionized sample solution was merged at a Y-joint with 0.02 M acetate buffer solution of pH 3.7 delivered by another peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min\u22121 to produce protonated melamine, which was then measured by the MIP based ISE placed in a flow cell (200 \u03bcl). PTFE tubing (0.8 mm i.d.) was used throughout the procedure to connect all components in the flow system.\nThe influence of membrane composition on the potential response was tested and the results are shown in Table 1 . Since the plasticizer/PVC ratio of about two results in suitable performance characteristics , this ratio was kept constant in the optimization of membrane composition. It was found that the membrane with NPOE provided a better response with a wider linear response range (5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) compared to those with DOS (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) and DOP (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M). Since lipophilic salts or ionic additives can decrease the membrane resistance, reduce anion interference and improve selectivity of the electrode , NaTFPB was incorporated in the membrane. Experiments show that the response slope of the MIP based membrane can be improved to be nearly theoretical with the lipophilic borate. The sensitivity and linearity for the membrane electrode also depends on the amount of MIP which determines the number of the binding sites. It can be seen that the potential sensitivity increases upon increasing the amount of MIP. However, at amounts above 6.1 wt%, MIP becomes insoluble in the membrane which may cause low electrical conductivity and poor sensor response. Table 1 indicates that the membrane with 31.3 wt% of PVC, 61.1 wt% of NPOE, 1.5 wt% of borate and 6.1 wt% of MIP shows the best performance.\nDegree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during polymerization process, which is essential for the formation of binding sites. The stable shape of complementary cavity for imprinted process cannot be maintained with low degree of cross-linking. However, high degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removal of template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent . To choose a suitable degree of cross-linking for polymerization process, the effect of the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer was investigated in the range of 1\u20135. Fig. 3 shows that the variation of degree of cross-linking exhibits a significant difference in the potential response, and the mole ratio of 3 gives the best response in terms of wider linear range and lower detection limit.\nThe influence of sample pH on the potential response of MIP based melamine ISE was tested with melamine of 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 M in the pH range of 1.5\u20137.0. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the potential response is nearly constant in the pH range of 3.0\u20134.5, but potential decreases appear at pHs beyond this range. This is probably due to the fact that at pH > 4.5, melamine mainly exists as a neutral molecule which shows no potential response at ISE; but at pH < 3, melamine can be hydrolyzed and converted to other species such as ammeline and cyanuric acid , which leads to the decrease of the amount of protonated melamine ions.\nThe potential response curves of MIP- and NIP-based membranes and the blank membrane (only with borate) are shown in Fig. 5 . The MIP based membrane shows a near-Nernstian response of 54.1 mV/decade over the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 with a detection limit of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121. However, the NIP-based and blank membranes exhibit a near-Nernstian response in a rather narrow concentration range, which is probably due to the nonspecific interaction of the protonated melamine ion with the ion-exchanger in the polymeric membrane. Evidently, it can be demonstrated that the MIP is effective for specific recognition of the target ion.\nThe response time of the MIP based membrane ISE is defined as the average time required for the sensor to reach \u00b11 mV of the magnitude of the equilibrated potential signal after successively immersing in a series of melamine ion solutions, each having a 10-fold concentration difference . The dynamic potential response with time is shown in Fig. 6 , where the melamine concentration is changed between 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. It can be seen that the response of the MIP sensor is rapid (\u223c16 s) and fully reversible. Experiments also showed that no significant changes were observed in the response characteristics of the MIP-based melamine ISE after the electrode was stored in the conditioning solution for 2 months. Since ethanol is added to the sample solution for protein removal during the pretreatment procedure, the durability of the membrane electrode in ethanol solution was evaluated by measuring the response to the protonated melamine after storage in the ethanol/H2O solution (1:4, v/v) for 24 h. No loss of response was observed for the proposed electrode after this time.\nThe selectivity coefficients (KM,Xpot) for melamine (M) toward interfering ions (X) were evaluated by using the \u201cstrong interference\u201d method introduced by Bakker to eliminate the influence of the inherent sensitivity limit on the ISE response toward discriminated ions . The results of selectivity of MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions are shown in Fig. 7 . Potentiometric selectivity coefficient values for the MIP or NIP-based ISE are summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that the proposed electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the proposed MIP membrane electrode over interfering ions such as Na+ and K+ are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.\nMilk samples contain rather high concentrations of interfering ions such as \u223c10\u22122 mol L\u22121 of Na+, K+ and Ca2+, therefore it is necessary to employ the ion-exchanger resin columns in the flow system to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. Since melamine exists as neutral molecules in milk samples with a pH of \u223c6.7, it could flow through the ion-exchanger column without any loss. The effect of the ion-exchanger columns for measurement of melamine in pretreated milk samples is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the flow system with the ion-exchanger columns indeed shows a wider linearity range of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 and a lower detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121, as compared to that without the columns which suffers from serious interference problems and has a rather poor detection limit of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. Experiments also indicate that the anion-exchanger column should be placed ahead of the cation-exchanger column for the tandem sequence. Such design can avoid the formation of acid solution (pH < 3) when the sample flows through the cation-exchanger column and exchange the co-existing cations with H+ on the resins, which may cause the decomposition of melamine as discussed before. It should be noted that the response slope for measurement of protonated melamine in the pretreated milk samples (\u223c47.2 mV/decade) is a bit lower than that of the standard calibration curve (\u223c54.1 mV/decade) for measurement in buffer solution, which is probably due to the matrix effect caused by the addition of ethanol to the sample solution during the pretreatment procedure.\nThe lifetime of the ion-exchanger column was calculated by the theoretical capacities of the cation-exchanger and anion-exchanger resins (4.2 and 3.0 mequiv. g\u22121, respectively, as reported by the manufacturer). It can be estimated that the ion-exchanger column would be used for ca. 100 times.\nThe flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode was used to analyze melamine in spiked milk samples which was pretreated with protein removal. The results are given in Table 3 .

        "txt": "Over the last few years, molecular imprinting technique has received considerable attention in the fields of polymer science and chemical analysis, owing to its predetermined selectivity for target molecular, high affinity and robustness . Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules and cross-linking agent by covalent , non-covalent and sacrificial spacer methods . Binding sites with molecular recognition properties are formed after template molecules are removed from the polymerized material, leaving behind cavities complementary in size and shape to the template for the subsequent rebinding process. MIPs have been extensively used in several applications such as solid phase extraction (SPE) , chromatographic separation , catalysis facilitation and artificial reception .\nIn recent years, MIPs have been gained wide acceptance as new molecular recognition materials in chemical sensors, since they are more stable, less costly and easier to produce as compared to their biological counterparts including antibodies and enzymes . Various chemical sensors have been prepared using MIPs for molecular recognition followed by appropriate signal transductions including capacitance , conductometry , amperometry , voltammetry , quartz microbalance and spectroscopy . Potentiometric sensors are generic and highly successful approaches to chemical sensing, and MIP based potentiometric sensors have shown to be very promising . Unlike sensors based other transduction techniques, potentiometric sensors do not require the template molecules to diffuse through the electrode membranes for generation of membrane potentials , thus dramatically reducing the response time. However, reports on MIP based potentiometric sensors are still rather rare .\nMelamine, 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, slightly soluble in water, is a common organic compound that is often used with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a synthetic polymer as fire resistant and heat tolerant . Melamine became a topic of much discussion in early 2007, when veterinary scientists determined it to be the cause of hundreds of pet deaths due to pet food contamination. Especially, the 2008 melamine-tainted-milk powder incident in China led to serious concern about melamine for food safety. Consequently, several methods have been developed for melamine detection in food, such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry , solid phase extraction , ultraviolet spectrum, Raman spectroscopy and ion chromatography . However, these methods require expensive apparatus and complicated pretreatment. Since potentiometric technique allows sensitive, simple and inexpensive detection of analyte, it would be a promising alternative for melamine analysis in food samples. In this paper, a polymeric membrane ion-selective electrode (ISE) based on MIP is described for the determination of melamine in milk. Melamine is a weak base with a pK a of 5.05, and is readily protonated in aqueous solution at pHs lower than 5.0. The protonated melamine can thus be measured potentiometrically by the ISE. Interference from high concentrations of ions co-existing in milk such as K+ and Na+ can be effectively eliminated by on-line introduction of anion and cation-exchanger tandem columns placed upstream. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first sensing system for rapid determination of melamine.\nMelamine, methacrylic acid (MAA), benzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrle (AIBN), 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE), bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), sodium tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl]borate (NaTFPB) and high molecular weight poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 732 strong-acid cation-exchange resin and 717 strong-base anion-exchange resin were obtained from Guoyao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for sample separation. Aqueous solutions were prepared with freshly de-ionized water (18.2 M\u03a9 cm specific resistance) obtained with a Pall Cascada laboratory water system. A stock solution of 0.01 M melamine was made by dissolving 1.261 g of melamine in 1 L of 0.05 M acetic acid solution. MAA, EGDMA, benzene and THF were distilled in vacuum prior to use. All other reagents were analytical grade and used without any further purification.\nThe schematic representation of the non-covalent imprinting process and removal of template is shown in Fig. 1 . The MIP was prepared by the non-covalent method. Firstly, pre-complexation was obtained by mixing melamine (0.2 mmol) template and MAA (0.8 mmol) functional monomer with benzene (100 mL) in a 250 mL flask and sonicating for 10 min to maintain homogeneity. Secondly, EGDMA (2.4 mmol) and AIBN (1 mmol) were dropped into the flask as a cross-linker and an initiator, respectively, and then the resulting mixture was purged with N2 for 5 min and sonicated for 10 min. Lastly, the flask was sealed under N2 atmosphere and placed in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C for 17 h for polymerization. The produced polymer was crushed, grounded and sieved to particle sizes ranging from 50 to 150 \u03bcm. Removal of the template and unreacted monomers was done by washing the polymer successively in methanol/acetic acid solution (8:2, v/v) for three times, each time for 3 h, and then twice in 70 \u00b0C de-ionized water for 2 h. The recycle time (\u223c6 times) for washing process was finished until no absorption of the de-ionized water at 235 nm was observed with a Beckman DU-800 UV spectrophotometer. The non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized by the similar procedure in the absence of template molecules.\nMembrane contained (in wt%) MIP or NIP (6.1), NaTFPB (1.5), NPOE (61.1), and PVC (31.3). The components of each membrane (totaling 360 mg) were dissolved in THF (3.5 mL) and poured into a glass ring (i.d. 36 mm) fixed on a glass plate. Overnight evaporation of the solvent yields membranes of \u223c200 \u03bcm. For each electrode, a disk of 9-mm diameter was punched from the membranes and glued to a plasticized PVC tubing with THF/PVC slurry. For measurement of melamine, the internal filling and conditioning medium were 10\u22124 mol L\u22121 melamine in 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7, while for measurement of experimental selectivity coefficients, 0.01 M NaCl was used as the internal filling and conditioning medium. All the electrodes were conditioned for one day before measurement.\n1.5 g of 717-type anion-exchanger resin and that of 732-type cation-exchanger resin were treated with 25 mL of 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl, respectively, equilibrating for 12 h under constant agitation. The resulting 717 hydroxide-form anion-exchanger resin and 732 hydrogen-form cation-exchanger resin were washed with de-ionized water and then packed separately in a 10-cm length of glass column (5.0 mm i.d.) and furnished with glass wool at both ends to retain the resins. The two columns were tandem connected for sample separation.\nPrior to sample analysis, 10 mL of ethanol was added into the same amount of milk sample. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through a standard 0.45 \u03bcm filter in order to remove the proteins which might interfere with the measurement probably due to its adsorption on the surface of membrane electrode, as reported by Ramamurthy et al. .\nAll measurements of emf were performed at 20\u201321 \u00b0C using a PXSJ-216L pH meter (Leici, Shanghai) with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode in the galvanic cell: SCE//sample solution/ISE membrane/inner filling solution/3 M KCl/AgCl/Ag. Melamine standards were prepared by consecutively diluting 0.01 M of melamine with 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7. Selectivity coefficients were determined by the separate solution method in metal chloride solutions. The activity coefficient of ions, \u03b3, was calculated from the modified Debye-H\u00fckel equation: log\u03b3=\u22120.511z2\u03bc1+1.5\u03bc\u22120.2\u03bc where \u03bc is the ionic strength and z is the valence of the concerned ion.\nThe apparatus manifold employed is shown in Fig. 2 . The sample stream was delivered by one peristaltic pump (IFIS-D, Xi\u2019an Remex Analyse Instrument Co., Ltd.) to flow through the ion-exchanger resin columns at a relatively low flow rate of 0.5 mL min\u22121 for efficient removal of interfering ions co-existing in milk. The de-ionized sample solution was merged at a Y-joint with 0.02 M acetate buffer solution of pH 3.7 delivered by another peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min\u22121 to produce protonated melamine, which was then measured by the MIP based ISE placed in a flow cell (200 \u03bcl). PTFE tubing (0.8 mm i.d.) was used throughout the procedure to connect all components in the flow system.\nThe influence of membrane composition on the potential response was tested and the results are shown in Table 1 . Since the plasticizer/PVC ratio of about two results in suitable performance characteristics , this ratio was kept constant in the optimization of membrane composition. It was found that the membrane with NPOE provided a better response with a wider linear response range (5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) compared to those with DOS (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) and DOP (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M). Since lipophilic salts or ionic additives can decrease the membrane resistance, reduce anion interference and improve selectivity of the electrode , NaTFPB was incorporated in the membrane. Experiments show that the response slope of the MIP based membrane can be improved to be nearly theoretical with the lipophilic borate. The sensitivity and linearity for the membrane electrode also depends on the amount of MIP which determines the number of the binding sites. It can be seen that the potential sensitivity increases upon increasing the amount of MIP. However, at amounts above 6.1 wt%, MIP becomes insoluble in the membrane which may cause low electrical conductivity and poor sensor response. Table 1 indicates that the membrane with 31.3 wt% of PVC, 61.1 wt% of NPOE, 1.5 wt% of borate and 6.1 wt% of MIP shows the best performance.\nDegree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during polymerization process, which is essential for the formation of binding sites. The stable shape of complementary cavity for imprinted process cannot be maintained with low degree of cross-linking. However, high degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removal of template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent . To choose a suitable degree of cross-linking for polymerization process, the effect of the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer was investigated in the range of 1\u20135. Fig. 3 shows that the variation of degree of cross-linking exhibits a significant difference in the potential response, and the mole ratio of 3 gives the best response in terms of wider linear range and lower detection limit.\nThe influence of sample pH on the potential response of MIP based melamine ISE was tested with melamine of 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 M in the pH range of 1.5\u20137.0. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the potential response is nearly constant in the pH range of 3.0\u20134.5, but potential decreases appear at pHs beyond this range. This is probably due to the fact that at pH > 4.5, melamine mainly exists as a neutral molecule which shows no potential response at ISE; but at pH < 3, melamine can be hydrolyzed and converted to other species such as ammeline and cyanuric acid , which leads to the decrease of the amount of protonated melamine ions.\nThe potential response curves of MIP- and NIP-based membranes and the blank membrane (only with borate) are shown in Fig. 5 . The MIP based membrane shows a near-Nernstian response of 54.1 mV/decade over the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 with a detection limit of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121. However, the NIP-based and blank membranes exhibit a near-Nernstian response in a rather narrow concentration range, which is probably due to the nonspecific interaction of the protonated melamine ion with the ion-exchanger in the polymeric membrane. Evidently, it can be demonstrated that the MIP is effective for specific recognition of the target ion.\nThe response time of the MIP based membrane ISE is defined as the average time required for the sensor to reach \u00b11 mV of the magnitude of the equilibrated potential signal after successively immersing in a series of melamine ion solutions, each having a 10-fold concentration difference . The dynamic potential response with time is shown in Fig. 6 , where the melamine concentration is changed between 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. It can be seen that the response of the MIP sensor is rapid (\u223c16 s) and fully reversible. Experiments also showed that no significant changes were observed in the response characteristics of the MIP-based melamine ISE after the electrode was stored in the conditioning solution for 2 months. Since ethanol is added to the sample solution for protein removal during the pretreatment procedure, the durability of the membrane electrode in ethanol solution was evaluated by measuring the response to the protonated melamine after storage in the ethanol/H2O solution (1:4, v/v) for 24 h. No loss of response was observed for the proposed electrode after this time.\nThe selectivity coefficients (KM,Xpot) for melamine (M) toward interfering ions (X) were evaluated by using the \u201cstrong interference\u201d method introduced by Bakker to eliminate the influence of the inherent sensitivity limit on the ISE response toward discriminated ions . The results of selectivity of MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions are shown in Fig. 7 . Potentiometric selectivity coefficient values for the MIP or NIP-based ISE are summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that the proposed electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the proposed MIP membrane electrode over interfering ions such as Na+ and K+ are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.\nMilk samples contain rather high concentrations of interfering ions such as \u223c10\u22122 mol L\u22121 of Na+, K+ and Ca2+, therefore it is necessary to employ the ion-exchanger resin columns in the flow system to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. Since melamine exists as neutral molecules in milk samples with a pH of \u223c6.7, it could flow through the ion-exchanger column without any loss. The effect of the ion-exchanger columns for measurement of melamine in pretreated milk samples is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the flow system with the ion-exchanger columns indeed shows a wider linearity range of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 and a lower detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121, as compared to that without the columns which suffers from serious interference problems and has a rather poor detection limit of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. Experiments also indicate that the anion-exchanger column should be placed ahead of the cation-exchanger column for the tandem sequence. Such design can avoid the formation of acid solution (pH < 3) when the sample flows through the cation-exchanger column and exchange the co-existing cations with H+ on the resins, which may cause the decomposition of melamine as discussed before. It should be noted that the response slope for measurement of protonated melamine in the pretreated milk samples (\u223c47.2 mV/decade) is a bit lower than that of the standard calibration curve (\u223c54.1 mV/decade) for measurement in buffer solution, which is probably due to the matrix effect caused by the addition of ethanol to the sample solution during the pretreatment procedure.\nThe lifetime of the ion-exchanger column was calculated by the theoretical capacities of the cation-exchanger and anion-exchanger resins (4.2 and 3.0 mequiv. g\u22121, respectively, as reported by the manufacturer). It can be estimated that the ion-exchanger column would be used for ca. 100 times.\nThe flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode was used to analyze melamine in spiked milk samples which was pretreated with protein removal. The results are given in Table 3 . It can be seen that the recoveries of on-line analysis of milk samples vary from 95% to 110%, indicating that the proposed MIP based sensor flow system has promising feasibility for rapid determination of melamine in complex samples even in the presence of relatively high concentrations of potential interferents.\nA new polymeric membrane ion-selective electrode based on MIP for melamine has been described. Combined with flow analysis, the sensor can be used for measuring melamine in milk samples. The whole analysis including sample pretreatment takes less than 15 min and the detection limit is 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121, which satisfy the needs for on site rapid monitoring of trace melamine in milk. The flow analysis system is promising for use of detection of melamine contamination in other foods such as eggs and animal feeds."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) is a powerful technique for analyzing the spatial distribution of a wide range of biomolecules []. Phospholipids are integral structural and regulatory components of biological membranes, important in cell signaling pathways, and they serve as precursors to many active biomolecules []. Recently, analysis of phospholipids (PLs) by imaging mass spectrometry has been reported []. The study of the distribution of these biomolecules can provide critical insight into relevant biological processes in both healthy and diseased tissue samples.\nCommon methods of depositing matrix for MALDI imaging include robotic spotting [], electrospray deposition [], and spray-coating with an airbrush []. Robotic spotting usually yields high signal quality and very reproducible results, but the image resolution is limited to the size and spacing of the matrix spots. Washing the tissue with ethanol helps to prevent the spreading of the matrix spots, but such a wash cannot be used when analyzing phospholipids. Spray-coating can cause analyte delocalization if the tissue becomes too wet during the application. Also, the matrix crystal size and the homogeneity of the coating can vary significantly from operator to operator. Recently, a protocol using sublimation for matrix deposition has been reported [] that gives a homogeneous coating of matrix essential for obtaining high-resolution phospholipid images from tissue. The sublimation apparatus is relatively simple and is commercially available.\nWe describe a new procedure that involves dry-coating matrix on a tissue section using finely ground crystals of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) filtered through a 20-\u03bcm sieve. Positive ionization mode ion images were acquired at 30- to 100-\u03bcm lateral resolution using a MALDI TOF mass spectrometer. The results show that the dry matrix deposition protocol allows reproducible high-resolution phospholipid images to be obtained.\n2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) was purchased from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ, USA) and ground for 15 min using a mortar and a pestle, yielding crystals between 1 and 40 \u03bcm in diameter. The DHB solution used for the spray-coated comparison experiments was prepared at a concentration of 40 mg/mL using 1:1 ethanol:water solvent. The ethanol was HPLC grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ, USA).\nFresh frozen mouse brain samples were used for the imaging experiments. The tissue samples were cut into 12-\u03bcm-thick sagittal sections using a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S) and then thaw-mounted onto gold-coated MALDI plates. The sections were allowed to dry in a vacuum desiccator for 10 min before matrix application. A serial section was cut and mounted on a glass slide and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for anatomical visualization. A 20-\u03bcm stainless steel sieve, a full-height sieve receiving pan, and a sieve cover were purchased from Hogentogler & Co., Inc. (Columbia, MD, USA). The MALDI plate was attached to the bottom of the receiving pan with double-sided tape. A layer of the finely ground DHB was then disbursed over the sieve mesh using a small brush. The sieve was covered and shaken until a uniform DHB layer was deposited over the tissue sections. Excess matrix was removed by briefly directing a burst of clean compressed gas (MicroDuster III, CleanTex, Nanuet, NY, USA) toward the plate from a distance of 20 cm. The matrix application process was repeated three times for optimal coverage and homogeneity. The matrix coverage and crystals sizes were measured with an Olympus BX50 microscope.\nFor comparison, serial sections were prepared using a manual spray-coating technique. A TLC nebulizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ, USA) with nitrogen gas at 3 psi was used to spray-coat the tissue sections. The DHB solution was repetitively sprayed across the MALDI plate from a distance of 20 cm, allowing 45 s of drying time between the passes, until a uniform matrix coating was achieved on the tissue section.\nMouse brain tissue sections were imaged in the positive ionization mode with an UltraFlex II MALDI TOF-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in reflector mode, accumulating 150 laser shots per position at a 100-Hz laser frequency over m/z range of 420 to 1200. The dry-coated images were acquired at 100 \u00d7 100-, 40 \u00d7 50-, and 30 \u00d7 35-\u03bcm raster step sizes using the oversampling technique []. The spray-coated sections were imaged at a 100-\u03bcm step size. The laser intensity was adjusted before each imaging experiment to yield optimal results; generally, the dry-coated sections required 15\u201330% greater laser fluence than the spray-coated sections. The images were created, normalized, and visualized using FlexImaging software.\nWe have assessed the effectiveness of the solvent-free matrix dry-coating procedure for applications involving phospholipid imaging. The DHB crystal size and homogeneity of the matrix coverage were determined by optical microscopy. To control the crystal size deposited onto the tissue sections, we used a 20-\u03bcm sieve filter, resulting in a matrix coating consisting of crystals of 1\u201320 \u03bcm long. The crystal size distribution did not vary much between operators. Figure 1 shows a DHB-coated sagittal mouse brain section and an optical microscope image of the matrix coating on tissue at a magnification of \u00d74. The matrix coating is relatively uniform, with little clustering of the crystals.\nFigure 2 shows a comparison between the solvent-free matrix dry-coating technique described here and a spray-coating method on serial sagittal mouse brain sections. Both sections were imaged at 100-\u03bcm lateral resolution. The average full-scan phospholipid signal obtained with each method as well as overlaid ion images of the potassium salt of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 36:1 at m/z 826 and PC 40:6 at m/z 872 are shown as examples in Figure 2. The MS/MS spectrum of the m/z 826 peak, obtained directly from the dry-coated brain section, is also given. It shows the characteristic phosphocholine signal at m/z 184 and the neutral loss of the choline head group (\u221259 Da) as well as a potassium cyclophosphane peak at m/z 163. A consecutive MALDI spectrum acquired with a Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) showed a single peak at m/z 826.5723. The accurate mass obtained with the FTMS supports the identification of the species as PC 36:1 (calculated m/z 826.5728). While keeping the sample preparation steps simple and minimizing analyte delocalization, the dry-coating method produced high-quality molecular images showing signal intensity and phospholipid localization similar to those obtained from the spray-coated tissue section.\nFrom each dry-coated imaging experiment, dozens of ion images can be generated that clearly differentiate the anatomical structures of the brain. Several phospholipid images are shown in Figure 3. Some of the regions of the brain that were found to differentially express specific phospholipid distributions are identified in the H&E-stained serial section of the sagittal mouse brain. For example, the peak at m/z 741, which corresponds to potassium salt of sphingomyelin (SM 16:0), was found localized to the fourth and lateral ventricles. MS/MS analyses performed on the dry-coated sections supported the identifications of the phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species indicated in Figure 3. The identifications were confirmed by accurate mass measurements obtained directly from the dry-coated sections using FTMS.\nDry-coating can be used for high-resolution MALDI imaging, which is illustrated in Figure 4. Two sagittal mouse brain sections were dry-coated and the cerebellum regions were imaged at 40 \u00d7 50- and 30 \u00d7 35-\u03bcm lateral resolutions. A serial section was stained with H&E. The overlaid phospholipid images show the localization of PC 40:6 (m/z 872 in light blue), PC 36:1 and PC 38:4 (m/z 826 and 810 in red), and PC 38:6 (m/z 844 in green) in the cerebellar cortex, nucleus, and granule cell layer, respectively.\nIn conclusion, the solvent-free matrix dry-coating approach for phospholipid analysis and imaging can be an attractive alternative to methods that require the matrix to be dissolved in a solvent. With the dry-coating method, there is no significant analyte delocalization. Optimal matrix coverage is achieved when the tissue section is dried in a desiccator for no more than 10 to 15 min before dry-coating, suggesting that some moisture on the tissue aids microscale dissolvation of the surface layers of the matrix crystals. The spatial resolution of the image is limited by the size of the focused laser spot, the size of the individual matrix crystals, and percentage matrix coverage on tissue that, for the experiments reported here, was greater than 80%. The dry-coating procedure is a simple and fast method of producing a homogeneous matrix coating, which in turn can give high-quality phospholipid molecular images.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nIntroduction. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the subject of hot debates regarding \u201clow dose\u201d toxicological effects [1\u20133], i.e., effects at doses clearly below the present tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight [4, 5]. If such effects were proven to be pertinent for human health, exposure to sources so far considered minor might become relevant. Dermal exposure to BPA from thermal printer paper might be such a source.Thermal printer paper includes the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, i.e., a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark. Thermal printing papers are regularly used at workplaces like laboratories with recorders using such paper or at cash registers of shops.Kietzmann et al. [6] demonstrated the percutaneous absorption of deuterated BPA by bovine udders, though without concluding a quantitative uptake. Kaddar et al. [7] determined the cutaneous penetration of BPA into and through pig skin in a Franz diffusion cell. After 10\u00a0h, 5.4% of the applied dose (unknown amount in physiological serum) was found on the epidermis, 8.8% in the dermis, and 0.7% in the receptor fluid (totally 14.9%). The experimentation was stopped after 10\u00a0h, \u201cas this is the maximal BPA exposure time for workers\u201d (a statement to be questioned, since BPA remaining on the skin after the work may continue to migrate into the skin).This communication presents data on the transfer of BPA from thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers under various conditions. Some experiments on the uptake by the skin involved the skin of the fingers actually contacting thermal printer paper under conditions as realistic as possible. They provided data for a worst-case scenario, but were not adequate to investigate the extent of uptake into the human metabolism.Materials and methodsSamples of thermal printing papers consisted of receipts from various shops and paper of recorders for chromatographic instruments. Thermal printing paper was identified by its ability to turn dark upon heating. Ethanol absolute, HPLC-grade methanol, and HPLC-grade acetonitrile were from Baker (Deventer, NL).BPA was extracted from thermal paper (100\u00a0mg) by immersion in 10\u00a0ml methanol overnight at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Extracts were diluted 1:1,000 in 10% methanol/water. BPA transferred to fingers was recovered by moving fingers in 10\u00a0ml ethanol for 30\u00a0s. After each experiment, fingers were washed with warm water and soap to extract ethanol. The skin was dried by a towel and for at least several minutes in the air before the next experiment was started.Ethanol extracts were diluted 1:10 with deionized water. BPA was analyzed as described in [8]. Briefly, 500\u00a0\u03bcl diluted extract was injected into a 250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6-mm-i.d. column packed with Spherisorb ODS-2, 5\u00a0\u03bcm. BPA was eluted with a gradient of 50 to 100% acetonitrile (1\u00a0ml/min). Fluorescence was detected at 226/296\u00a0nm.The limit for quantitation was 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg in 10\u00a0ml ethanol. The response was linear from 0.1 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.994). Repeated injections (n\u2009=\u20096) of the same extract (1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) resulted in a relative standard deviation of 4%. The measuring uncertainty was below 10%.ResultsBPA in thermal printer paperTable\u00a01 lists BPA concentrations in 13 samples of thermal printer paper (mean of two determinations). In the 11 samples containing BPA, the mean concentration was 13.3\u00a0g/kg. Two papers did not contain BPA, indicating that such alternatives are available on the market.\nTable\u00a01BPA concentrations in thermal printing paperPaperBPA (g/kg)Receipt train service12Receipt canteen17Receipt shop 116Receipt shop 211Receipt shop 313Receipt shop 417Receipt shop 58Receipt shop 612Receipt shop 715Receipt shop 8<0.0005Recorder 111Recorder 216Tram ticket<0.0005Transfer to the fingersRecovery of BPA from fingers after touching thermal printing paper was checked by repeated extraction. The paper was firmly held with three fingers for 30\u00a0s, with the BPA-containing side contacting the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger. After moving the fingers in ethanol for 3\u00a0s, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was extracted. Immediately afterwards, the same fingers were immersed for an additional 5\u00a0s in fresh ethanol, from which 0.9\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was determined. A third extraction for 22\u00a0s yielded 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. It was decided to go for an intense extraction by moving the fingers in ethanol during 30 s, which might have included some BPA infiltrated into the surface layer of the skin.The two sides of the paper released very differing amounts of BPA: contacting the printed side transferred 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA; that of the rear side 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg (perhaps contaminated by set-off from the printed side).Extraction from fingers not previously used for related experiments released less than 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. After about 10 experiments including extraction with ethanol, washing with soap and drying, the fingers released traces close to 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA, presumably from deeper skin layers.For the experiments on the transfer of BPA from the paper to the fingers, a \u201cstandard\u201d was defined, from which individual parameters were varied. The standard involved the BPA-containing side of the thermal printing paper being pressed against the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger by the thumb for 5\u00a0s, applying a pressure as needed to pull the paper out of a printer. The skin was slightly greasy (either with natural grease of the skin of the forehead or from briefly touching tissue paper containing some vegetable oil), but not greasy to the extent that it left behind a visible mark on the paper. After each experiment, hands were intensely washed with soap and warm water.Four repeated experiments with recorder papers 1 and 2, containing 11 and 16\u00a0g/kg BPA, respectively (Table\u00a02), transferred 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 23% and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 21%, respectively (which is far beyond the uncertainty of the measurement).\nTable\u00a02BPA transferred to fingers under standard conditions (individual measurements for two fingers; mean per finger)PaperBPA content in paper (g/kg)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Mean/finger (\u03bcg)Recorder 1110.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.20.13Recorder 2161.2, 0.9, 1.5. 1.10.6Receipt canteen176.0, 5.03.3Receipt shop 4170.7, 1.30.5Receipt shop 7152.0, 2.21.1Data on the BPA transfer from five thermal printing papers under standard conditions are shown in Table\u00a02. Amounts of BPA found on the fingers were not directly related to the BPA concentration in the paper, which might be due to differing BPA distribution in the paper surface and varying integrity of the fiber layer containing the BPA. The mean transfer on a single finger was 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg.Table\u00a03 shows the influence of the skin properties on the BPA transfer. Compared with the standard (slightly greasy) skin, dry skin resulting from washing with soap and drying for about 5\u00a0min picked up somewhat less BPA from recorder paper 2, but no difference was observed for the receipt of shop 4. The BPA transfer was strongly increased for humid fingers (leaving visible humidity on the paper), e.g., with some saliva as commonly applied to better grip paper. After this kind of contact, a whitish stain was visible on the finger, suggesting that a surface layer of the paper disintegrated and was transferred to the skin. With wet skin, softened in warm water and just shaken to remove the excess water, transfer was still higher. Oily fingers (leaving a visible mark on the paper) also increased the transfer to about 10\u00a0\u03bcg. No whitish stain was observed on the finger pads, suggesting that transfer to oily fingers occurred by extraction of BPA from the paper rather than from dissolved fiber structure.\nTable\u00a03Transfer of BPA to two fingers depending on skin properties (papers according to Table\u00a01; individual measurements)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Recorder 2Shop 4Standard (slightly greasy skin)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.10.7, 1.3Dry skin after washing and drying0.7, 0.61.0, 0.6Humid finger7, 28Wet fingers46, 36Oily finger14, 911, 7Table\u00a04 reports amounts of BPA transferred to the two fingers with standard slightly greasy skin surface, but varying the mode of holding the paper (recorder paper 2). Keeping the paper at standard pressure for only 1\u00a0s caused the transfer to be reduced by a factor of about three. Holding it for 5\u00a0s at the minimal pressure to prevent it falling resulted in poorly reproduced lower transfer. Perhaps against intuition, pulling the paper through the fingers with standard pressure for 5\u00a0s also yielded a smaller transfer, which suggests that abrasion of the surface layer was not relevant for normal skin and transfer was primarily via extraction into the skin. Holding prolonged to 60\u00a0s was similar to the standard conditions, which means that the skin was saturated in less than 5\u00a0s.\nTable\u00a04BPA transfer to two fingers depending on the mode of holding the paper (individual results)Mode of holding paperBPA on finger (\u03bcg)Holding 1\u00a0s0.4, 0.3Holding 5\u00a0s, standard1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.1\u00a0Low pressure0.7, 0.2\u00a0Pulling paper through fingers0.6, 0.8Holding 60\u00a0s1.5, 0.7Table\u00a05 reports on the effect of repeated contact with always fresh spots of recorder paper 2. Three or even ten standard contacts did not increase the amount of BPA on the skin, which suggests that equilibrium between the BPA concentration in the paper and the surface layer of the skin was reached. In practice it means that a person working at a cash register and touching a receipt every few minutes does not accumulate more BPA than another person touching such paper much less frequently. The last experiment tested the reverse situation: after a standard contact, a clean paper was contacted (5\u00a0s, same pressure) at three different spots, checking whether this would transfer BPA back to paper. Interestingly, the amount of BPA on the finger did not decrease significantly: the BPA seemed to firmly adhere to the skin surface, which in practice means that the person at a cash register is unlikely to transfer substantial amounts of BPA to the food packs or other surfaces. These data suggest that the amount of BPA on the contaminated skin surface remains fairly constant.\nTable\u00a05BPA transfer during repeated contactsNumber of contactsBPA on finger (\u03bcg)1 (standard)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.131.1, .9101.3, 0.71, then 3 with clean paper1.0, 0.7Experiments regarding the penetration into or through the skinOf 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA applied to a finger as a solution in ethanol (10\u00a0\u03bcl, 1\u00a0mg/ml), extraction by ethanol shortly after evaporation of the solvent recovered 95%. Recovery 90\u00a0min after application, however, was below the detection limit, i.e., corresponded to less than 5% of the amount applied. With a 60-min interval between application and extraction, 10% was recovered. Evaporation of BPA from the skin was ruled out by wrapping aluminum foil tightly around the finger (including extraction of the latter for determining potential transfer from the warm finger to the cooler foil). It is assumed that the BPA which cannot be extracted with ethanol during 30\u00a0s can no longer be washed off and either remains in the skin surface until the stratum corneum is removed or migrates into and perhaps through the dermis.The experiment was repeated by applying 1\u00a0\u03bcl of a 10\u00a0mg/ml BPA solution to the finger pad, i.e., the same amount of BPA in ten times less ethanol, varying the interval between the application and the extraction from 5 to 90\u00a0min. After some 15\u00a0min only half of the BPA was recovered, but some 40% remained extractable with ethanol even after 1.5\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a01; mean values from two experiments). This indicates that ethanol was a vector supporting the penetration of the skin surface.\nFig.\u00a01BPA recovered by extraction of the skin with ethanol after the times shown on the x-axis; 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA in 1\u00a0\u03bcl of ethanol applied to a finger padThe next experiment was performed without ethanol: recorder paper 2 was touched with the wet forefinger and middle finger for 5\u00a0s. BPA on the forefinger was extracted with ethanol either immediately, or with a delay of 20 or 60\u00a0min. Then the hand was washed with soap and cold or hot water, rubbing the contaminated middle finger, and BPA on the middle finger was also extracted with ethanol. The recovered amounts of BPA in the left column of Table\u00a06 indicate that the amount of BPA directly extracted with ethanol did not significantly decrease with a delay of up to 60\u00a0min (with a high uncertainty resulting from the difficulty in reproducibly transferring a given amount of BPA in this way). After washing with cold water, some 5\u20138% of the BPA was recovered by ethanol. After washing with warm water, it was clearly less. There was no significant increase in the amount of BPA only recoverable with ethanol after a longer waiting period which would have supported progressive penetration of BPA deeper into the skin. It was concluded that the relatively large amount of BPA transferred to wet fingers remained on the surface and was largely removable by (intense) washing. This might be explained by a large part of the BPA being located in particles which are in only loose contact with the skin.\nTable 6BPA transferred onto fingers by wet contact; amounts extractable with ethanol directly or after washing with soap and cold or warm water, either immediately after contacting recorder paper 2 or after waiting 20 or 60 minDirect extraction (\u03bcg)WashingExtraction after washing (\u03bcg)Recovered residue in skin (%)Cold water 46Immediately2.55.4 36After 20 min38.3 44After 60 min3.17.0Warm water 18, 33Immediately0.2, 0.41.1, 1.2 36, 25After 20 min0.1, 0.50.3, 2.0 22, 29After 60 min0.8, 0.33.6, 1.0Similar experiments involved standard dry skin on which no particles seemed to adhere (with a correspondingly lower transfer). In the first experiment, the four fingers of both hands except the thumb were brought into contact with recorder paper 2 using gentle pressure. BPA on the fingers of one hand was immediately extracted with ethanol, BPA of the other 2\u00a0h later. The amounts extracted after 2\u00a0h were not significantly lower (Table\u00a07; the recovery for the sum of the four fingers was calculated as 88%). This also indicates that BPA\u2014in presumably more intimate skin contact\u2014after touching the paper with dry fingers remained on the skin surface to a far higher proportion than after application in ethanol.\nTable\u00a07BPA transferred onto dry fingers by contacting recorder paper 2; extraction with ethanol immediately afterwards or 2\u00a0h laterExtractionEthanol extraction of BPA (\u03bcg)ForefingerMiddle fingerRing fingerLittle fingerSumImmediately0.60.71.113.4After 2\u00a0h0.60.810.63Recovery (%)88In the second, analogous experiment, the hands were washed with soap and warm water immediately after contacting the paper with the forefinger and the middle finger of both hands, then BPA was individually extracted from each finger with ethanol. None of the fingers released a detectable amount of BPA into ethanol (<0.05\u00a0\u03bcg; Table\u00a08), which means that from the roughly 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg BPA transferred to a finger in this way (Tables\u00a03 and 7), more than 90% was removed by washing. The same procedure was repeated by washing the fingers only 2\u00a0h after contacting the paper. Now the ethanol extracted measurable amounts of BPA (mean of 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg), i.e., washing only removed 73% of the BPA. This indicates that during the 2\u00a0h about 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg BPA migrated into the skin of a finger to such a depth that it was no longer removable by water.\nTable\u00a08BPA extracted with ethanol from fingers after contacting thermal printer paper and washing either immediately or after 2\u00a0hExtracted BPA (\u03bcg/finger)Immediate extraction<0.05, <0.05,<0.05,<0.05Extraction after 2\u00a0h0.2, 0.2, 0.06, 0.2Basically this experiment was not conclusive in as far as the amount of BPA penetrating the skin could have been larger than that detected by ethanol extraction (see experiment with BPA applied with ethanol, where after 90\u00a0min the BPA was no longer extractable with ethanol). However, in this experiment the amount no longer extractable by ethanol must have been small, as shown by the high recovery shown in Table\u00a07.DiscussionOn average, holding thermal printing paper transferred 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg BPA to the pad of a finger touching the BPA-containing side. Humid or very greasy skin easily picked up ten times more (maximum 23\u00a0\u03bcg/finger). The highest transfer with wet fingers involves particulate matter, i.e., fibers and particles from the disintegrated paper surface. Such BPA adhering to the skin via particles is rather easily removed by abrasion and it is not in as intimate contact with the skin as when it is dissolved in the skin surface itself.Touching a paper consecutively at several spots with normal (neither humid nor oily) skin did not increase the transfer, nor did touching BPA-free paper significantly decrease it, suggesting that staff regularly in contact with such paper, e.g., at a register desk, have a fairly constant amount of BPA on the skin all day long. When all ten finger pads occasionally contact thermal printer paper, on average a total of 11\u00a0\u03bcg BPA would be on the skin. This amount can easily be increased by an order of magnitude when a larger surface of the hand gets into contact with the BPA from the paper, e.g., when thermal printer paper is rumpled.The experiments did not enable us to determine whether or not BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism, but they did show that BPA can enter the skin to a depth such that it is no longer removable by washing hands. Such BPA either remains in the skin up to the renewal of the latter or migrates deeper and eventually reaches body fluid. There is ample time for the latter process once BPA can no longer be washed off.BPA applied to the finger pad with ethanol rapidly entered the skin to such an extent that after about 1\u00a0h it was no longer extractable even with ethanol for 30\u00a0s. Absorption of BPA transferred from paper was far weaker: after 2\u00a0h, most of the BPA could still be washed off. Hence uptake depends on a vector. Hand creams could be such vectors.Two hours after contacting thermal printer paper with dry skin, 27% of the BPA picked up could no longer be washed off by water, but was still extractable with ethanol. For the given paper this meant a corresponding uptake by the skin of 0.09\u00a0\u03bcg BPA per hour and finger. In a worst-case scenario this amount would finally enter the human metabolism. In a further elaboration of this scenario it could be assumed that all eight fingers and two thumbs of a person pick up BPA in this way. If the thermal printer paper transferring the highest amount of BPA (the receipt from the canteen; Table\u00a02) is touched frequently enough to maintain about 3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA on each finger pad (at least once every few hours), the uptake into the skin via ten digits during a working day of 10\u00a0h would be 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0h\u2009\u00d7\u2009(27% of 3\u00a0\u03bcg)/2\u00a0h\u2009=\u200941\u00a0\u03bcg. If the hands are not washed before going home, the 30\u00a0\u03bcg BPA left on the ten digits could also be resorbed, increasing the maximum exposure to 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day.The estimated potential exposure of 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day for normal skin is 42 times below the 3,000\u00a0\u03bcg/day that are derived from the present TDI using the normally assumed 60\u00a0kg body weight or eight times below the amount which is assumed to be safe by present European specific migration limit (SML of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg; EU-Directive 2002/72). The scenario took into account the highest transfer to the skin from the five thermal printer papers tested, but does not really consider the worst case, such as a contact with a much larger skin surface or the use of hand creams that increase the permeability of the skin. Each of these could increase exposure by a factor of ten.On the basis of the present TDI, thermal printer paper with BPA can probably be considered safe even for these reasonable worst cases, but it should be reconsidered more carefully once \u201clow dose\u201d effects are taken into account for risk assessment: it could cause far higher exposure than known for food.References1.European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on a request from the Commission related to 2,2-bis(4-hydroxphenyl)propane (bisphenol A) question number EFSA-Q-2005\u2013100, adopted on 29 November 2006The EFSA Journal20064281752.NTP (2008) NTP-CERHR monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of bisphenol A, September 2008, NIH Publication No. 08 \u2013 59943.MyersJPEnviron Health Perspect20091173093141:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXjvVWmur4%3D4.EFSAOpinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20064281755.EFSAOpinion on the toxicokinetics of bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20087591106.KietzmannMKr\u00e4nkePM\u00f6derMSchraderSWahrenMIsotopes Environ Health Stud19993512713410.1080/102560199082340851:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXmsVCn7.KaddarNHarth\u00e9CD\u00e9chaudHMappusEPugeatMJ Toxicol Environ Health20087147147310.1080/152873908019068241:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXjtFSisLo%3D8.Biedermann-BremSGrobKFjeldalPEur Food Res Technol20082271053106010.1007/s00217-008-0819-91:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXotVyltbs%3D\n\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

These effects are seen as potentially relevant for human health, even at doses clearly below the present tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight.\n\nQ2: How is BPA exposure assessed in the study? \nA2: The study used samples of thermal printing papers, which include the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, which is a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark. \n\nQ3: What were the BPA concentrations found in the thermal printer paper samples?\nA3: The BPA concentrations in the thermal printing paper samples ranged from 13.3\u00a0g/kg to 16.0\u00a0g/kg. Two papers did not contain BPA, indicating that such alternatives are available on the market.\n\nQ4: How was the BPA transferred from the thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers?\nA4: The BPA was transferred from the thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers through direct contact. The study used a \"standard\" scenario, from which individual parameters were varied to investigate the extent of uptake into the human metabolism.\n\nQ5: What factors influenced the BPA transfer? \nA5: The study found that the amount of BPA transferred depended on several factors, including the skin properties and the mode of holding the paper. For example, dry skin picked up less BPA from the paper, while humid fingers (with some saliva) easily transferred ten times more BPA. \n\nQ6: How much BPA can a person working at a cash register expect to have on their skin? \nA6: According to the study, a person who regularly touches thermal printer paper, such as at a cash register, would have a fairly constant amount of BPA on their skin all day long. On average, this added up to 11\u00a0\u03bcg BPA per finger. \n\nQ7: Did the experiments prove that BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism? \nA7: The experiments did not directly prove that BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism, but they did show that BPA can enter the skin to a depth such that it is no longer removable by washing hands. \n\nQ8: What was the highest transfer of BPA to the skin in the experiments? \nA8: The highest transfer of BPA to the skin was recorded in an experiment where thermal printer paper with a BPA concentration of 16.0\u00a0g/kg was touched for 5 seconds with slightly greasy skin. In this scenario, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was transferred. \n\nQ9: How much BPA remains on the skin after washing? \nA9: According to the study, a significant amount of BPA can remain on the skin even after washing. In an experiment where 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was applied to a finger as a solution in ethanol and then washed with soap and warm water, only 0.7% of the BPA was recovered. \n\nQ10: Based on the paper, is thermal printer paper with BPA safe for use? \nA10: The paper suggests that thermal printer paper with BPA can probably be considered safe for reasonable worst cases, based on the present Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI). However, it suggests that the risk assessment should be reconsidered once \u201clow dose\u201d effects are taken into account.",

        "txt": "Introduction. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the subject of hot debates regarding \u201clow dose\u201d toxicological effects [1\u20133], i.e., effects at doses clearly below the present tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight [4, 5]. If such effects were proven to be pertinent for human health, exposure to sources so far considered minor might become relevant. Dermal exposure to BPA from thermal printer paper might be such a source.Thermal printer paper includes the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, i.e., a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark. Thermal printing papers are regularly used at workplaces like laboratories with recorders using such paper or at cash registers of shops.Kietzmann et al. [6] demonstrated the percutaneous absorption of deuterated BPA by bovine udders, though without concluding a quantitative uptake. Kaddar et al. [7] determined the cutaneous penetration of BPA into and through pig skin in a Franz diffusion cell. After 10\u00a0h, 5.4% of the applied dose (unknown amount in physiological serum) was found on the epidermis, 8.8% in the dermis, and 0.7% in the receptor fluid (totally 14.9%). The experimentation was stopped after 10\u00a0h, \u201cas this is the maximal BPA exposure time for workers\u201d (a statement to be questioned, since BPA remaining on the skin after the work may continue to migrate into the skin).This communication presents data on the transfer of BPA from thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers under various conditions. Some experiments on the uptake by the skin involved the skin of the fingers actually contacting thermal printer paper under conditions as realistic as possible. They provided data for a worst-case scenario, but were not adequate to investigate the extent of uptake into the human metabolism.Materials and methodsSamples of thermal printing papers consisted of receipts from various shops and paper of recorders for chromatographic instruments. Thermal printing paper was identified by its ability to turn dark upon heating. Ethanol absolute, HPLC-grade methanol, and HPLC-grade acetonitrile were from Baker (Deventer, NL).BPA was extracted from thermal paper (100\u00a0mg) by immersion in 10\u00a0ml methanol overnight at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Extracts were diluted 1:1,000 in 10% methanol/water. BPA transferred to fingers was recovered by moving fingers in 10\u00a0ml ethanol for 30\u00a0s. After each experiment, fingers were washed with warm water and soap to extract ethanol. The skin was dried by a towel and for at least several minutes in the air before the next experiment was started.Ethanol extracts were diluted 1:10 with deionized water. BPA was analyzed as described in [8]. Briefly, 500\u00a0\u03bcl diluted extract was injected into a 250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6-mm-i.d. column packed with Spherisorb ODS-2, 5\u00a0\u03bcm. BPA was eluted with a gradient of 50 to 100% acetonitrile (1\u00a0ml/min). Fluorescence was detected at 226/296\u00a0nm.The limit for quantitation was 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg in 10\u00a0ml ethanol. The response was linear from 0.1 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.994). Repeated injections (n\u2009=\u20096) of the same extract (1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) resulted in a relative standard deviation of 4%. The measuring uncertainty was below 10%.ResultsBPA in thermal printer paperTable\u00a01 lists BPA concentrations in 13 samples of thermal printer paper (mean of two determinations). In the 11 samples containing BPA, the mean concentration was 13.3\u00a0g/kg. Two papers did not contain BPA, indicating that such alternatives are available on the market.\nTable\u00a01BPA concentrations in thermal printing paperPaperBPA (g/kg)Receipt train service12Receipt canteen17Receipt shop 116Receipt shop 211Receipt shop 313Receipt shop 417Receipt shop 58Receipt shop 612Receipt shop 715Receipt shop 8<0.0005Recorder 111Recorder 216Tram ticket<0.0005Transfer to the fingersRecovery of BPA from fingers after touching thermal printing paper was checked by repeated extraction. The paper was firmly held with three fingers for 30\u00a0s, with the BPA-containing side contacting the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger. After moving the fingers in ethanol for 3\u00a0s, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was extracted. Immediately afterwards, the same fingers were immersed for an additional 5\u00a0s in fresh ethanol, from which 0.9\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was determined. A third extraction for 22\u00a0s yielded 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. It was decided to go for an intense extraction by moving the fingers in ethanol during 30 s, which might have included some BPA infiltrated into the surface layer of the skin.The two sides of the paper released very differing amounts of BPA: contacting the printed side transferred 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA; that of the rear side 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg (perhaps contaminated by set-off from the printed side).Extraction from fingers not previously used for related experiments released less than 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. After about 10 experiments including extraction with ethanol, washing with soap and drying, the fingers released traces close to 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA, presumably from deeper skin layers.For the experiments on the transfer of BPA from the paper to the fingers, a \u201cstandard\u201d was defined, from which individual parameters were varied. The standard involved the BPA-containing side of the thermal printing paper being pressed against the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger by the thumb for 5\u00a0s, applying a pressure as needed to pull the paper out of a printer. The skin was slightly greasy (either with natural grease of the skin of the forehead or from briefly touching tissue paper containing some vegetable oil), but not greasy to the extent that it left behind a visible mark on the paper. After each experiment, hands were intensely washed with soap and warm water.Four repeated experiments with recorder papers 1 and 2, containing 11 and 16\u00a0g/kg BPA, respectively (Table\u00a02), transferred 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 23% and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 21%, respectively (which is far beyond the uncertainty of the measurement).\nTable\u00a02BPA transferred to fingers under standard conditions (individual measurements for two fingers; mean per finger)PaperBPA content in paper (g/kg)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Mean/finger (\u03bcg)Recorder 1110.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.20.13Recorder 2161.2, 0.9, 1.5. 1.10.6Receipt canteen176.0, 5.03.3Receipt shop 4170.7, 1.30.5Receipt shop 7152.0, 2.21.1Data on the BPA transfer from five thermal printing papers under standard conditions are shown in Table\u00a02. Amounts of BPA found on the fingers were not directly related to the BPA concentration in the paper, which might be due to differing BPA distribution in the paper surface and varying integrity of the fiber layer containing the BPA. The mean transfer on a single finger was 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg.Table\u00a03 shows the influence of the skin properties on the BPA transfer. Compared with the standard (slightly greasy) skin, dry skin resulting from washing with soap and drying for about 5\u00a0min picked up somewhat less BPA from recorder paper 2, but no difference was observed for the receipt of shop 4. The BPA transfer was strongly increased for humid fingers (leaving visible humidity on the paper), e.g., with some saliva as commonly applied to better grip paper. After this kind of contact, a whitish stain was visible on the finger, suggesting that a surface layer of the paper disintegrated and was transferred to the skin. With wet skin, softened in warm water and just shaken to remove the excess water, transfer was still higher. Oily fingers (leaving a visible mark on the paper) also increased the transfer to about 10\u00a0\u03bcg. No whitish stain was observed on the finger pads, suggesting that transfer to oily fingers occurred by extraction of BPA from the paper rather than from dissolved fiber structure.\nTable\u00a03Transfer of BPA to two fingers depending on skin properties (papers according to Table\u00a01; individual measurements)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Recorder 2Shop 4Standard (slightly greasy skin)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.10.7, 1.3Dry skin after washing and drying0.7, 0.61.0, 0.6Humid finger7, 28Wet fingers46, 36Oily finger14, 911, 7Table\u00a04 reports amounts of BPA transferred to the two fingers with standard slightly greasy skin surface, but varying the mode of holding the paper (recorder paper 2). Keeping the paper at standard pressure for only 1\u00a0s caused the transfer to be reduced by a factor of about three. Holding it for 5\u00a0s at the minimal pressure to prevent it falling resulted in poorly reproduced lower transfer. Perhaps against intuition, pulling the paper through the fingers with standard pressure for 5\u00a0s also yielded a smaller transfer, which suggests that abrasion of the surface layer was not relevant for normal skin and transfer was primarily via extraction into the skin. Holding prolonged to 60\u00a0s was similar to the standard conditions, which means that the skin was saturated in less than 5\u00a0s.\nTable\u00a04BPA transfer to two fingers depending on the mode of holding the paper (individual results)Mode of holding paperBPA on finger (\u03bcg)Holding 1\u00a0s0.4, 0.3Holding 5\u00a0s, standard1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.1\u00a0Low pressure0.7, 0.2\u00a0Pulling paper through fingers0.6, 0.8Holding 60\u00a0s1.5, 0.7Table\u00a05 reports on the effect of repeated contact with always fresh spots of recorder paper 2. Three or even ten standard contacts did not increase the amount of BPA on the skin, which suggests that equilibrium between the BPA concentration in the paper and the surface layer of the skin was reached. In practice it means that a person working at a cash register and touching a receipt every few minutes does not accumulate more BPA than another person touching such paper much less frequently. The last experiment tested the reverse situation: after a standard contact, a clean paper was contacted (5\u00a0s, same pressure) at three different spots, checking whether this would transfer BPA back to paper. Interestingly, the amount of BPA on the finger did not decrease significantly: the BPA seemed to firmly adhere to the skin surface, which in practice means that the person at a cash register is unlikely to transfer substantial amounts of BPA to the food packs or other surfaces. These data suggest that the amount of BPA on the contaminated skin surface remains fairly constant.\nTable\u00a05BPA transfer during repeated contactsNumber of contactsBPA on finger (\u03bcg)1 (standard)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.131.1, .9101.3, 0.71, then 3 with clean paper1.0, 0.7Experiments regarding the penetration into or through the skinOf 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA applied to a finger as a solution in ethanol (10\u00a0\u03bcl, 1\u00a0mg/ml), extraction by ethanol shortly after evaporation of the solvent recovered 95%. Recovery 90\u00a0min after application, however, was below the detection limit, i.e., corresponded to less than 5% of the amount applied. With a 60-min interval between application and extraction, 10% was recovered. Evaporation of BPA from the skin was ruled out by wrapping aluminum foil tightly around the finger (including extraction of the latter for determining potential transfer from the warm finger to the cooler foil). It is assumed that the BPA which cannot be extracted with ethanol during 30\u00a0s can no longer be washed off and either remains in the skin surface until the stratum corneum is removed or migrates into and perhaps through the dermis.The experiment was repeated by applying 1\u00a0\u03bcl of a 10\u00a0mg/ml BPA solution to the finger pad, i.e., the same amount of BPA in ten times less ethanol, varying the interval between the application and the extraction from 5 to 90\u00a0min. After some 15\u00a0min only half of the BPA was recovered, but some 40% remained extractable with ethanol even after 1.5\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a01; mean values from two experiments). This indicates that ethanol was a vector supporting the penetration of the skin surface.\nFig.\u00a01BPA recovered by extraction of the skin with ethanol after the times shown on the x-axis; 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA in 1\u00a0\u03bcl of ethanol applied to a finger padThe next experiment was performed without ethanol: recorder paper 2 was touched with the wet forefinger and middle finger for 5\u00a0s. BPA on the forefinger was extracted with ethanol either immediately, or with a delay of 20 or 60\u00a0min. Then the hand was washed with soap and cold or hot water, rubbing the contaminated middle finger, and BPA on the middle finger was also extracted with ethanol. The recovered amounts of BPA in the left column of Table\u00a06 indicate that the amount of BPA directly extracted with ethanol did not significantly decrease with a delay of up to 60\u00a0min (with a high uncertainty resulting from the difficulty in reproducibly transferring a given amount of BPA in this way). After washing with cold water, some 5\u20138% of the BPA was recovered by ethanol. After washing with warm water, it was clearly less. There was no significant increase in the amount of BPA only recoverable with ethanol after a longer waiting period which would have supported progressive penetration of BPA deeper into the skin. It was concluded that the relatively large amount of BPA transferred to wet fingers remained on the surface and was largely removable by (intense) washing. This might be explained by a large part of the BPA being located in particles which are in only loose contact with the skin.\nTable 6BPA transferred onto fingers by wet contact; amounts extractable with ethanol directly or after washing with soap and cold or warm water, either immediately after contacting recorder paper 2 or after waiting 20 or 60 minDirect extraction (\u03bcg)WashingExtraction after washing (\u03bcg)Recovered residue in skin (%)Cold water 46Immediately2.55.4 36After 20 min38.3 44After 60 min3.17.0Warm water 18, 33Immediately0.2, 0.41.1, 1.2 36, 25After 20 min0.1, 0.50.3, 2.0 22, 29After 60 min0.8, 0.33.6, 1.0Similar experiments involved standard dry skin on which no particles seemed to adhere (with a correspondingly lower transfer). In the first experiment, the four fingers of both hands except the thumb were brought into contact with recorder paper 2 using gentle pressure. BPA on the fingers of one hand was immediately extracted with ethanol, BPA of the other 2\u00a0h later. The amounts extracted after 2\u00a0h were not significantly lower (Table\u00a07; the recovery for the sum of the four fingers was calculated as 88%). This also indicates that BPA\u2014in presumably more intimate skin contact\u2014after touching the paper with dry fingers remained on the skin surface to a far higher proportion than after application in ethanol.\nTable\u00a07BPA transferred onto dry fingers by contacting recorder paper 2; extraction with ethanol immediately afterwards or 2\u00a0h laterExtractionEthanol extraction of BPA (\u03bcg)ForefingerMiddle fingerRing fingerLittle fingerSumImmediately0.60.71.113.4After 2\u00a0h0.60.810.63Recovery (%)88In the second, analogous experiment, the hands were washed with soap and warm water immediately after contacting the paper with the forefinger and the middle finger of both hands, then BPA was individually extracted from each finger with ethanol. None of the fingers released a detectable amount of BPA into ethanol (<0.05\u00a0\u03bcg; Table\u00a08), which means that from the roughly 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg BPA transferred to a finger in this way (Tables\u00a03 and 7), more than 90% was removed by washing. The same procedure was repeated by washing the fingers only 2\u00a0h after contacting the paper. Now the ethanol extracted measurable amounts of BPA (mean of 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg), i.e., washing only removed 73% of the BPA. This indicates that during the 2\u00a0h about 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg BPA migrated into the skin of a finger to such a depth that it was no longer removable by water.\nTable\u00a08BPA extracted with ethanol from fingers after contacting thermal printer paper and washing either immediately or after 2\u00a0hExtracted BPA (\u03bcg/finger)Immediate extraction<0.05, <0.05,<0.05,<0.05Extraction after 2\u00a0h0.2, 0.2, 0.06, 0.2Basically this experiment was not conclusive in as far as the amount of BPA penetrating the skin could have been larger than that detected by ethanol extraction (see experiment with BPA applied with ethanol, where after 90\u00a0min the BPA was no longer extractable with ethanol). However, in this experiment the amount no longer extractable by ethanol must have been small, as shown by the high recovery shown in Table\u00a07.DiscussionOn average, holding thermal printing paper transferred 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg BPA to the pad of a finger touching the BPA-containing side. Humid or very greasy skin easily picked up ten times more (maximum 23\u00a0\u03bcg/finger). The highest transfer with wet fingers involves particulate matter, i.e., fibers and particles from the disintegrated paper surface. Such BPA adhering to the skin via particles is rather easily removed by abrasion and it is not in as intimate contact with the skin as when it is dissolved in the skin surface itself.Touching a paper consecutively at several spots with normal (neither humid nor oily) skin did not increase the transfer, nor did touching BPA-free paper significantly decrease it, suggesting that staff regularly in contact with such paper, e.g., at a register desk, have a fairly constant amount of BPA on the skin all day long. When all ten finger pads occasionally contact thermal printer paper, on average a total of 11\u00a0\u03bcg BPA would be on the skin. This amount can easily be increased by an order of magnitude when a larger surface of the hand gets into contact with the BPA from the paper, e.g., when thermal printer paper is rumpled.The experiments did not enable us to determine whether or not BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism, but they did show that BPA can enter the skin to a depth such that it is no longer removable by washing hands. Such BPA either remains in the skin up to the renewal of the latter or migrates deeper and eventually reaches body fluid. There is ample time for the latter process once BPA can no longer be washed off.BPA applied to the finger pad with ethanol rapidly entered the skin to such an extent that after about 1\u00a0h it was no longer extractable even with ethanol for 30\u00a0s. Absorption of BPA transferred from paper was far weaker: after 2\u00a0h, most of the BPA could still be washed off. Hence uptake depends on a vector. Hand creams could be such vectors.Two hours after contacting thermal printer paper with dry skin, 27% of the BPA picked up could no longer be washed off by water, but was still extractable with ethanol. For the given paper this meant a corresponding uptake by the skin of 0.09\u00a0\u03bcg BPA per hour and finger. In a worst-case scenario this amount would finally enter the human metabolism. In a further elaboration of this scenario it could be assumed that all eight fingers and two thumbs of a person pick up BPA in this way. If the thermal printer paper transferring the highest amount of BPA (the receipt from the canteen; Table\u00a02) is touched frequently enough to maintain about 3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA on each finger pad (at least once every few hours), the uptake into the skin via ten digits during a working day of 10\u00a0h would be 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0h\u2009\u00d7\u2009(27% of 3\u00a0\u03bcg)/2\u00a0h\u2009=\u200941\u00a0\u03bcg. If the hands are not washed before going home, the 30\u00a0\u03bcg BPA left on the ten digits could also be resorbed, increasing the maximum exposure to 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day.The estimated potential exposure of 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day for normal skin is 42 times below the 3,000\u00a0\u03bcg/day that are derived from the present TDI using the normally assumed 60\u00a0kg body weight or eight times below the amount which is assumed to be safe by present European specific migration limit (SML of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg; EU-Directive 2002/72). The scenario took into account the highest transfer to the skin from the five thermal printer papers tested, but does not really consider the worst case, such as a contact with a much larger skin surface or the use of hand creams that increase the permeability of the skin. Each of these could increase exposure by a factor of ten.On the basis of the present TDI, thermal printer paper with BPA can probably be considered safe even for these reasonable worst cases, but it should be reconsidered more carefully once \u201clow dose\u201d effects are taken into account for risk assessment: it could cause far higher exposure than known for food.References1.European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on a request from the Commission related to 2,2-bis(4-hydroxphenyl)propane (bisphenol A) question number EFSA-Q-2005\u2013100, adopted on 29 November 2006The EFSA Journal20064281752.NTP (2008) NTP-CERHR monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of bisphenol A, September 2008, NIH Publication No. 08 \u2013 59943.MyersJPEnviron Health Perspect20091173093141:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXjvVWmur4%3D4.EFSAOpinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20064281755.EFSAOpinion on the toxicokinetics of bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20087591106.KietzmannMKr\u00e4nkePM\u00f6derMSchraderSWahrenMIsotopes Environ Health Stud19993512713410.1080/102560199082340851:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXmsVCn7.KaddarNHarth\u00e9CD\u00e9chaudHMappusEPugeatMJ Toxicol Environ Health20087147147310.1080/152873908019068241:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXjtFSisLo%3D8.Biedermann-BremSGrobKFjeldalPEur Food Res Technol20082271053106010.1007/s00217-008-0819-91:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXotVyltbs%3D\n"

Recently, much attention has been directed to the use of low dimensional nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes, as building blocks in the production of hierarchical nanostructures because of various novel applications. Lieber and colleagues developed a technique for a large-scale hierarchical organization of NWs arrays for integrated nanosystems , whereas Wang and colleagues reported that novel hierarchical nanostructures based on NWs can be used as solar-cells and nanogenerators . Due to characteristic high porosity of hierarchical nanostructures, they also have been studied as photocatalysts and gas sensors . Gas sensing properties of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides have been comprehensively reviewed by Lee . To date, the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides can be classified into three categories. The first method involves high thermal evaporation of precursor powders accompanied by a low-temperature condensation. One-step and multi-steps of the thermal evaporation processes have been employed in the synthesis of different hierarchical nanostructures such as ZnO\u2013ZnO , ZnO\u2013SnO2 , SnO2\u2013SnO2 , and ZnO\u2013In2O3 , and WO3 . The second technique is a wet-chemical route, which is simple, environmentally friendly, operated low-temperatures, inexpensive, and products high-throughput . The third option is a combination of the first two methods . It can be recognized that the hierarchization strategy consists of two-step vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) growths are frequently used because the hierarchical NWs can be precisely controlled through the thermal evaporation steps. The first step is to grow the core NWs and the second step is to grow the outer NWs by reseeding of nanoparticle catalysts on the core NWs surface.\nPrevious studies have reported that hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures are relatively good gas sensors . More or less, the gas sensing properties of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures prepared by a two-step thermal evaporation process can be enhanced by the deposition of the gold nanoparticles in the core NWs before the second step of the thermal evaporation process. This is likely the materials are functionalized with catalyst active materials (Au catalyst), resulting in the enhancement of gas sensing properties. This study is the first to perform a comparison of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. SnO2 NWs are prepared through two different thermal evaporation processes, with one process for core NWs and another for outer secondary NWs. The two-step thermal evaporation process is used to synthesize hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures while excluding the gold catalyst to eliminate any effect it may have on the gas sensing properties of the fabricated hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. The gas sensing performances of the SnO2 NWs and hierarchical nanostructures are evaluated and compared.\nThe SnO2 NWs used in this study were synthesized through two different thermal evaporation processes. In the first process, SnO2 NWs were grown at 980 \u00b0C on Si substrates that have previously been deposited with Au catalyst, using SnO powder as the source. The second process is similar to the first, except that it was carried out at 800 \u00b0C with Sn powder as the source. These two processes, when done in series, produced hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, initially synthesizing core NWs and then outer nanostructures. Samples grown by the first process were termed as sample A, by the second process as sample B, and those by the two combined processes as sample C. Both processes have been described in detail in our previous studies . In brief, the SnO2 NWs were grown in a quartz tube located in a horizontal furnace (Lingdberg/Blue M, Model: TF55030A, USA). Pure SnO powder (for growing core NWs) or Sn powder (for growing outer NWs) was placed in an alumina boat as the evaporation source. Substrates with a layer of previously deposited Au catalyst by ion sputtering were placed approximately 1.5 cm from the source. Both methods were divided into two steps. Initially, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr and purged several times with high purity Ar gas (99.999%). Subsequently, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr again, and the furnace temperature was increased from room-temperature to 980 \u00b0C or 800 \u00b0C. When the growth temperature was reached, oxygen gas (99.99%) was added to the quartz tube at a flow rate of 0.3\u20130.5 sccm, while maintaining a pressure of \u223c2\u20135 Torr inside the tube. The growth temperature was maintained for 30 min. The morphology and crystal structure of SnO2 NW and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were investigated through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The XRD (Philips Xpert Pro) was operated with a CuK\u03b1 radiation generated at 40 kV. The PL spectra were acquired at room-temperature from 360 to 910 nm using a 325 nm He\u2013Cd laser.\nTo characterize the gas sensing properties, synthesized SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a pre-fabricated interdigitated electrode substrate using a micropipette. Numerous drops were placed on the electrode to generate a thick film of each of the samples, which can eliminate the effect of SnO2 NWs film thickness and NWs density on gas sensing performance . The sensor fabricated from the SnO2 NWs grown at 980 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor A, that from SnO2 NWs grown at 800 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor B, and that from the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures was denoted as sensor C.\nThe gas sensing properties were studied by measuring all the sensors with liquid petroleum gas (LPG, 500\u20132000 ppm) and NH3 (300\u20131000 ppm) at different temperatures (50\u2013450 \u00b0C) using a homemade set up (Fig. 1 ) with high speed switching gas flow (from/to air to/from balance gas). Balance gases (0.1% in air) were purchased from Air Liquid Group, Singapore. The system employed a flow-through with a constant rate of 200 sccm.\nFE-SEM images of SnO2 NWs, samples A and B, are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The morphologies of NWs synthesized through different techniques do not differ from each other. Structural images of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sample C, are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The morphology of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures is distinct compared with SnO2 NWs. Core NWs appear distorted, and other NWs and nanobelts (NBs) seem to branch from them. Results are completely different from a previous report . This can be attributed to the modified procedure, where Au nanoparticles are not reseeded during the second growth process. This is verified by the similarity of the results reported in literature and the results obtained (Fig. 2(e) and (f)), in which Au nanoparticles were deposited on the core NWs as reseeding catalysts for the outer NWs growth. The growth mechanism of SnO2 core NWs with Au nanoparticles as catalysts had initially been elucidated by Wagner and Ellis based on the vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) process, followed by many researchers . We believe that the branched NWs/NBs were grown by a catalyst-free vapor\u2013solid (VS) process because the secondary outer NWs/NBs can be directly formed from the vapor phase in the absence of the catalyst . The following growth mechanism is proposed: some small Sn droplets from Sn vapor attach to the surface of the core NWs and form new growth sites. Once the Sn droplets completely attach to the surface of core NWs and become nucleation sites, epitaxial growth of branched NWs/NBs takes place. The branching pattern generated is not uniform because the Sn droplets were not homogeneous. Core NWs become distorted because of the oxidation of liquid Sn droplets coated the core NWs to SnO2.\nFig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the samples. All the diffraction peaks for the products match the tetragonal rutile SnO2 profile (a = 4.738 and c = 3.187) obtained from the JCPDS 77\u20130450 card. As such, nanostructures consist predominantly of pure SnO2. We have observed that the NWs density of the sample A was lower than that of sample B. This is an explanation why the peaks from sample A have lower intensity than that from sample B.\nThere are several papers in the literature that report on the luminescence spectra of SnO2 with different morphologies . It is recognized that oxygen vacancies play important roles in these luminescence bands as well as gas sensing properties. For these reasons, the room-temperature PL spectra of the SnO2 NWs from samples A, B, and C were characterized. Fig. 4 shows the room temperature PL spectra acquired from the samples. All spectra show a strong visible PL band at 620 nm, which has been consistently attributed to oxygen vacancies that are essential defects of metal oxides . Despite the morphological differences between SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, the same PL results are obtained from these samples. The reason for this is unclear, and further studies are necessary to obtain a plausible explanation. However, the hypothesis explanation is that the oxygen vacancies and sizes of nanowires and hierarchical nanostructures may not be much different.\nTo investigate and compare the gas sensing properties of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sensors were tested at different temperatures ranging from 50 to 450 \u00b0C with an interval of 50 \u00b0C to optimize working temperature. Responses were measured with LPG and NH3 gas at concentrations of 2000 and 1000 ppm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 , the temperature has an obvious influence on the response of the sensors to LPG and NH3 gas. The bell-shaped distribution of response against operating temperature reveals that optimum performance is achieved at 350 and 200 \u00b0C for LPG and NH3 gas, respectively. Previous work has also reported bell-shaped sensor responses . The maximum response values to 2000 ppm LPG and 1000 ppm NH3 gas were 6, 6.2, 20.4 and 7.1, 7.9, 21.7 for sensors A, B, and C, respectively. For both gases, the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructure exhibits a response that is three times that of the SnO2 NWs sensors at the optimal operating temperatures. Responses of the two SnO2 NW sensors are very similar, mainly because their morphologies and wire diameters are alike (Fig. 2). Comparing the response of sensor C to the two gases (LPG, NH3), temperature can be used to selectively detect NH3. For instance, at 200 \u00b0C, the response of sensor C to 1000 ppm NH3 is about 21.7, whereas its response to 2000 ppm LPG is about 2.5.\nAfter the optimized temperature was determined, response patterns to different gas concentrations were investigated. The three sensors were tested at 350 \u00b0C with LPG concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm. Fig. 6(a)\u2013(c) shows the dynamic response-recovery curves of sensors A, B, and C to LPG, respectively. The response amplitudes of all the sensors increase with increasing gas concentration [Fig. 6(d)]. As expected, compared with SnO2 NW sensors, the sensor based on hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures (sensor C) exhibits enhanced responses for each concentration. Fig. 7 presents the results of testing the sensors at 200 \u00b0C with NH3 concentrations of 300, 400, 500, 750 and 1000 ppm. It can be seen that hierarchical nanostructures sensor has a higher response to NH3 gas. This can be implied that the enhanced gas sensing response of the hierarchical nanostructures is relevant to other gases.\nIt has been demonstrated that the response (S = R a/R g) of oxide semiconductors is usually depicted as : S\u223c\u03b2[C]\u03b1 where \u03b2 denotes a constant, and [C] means the concentration of the target gas. In practical, the \u03b1 is in range from 1/2 to 1, dependent on the charge of the surface species, the stoichiometry of the elementary reactions on the surface and measurement range of the target gas. For the case of one-dimensional nanostructure SnO2, which has a good response to various gases, the \u03b1 value can be around 1 . In our case, we have also found that the sensor response to LPG and NH3 seem to be shown a linear relationship with gas concentration in the measured range (see Figs. 6(d) and 7(d)).\nWe have measured the sensor response with relative large number of gas pulse sequence and did not find out any change in the sensor response and the base-resistance of the sensor (data not shown). This can imply that the performance of the hierarchical nanostructure sensors has good repeatability and the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures materials are promising candidates for gas sensing applications. We have made comparison LPG and NH3 response of our SnO2 NWs and SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures sensors as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. It can be seen that the responses of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures to LPG and NH3 are comparable with reported values . However, SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures have not yet optimized for practical application. The sensor performance can be improved further by functionalization with active catalysts nanoparticles for detection of LPG and NH3 gas.\nThe mechanism of enhanced gas sensing performance of hierarchical nanostructures is still unclear. Q. Wan et al. reported that branched SnO2 NW sensors have higher responses to ethanol than general SnO2 NW sensors . However, we believe that the Au catalyst previously deposited in the second growth step of SnO2 branches may have had a role in enhancing the gas sensing performance. This is likely the case with SnO2 NWs functionalized with nanoparticle catalysts . Recently, the gas sensing performance of ZnO NWs and hierarchical ZnO nanostructures were compared, and the gas response enhancement of the latter was established and explained . Since the gas sensing mechanisms of ZnO and SnO2 nanostructures are very similar, enhancement of the gas sensing performance of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to (i) higher porosity, (ii) more active centers obtained from enhanced oxygen vacancy defects, and (iii) junctions of the core and outer NWs/NBs. To clearly understand the enhancement of gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures, we first explain the gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs sensors. As depicted in Fig. 8 , when SnO2 NWs is exposed in air, oxygen molecules will adsorb on the surface and capture electrons from the conductance band of the NWs to become oxygen ions (active surface complexes). The adsorbed oxygen ions on the SnO2 NWs act as electron acceptors that generate a surface depletion region on the surface of the NWs. The width of the depletion region is sensitive to the ambient gases. As exposed to LPG and NH3 gas (donated electrons molecules), the reactions between these molecules and the active chemical complexes (oxygen ions) on the surface will lead to the release of the trapped electrons, resulting in a decrease of the depletion width. This leads to a decrease of the resistance of along the longitudinal SnO2 NWs. However, our SnO2 NWs sensors are a network type and there are many NWs bridge between the two Pt electrodes forming many networking points of SnO2\u2013SnO2 NWs (see Fig. 8(a)). The potential barrier around the networking points are blocked the electrons flow in a more efficient way compared with the depletion region on the surface. Because the barriers, with adjustable thickness and height, control the transport of electrons between the NWs through the equation : R=R0expe\u0394VbkbT\nIn this equation, \u0394V b is the change of the barrier potential defined as the potential in air minus that in target gas, R 0 is a factor including the resistance in air and other parameters, e is the charge of an electron, k b is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. When the sensors are exposed to LPG and NH3, not only the depletion width on the surface of the NWs, but also the height of the barrier potential at the networking point contact will decrease. From the schematic illustration of gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), we can clearly see that the hierarchical nanostructures have a higher porosity and more active sites compared to the SnO2 WNs sensor. More importantly, the hierarchical nanostructures sensor has much higher network point contacts (see Fig. 8(b)). This can be dominant factor in enhancing the gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures.\nFor practical applications, the response and recovery times of the gas sensors are very important concerns. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) shows the plots of the dynamic resistance responses of the three sensors to 1000 ppm LPG and 300 ppm NH3 gas, respectively. The 90% response time for gas exposure [t 90%(air-to-gas)] and that for recovery [t 90%(gas-to-air)] were calculated from the resistance-time data shown in Fig. 9. The t 90%(air-to-gas) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 4 and 17 s, respectively, whereas the t 90%(gas-to-air) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 9 and 30 s, respectively. For each of the gases, response and recovery times do not differ greatly from each other. These tests were performed at the corresponding optimal temperatures of the sensors, which may have contributed to the differences in values between the different gases.\nThis study demonstrated the use of a two-step thermal evaporation method in synthesizing hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures for gas sensing applications. Gas sensors fabricated from SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures were used to study and compare the gas sensing performance of the different nanostructures. Comparative gas sensing tests showed that hierarchical nanostructures exhibit enhanced gas sensing performance, which may be attributed to high porosity, more active sites, and addition of core\u2013outer junctions to the materials. Thus, synthesized hierarchically porous SnO2 nanostructures have a great potential for gas sensor applications, in addition to being used as photocatalysts and anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, this work provides a simple and controllable approach that can be extended to the synthesis of other hierarchical nanotructures based on metal oxide materials, such as SnO2, In2O3, ZnO, WO3, and TiO2.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Development of methods for the controlled fabrication of nanostructures is currently the greatest challenge in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Recently, much attention has been directed to the use of low dimensional nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes, as building blocks in the production of hierarchical nanostructures because of various novel applications. Lieber and colleagues developed a technique for a large-scale hierarchical organization of NWs arrays for integrated nanosystems , whereas Wang and colleagues reported that novel hierarchical nanostructures based on NWs can be used as solar-cells and nanogenerators . Due to characteristic high porosity of hierarchical nanostructures, they also have been studied as photocatalysts and gas sensors . Gas sensing properties of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides have been comprehensively reviewed by Lee . To date, the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides can be classified into three categories. The first method involves high thermal evaporation of precursor powders accompanied by a low-temperature condensation. One-step and multi-steps of the thermal evaporation processes have been employed in the synthesis of different hierarchical nanostructures such as ZnO\u2013ZnO , ZnO\u2013SnO2 , SnO2\u2013SnO2 , and ZnO\u2013In2O3 , and WO3 . The second technique is a wet-chemical route, which is simple, environmentally friendly, operated low-temperatures, inexpensive, and products high-throughput . The third option is a combination of the first two methods . It can be recognized that the hierarchization strategy consists of two-step vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) growths are frequently used because the hierarchical NWs can be precisely controlled through the thermal evaporation steps. The first step is to grow the core NWs and the second step is to grow the outer NWs by reseeding of nanoparticle catalysts on the core NWs surface.\nPrevious studies have reported that hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures are relatively good gas sensors . More or less, the gas sensing properties of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures prepared by a two-step thermal evaporation process can be enhanced by the deposition of the gold nanoparticles in the core NWs before the second step of the thermal evaporation process. This is likely the materials are functionalized with catalyst active materials (Au catalyst), resulting in the enhancement of gas sensing properties. This study is the first to perform a comparison of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. SnO2 NWs are prepared through two different thermal evaporation processes, with one process for core NWs and another for outer secondary NWs. The two-step thermal evaporation process is used to synthesize hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures while excluding the gold catalyst to eliminate any effect it may have on the gas sensing properties of the fabricated hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. The gas sensing performances of the SnO2 NWs and hierarchical nanostructures are evaluated and compared.\nThe SnO2 NWs used in this study were synthesized through two different thermal evaporation processes. In the first process, SnO2 NWs were grown at 980 \u00b0C on Si substrates that have previously been deposited with Au catalyst, using SnO powder as the source. The second process is similar to the first, except that it was carried out at 800 \u00b0C with Sn powder as the source. These two processes, when done in series, produced hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, initially synthesizing core NWs and then outer nanostructures. Samples grown by the first process were termed as sample A, by the second process as sample B, and those by the two combined processes as sample C. Both processes have been described in detail in our previous studies . In brief, the SnO2 NWs were grown in a quartz tube located in a horizontal furnace (Lingdberg/Blue M, Model: TF55030A, USA). Pure SnO powder (for growing core NWs) or Sn powder (for growing outer NWs) was placed in an alumina boat as the evaporation source. Substrates with a layer of previously deposited Au catalyst by ion sputtering were placed approximately 1.5 cm from the source. Both methods were divided into two steps. Initially, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr and purged several times with high purity Ar gas (99.999%). Subsequently, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr again, and the furnace temperature was increased from room-temperature to 980 \u00b0C or 800 \u00b0C. When the growth temperature was reached, oxygen gas (99.99%) was added to the quartz tube at a flow rate of 0.3\u20130.5 sccm, while maintaining a pressure of \u223c2\u20135 Torr inside the tube. The growth temperature was maintained for 30 min. The morphology and crystal structure of SnO2 NW and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were investigated through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The XRD (Philips Xpert Pro) was operated with a CuK\u03b1 radiation generated at 40 kV. The PL spectra were acquired at room-temperature from 360 to 910 nm using a 325 nm He\u2013Cd laser.\nTo characterize the gas sensing properties, synthesized SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a pre-fabricated interdigitated electrode substrate using a micropipette. Numerous drops were placed on the electrode to generate a thick film of each of the samples, which can eliminate the effect of SnO2 NWs film thickness and NWs density on gas sensing performance . The sensor fabricated from the SnO2 NWs grown at 980 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor A, that from SnO2 NWs grown at 800 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor B, and that from the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures was denoted as sensor C.\nThe gas sensing properties were studied by measuring all the sensors with liquid petroleum gas (LPG, 500\u20132000 ppm) and NH3 (300\u20131000 ppm) at different temperatures (50\u2013450 \u00b0C) using a homemade set up (Fig. 1 ) with high speed switching gas flow (from/to air to/from balance gas). Balance gases (0.1% in air) were purchased from Air Liquid Group, Singapore. The system employed a flow-through with a constant rate of 200 sccm.\nFE-SEM images of SnO2 NWs, samples A and B, are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The morphologies of NWs synthesized through different techniques do not differ from each other. Structural images of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sample C, are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The morphology of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures is distinct compared with SnO2 NWs. Core NWs appear distorted, and other NWs and nanobelts (NBs) seem to branch from them. Results are completely different from a previous report . This can be attributed to the modified procedure, where Au nanoparticles are not reseeded during the second growth process. This is verified by the similarity of the results reported in literature and the results obtained (Fig. 2(e) and (f)), in which Au nanoparticles were deposited on the core NWs as reseeding catalysts for the outer NWs growth. The growth mechanism of SnO2 core NWs with Au nanoparticles as catalysts had initially been elucidated by Wagner and Ellis based on the vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) process, followed by many researchers . We believe that the branched NWs/NBs were grown by a catalyst-free vapor\u2013solid (VS) process because the secondary outer NWs/NBs can be directly formed from the vapor phase in the absence of the catalyst . The following growth mechanism is proposed: some small Sn droplets from Sn vapor attach to the surface of the core NWs and form new growth sites. Once the Sn droplets completely attach to the surface of core NWs and become nucleation sites, epitaxial growth of branched NWs/NBs takes place. The branching pattern generated is not uniform because the Sn droplets were not homogeneous. Core NWs become distorted because of the oxidation of liquid Sn droplets coated the core NWs to SnO2.\nFig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the samples. All the diffraction peaks for the products match the tetragonal rutile SnO2 profile (a = 4.738 and c = 3.187) obtained from the JCPDS 77\u20130450 card. As such, nanostructures consist predominantly of pure SnO2. We have observed that the NWs density of the sample A was lower than that of sample B. This is an explanation why the peaks from sample A have lower intensity than that from sample B.\nThere are several papers in the literature that report on the luminescence spectra of SnO2 with different morphologies . It is recognized that oxygen vacancies play important roles in these luminescence bands as well as gas sensing properties. For these reasons, the room-temperature PL spectra of the SnO2 NWs from samples A, B, and C were characterized. Fig. 4 shows the room temperature PL spectra acquired from the samples. All spectra show a strong visible PL band at 620 nm, which has been consistently attributed to oxygen vacancies that are essential defects of metal oxides . Despite the morphological differences between SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, the same PL results are obtained from these samples. The reason for this is unclear, and further studies are necessary to obtain a plausible explanation. However, the hypothesis explanation is that the oxygen vacancies and sizes of nanowires and hierarchical nanostructures may not be much different.\nTo investigate and compare the gas sensing properties of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sensors were tested at different temperatures ranging from 50 to 450 \u00b0C with an interval of 50 \u00b0C to optimize working temperature. Responses were measured with LPG and NH3 gas at concentrations of 2000 and 1000 ppm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 , the temperature has an obvious influence on the response of the sensors to LPG and NH3 gas. The bell-shaped distribution of response against operating temperature reveals that optimum performance is achieved at 350 and 200 \u00b0C for LPG and NH3 gas, respectively. Previous work has also reported bell-shaped sensor responses . The maximum response values to 2000 ppm LPG and 1000 ppm NH3 gas were 6, 6.2, 20.4 and 7.1, 7.9, 21.7 for sensors A, B, and C, respectively. For both gases, the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructure exhibits a response that is three times that of the SnO2 NWs sensors at the optimal operating temperatures. Responses of the two SnO2 NW sensors are very similar, mainly because their morphologies and wire diameters are alike (Fig. 2). Comparing the response of sensor C to the two gases (LPG, NH3), temperature can be used to selectively detect NH3. For instance, at 200 \u00b0C, the response of sensor C to 1000 ppm NH3 is about 21.7, whereas its response to 2000 ppm LPG is about 2.5.\nAfter the optimized temperature was determined, response patterns to different gas concentrations were investigated. The three sensors were tested at 350 \u00b0C with LPG concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm. Fig. 6(a)\u2013(c) shows the dynamic response-recovery curves of sensors A, B, and C to LPG, respectively. The response amplitudes of all the sensors increase with increasing gas concentration [Fig. 6(d)]. As expected, compared with SnO2 NW sensors, the sensor based on hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures (sensor C) exhibits enhanced responses for each concentration. Fig. 7 presents the results of testing the sensors at 200 \u00b0C with NH3 concentrations of 300, 400, 500, 750 and 1000 ppm. It can be seen that hierarchical nanostructures sensor has a higher response to NH3 gas. This can be implied that the enhanced gas sensing response of the hierarchical nanostructures is relevant to other gases.\nIt has been demonstrated that the response (S = R a/R g) of oxide semiconductors is usually depicted as : S\u223c\u03b2[C]\u03b1 where \u03b2 denotes a constant, and [C] means the concentration of the target gas. In practical, the \u03b1 is in range from 1/2 to 1, dependent on the charge of the surface species, the stoichiometry of the elementary reactions on the surface and measurement range of the target gas. For the case of one-dimensional nanostructure SnO2, which has a good response to various gases, the \u03b1 value can be around 1 . In our case, we have also found that the sensor response to LPG and NH3 seem to be shown a linear relationship with gas concentration in the measured range (see Figs. 6(d) and 7(d)).\nWe have measured the sensor response with relative large number of gas pulse sequence and did not find out any change in the sensor response and the base-resistance of the sensor (data not shown). This can imply that the performance of the hierarchical nanostructure sensors has good repeatability and the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures materials are promising candidates for gas sensing applications. We have made comparison LPG and NH3 response of our SnO2 NWs and SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures sensors as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. It can be seen that the responses of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures to LPG and NH3 are comparable with reported values . However, SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures have not yet optimized for practical application. The sensor performance can be improved further by functionalization with active catalysts nanoparticles for detection of LPG and NH3 gas.\nThe mechanism of enhanced gas sensing performance of hierarchical nanostructures is still unclear. Q. Wan et al. reported that branched SnO2 NW sensors have higher responses to ethanol than general SnO2 NW sensors . However, we believe that the Au catalyst previously deposited in the second growth step of SnO2 branches may have had a role in enhancing the gas sensing performance. This is likely the case with SnO2 NWs functionalized with nanoparticle catalysts . Recently, the gas sensing performance of ZnO NWs and hierarchical ZnO nanostructures were compared, and the gas response enhancement of the latter was established and explained . Since the gas sensing mechanisms of ZnO and SnO2 nanostructures are very similar, enhancement of the gas sensing performance of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to (i) higher porosity, (ii) more active centers obtained from enhanced oxygen vacancy defects, and (iii) junctions of the core and outer NWs/NBs. To clearly understand the enhancement of gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures, we first explain the gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs sensors. As depicted in Fig. 8 , when SnO2 NWs is exposed in air, oxygen molecules will adsorb on the surface and capture electrons from the conductance band of the NWs to become oxygen ions (active surface complexes). The adsorbed oxygen ions on the SnO2 NWs act as electron acceptors that generate a surface depletion region on the surface of the NWs. The width of the depletion region is sensitive to the ambient gases. As exposed to LPG and NH3 gas (donated electrons molecules), the reactions between these molecules and the active chemical complexes (oxygen ions) on the surface will lead to the release of the trapped electrons, resulting in a decrease of the depletion width. This leads to a decrease of the resistance of along the longitudinal SnO2 NWs. However, our SnO2 NWs sensors are a network type and there are many NWs bridge between the two Pt electrodes forming many networking points of SnO2\u2013SnO2 NWs (see Fig. 8(a)). The potential barrier around the networking points are blocked the electrons flow in a more efficient way compared with the depletion region on the surface. Because the barriers, with adjustable thickness and height, control the transport of electrons between the NWs through the equation : R=R0expe\u0394VbkbT\nIn this equation, \u0394V b is the change of the barrier potential defined as the potential in air minus that in target gas, R 0 is a factor including the resistance in air and other parameters, e is the charge of an electron, k b is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. When the sensors are exposed to LPG and NH3, not only the depletion width on the surface of the NWs, but also the height of the barrier potential at the networking point contact will decrease. From the schematic illustration of gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), we can clearly see that the hierarchical nanostructures have a higher porosity and more active sites compared to the SnO2 WNs sensor. More importantly, the hierarchical nanostructures sensor has much higher network point contacts (see Fig. 8(b)). This can be dominant factor in enhancing the gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures.\nFor practical applications, the response and recovery times of the gas sensors are very important concerns. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) shows the plots of the dynamic resistance responses of the three sensors to 1000 ppm LPG and 300 ppm NH3 gas, respectively. The 90% response time for gas exposure [t 90%(air-to-gas)] and that for recovery [t 90%(gas-to-air)] were calculated from the resistance-time data shown in Fig. 9. The t 90%(air-to-gas) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 4 and 17 s, respectively, whereas the t 90%(gas-to-air) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 9 and 30 s, respectively. For each of the gases, response and recovery times do not differ greatly from each other. These tests were performed at the corresponding optimal temperatures of the sensors, which may have contributed to the differences in values between the different gases.\nThis study demonstrated the use of a two-step thermal evaporation method in synthesizing hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures for gas sensing applications. Gas sensors fabricated from SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures were used to study and compare the gas sensing performance of the different nanostructures. Comparative gas sensing tests showed that hierarchical nanostructures exhibit enhanced gas sensing performance, which may be attributed to high porosity, more active sites, and addition of core\u2013outer junctions to the materials. Thus, synthesized hierarchically porous SnO2 nanostructures have a great potential for gas sensor applications, in addition to being used as photocatalysts and anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, this work provides a simple and controllable approach that can be extended to the synthesis of other hierarchical nanotructures based on metal oxide materials, such as SnO2, In2O3, ZnO, WO3, and TiO2."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nIn the pharmaceutical industry the early identification of toxicological side-effects of potential new drug candidates is of fundamental value in the minimisation of compound \u201cattrition\u201d . While specific assays have been developed to detect abnormal changes in biofluids of test animals, histopathological tissue examination remains the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 in toxicological assessment. Since investigating toxicity by traditional techniques is time consuming and costly, different approaches to the reliable and effective prediction of toxicity have been explored. Currently, there are several advanced technologies using multiparametric biochemical information derived from different levels of biomolecular organisation. Genomic and proteomic information describing transcriptional effects and protein synthesis can be extracted . However, these approaches are also slow and expensive. Alternatively, the metabonomic approach analyses the entire pool of endogenous metabolites in a biofluid or tissue, and is a powerful technique for detecting and describing biological endpoint-effects. It has already proven to be effective in the description of genetic strain differences, disease states, nutritional effects and toxic influences . In this study, we report the initial evaluation of metabonomic data yielded in a large-scale toxicological project within the COnsortium for MEtabonomic Toxicology (COMET). The COMET 1 project is currently constructing databases and metabolic models of drug toxicity using ca. 100,000 1H NMR spectra of biofluids from rats and mice treated with approximately 150 model compounds. Multivariate statistical models characterising the effects of toxins on endogenous metabolite profiles have been generated and will be used for the development of computer-based expert systems. These will enable rapid pre-clinical toxicological screening of potential drug candidates.\nAs a prototype for such large and comprehensive databases we have used a subset of the data to study dose- and time-related effects, to develop and evaluate classification methods and explore characteristic features of toxicity (the \u2018biomarker profile\u2019). This facilitates the prediction and interpretation of large-scale data sets and will help to hone the development of new analytical tools. We describe a first attempt to explore and predict the effect of different toxins, surgical procedures and other external influences in 19 independent studies using 1H NMR-metabonomic analysis of rat urine samples. Urine samples were collected from dosed and control rats at 10 time points over a period of 8 days and were subsequently analysed by 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data from the studies to reveal dose and time-related effects in the response of animals to different toxins. Finally, k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classification was used to predict how well individual samples were classified into their respective class and time point. This work gives an insight into the scope of this project and illustrates the diagnostic power and reliability of metabonomic data analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric techniques for the exploration and prediction of toxic effects.\nIn established in-house or external animal research facilities of the involved pharmaceutical companies, male 8\u201310 week old Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in metabolism cages and urine samples collected daily. Free access to food and water was permitted throughout the studies (except in the case of food and water restriction studies). The animals were randomly assigned to three dose groups: control (vehicle only, n=10), high-dose (dose causing a clear toxic effect, n=10) and low-dose (sub-toxic dose, n=10). For those studies without drug-treatment, classes were distinguished as follows: partial hepatectomy (L9), unilateral nephrectomy (K5), food restriction (O5): (1) 25%, (2) 50%, (3) 100% (for 1 day); 48 h water deprivation (O4).\nIn general, the animals were dosed or underwent surgery at 0 h. Urine samples were collected at \u221216 h (predose) (n=10) and 0 h (n=10), 8 h (n=10), 24 h (n=10), 48 h (n=10), 72 h (n=5), 96 h (n=5), 120 h (n=5), 144 h (n=5) and 168 h (n=5) postdose (p.d.) and stored at \u221240 \u00b0C. Half of the animals was euthanised at 48 h p.d., the other half at 168 h p.d. and organ tissue samples (liver (L), kidney (K) and in a small number of cases the pancreas) were submitted for histopathological examination (Table 1 ).\n1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out using an AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Analytische GmbH, Faellanden, Switzerland). Aliquots of each urine sample (400 \u03bcl) were added to 200 \u03bcl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4 in H2O and 0.2 M NaH2PO4 in 80:20 H2O:D2O, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) and 3 mM sodium azide. Samples were centrifuged at \u223c1800 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove any solid debris. 1H NMR spectra were measured at 300 K using a flow-injection system (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). NMR acquisition was performed using the first increment of a NOESY sequence with irradiation of the water frequence during the mixing time and relaxation delay. This resulted in a total acquisition time of \u223c4 min per sample.\nSpectra were automatically phase- and baseline-corrected and referenced to the chemical shift of TSP (\u03b4 = 0.0) using a Matlab routine (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) written in-house. Each NMR spectrum was reduced to 205 integrated regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the region \u03b4 = 0.2\u201310.0, excluding the region surrounding the water signal from \u03b4 = 4.50\u20135.98. All spectra were normalised to a constant integrated intensity of 100 units.\nExcretion of drug-related compounds into the urine can contribute to additional large signals in the 1H NMR spectra. These distort the scaling of spectra and give false classification results (as they are compound-related, not endogenous and show clear time- and dose-related concentration changes). In order to minimize the effect of drug-related signals in our study set of NMR spectra, the affected areas were treated according to a standard procedure as detailed in .\nMetabonomic changes in the urine samples were seen in the high-dose experiments and in some of the low-dose studies. For this first evaluation, only high-dose samples, where toxicity was confirmed by histopathology, and control samples (including predose samples) were compared.\nFour classification tasks were undertaken using the metabonomic sample data:\nClassification of samples according to organ-site specificity (liver, kidney or controls (C)).\nPrediction of organ-site specificity for a four-class system (liver, kidney, a further group comprising other (O) effects, or controls).\nPrediction of all samples into the individual studies.\nPrediction of the samples into their individual time points.\nFor most of the toxicological studies time points could be identified where the metabonomic urine profile changes significantly compared to controls. In order to classify the different studies, the selection of time points is vital. Studies can be either compared at the time point of maximum effect or at all time points showing an effect distinct from the control samples (Fig. 1 ). Both ways of characterising the study-specific differences were applied. In many of the studies a maximum effect could be observed at 48 h postdose (Table 1). Therefore, one particular comparison was carried out using the 48 h samples only.\nPrincipal component analysis and partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used in order to visualise the complex multivariate dataspace. Scores plots facilitated visualisation of the study-specific clustering of samples, while loadings plots revealed the characteristic underlying metabolic changes by showing the influence of the different spectral areas on the principal components (PCs). PCA and PLS-DA were performed using SIMCA-P 9.0 (Umetrics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden).\nHCA was applied to the data in order to detect intra- and inter-study similarities. In the individual studies, the spectral data at each time point significantly different from controls were averaged across animals and used for subsequent analysis. Centroidal linkage was chosen as the optimum linkage method, because it is less susceptible to effects of outliers and reduces problems due to overlap of clusters. HCA was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nClassification was accomplished using the kNN approach. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to obtain a first impression of the classification results. However, for \u201creal-life\u201d applications a classification with a training and test-set is more realistic. Therefore, a training and a test-set with approximately the same number of samples in each set (50:50) was built and prediction of those test data in the training data space was carried out. Subsequently, the training and test-set were exchanged and classification was repeated. The results from both runs were averaged. Error estimates were obtained from half the difference between the two results. The optimum neighbourhood parameters k were determined by repeating classification runs with different values of k. Those predictions with the lowest number of misclassifications gave the optimum neighbourhood parameter. kNN classification was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nThe complete dataset containing controls and samples taken at time points of significant metabonomic effect amounted to 2844 samples (2203 controls and predose samples, 641 samples postdose). As the controls were overweighted, 9 out of 10 control samples were randomly excluded, resulting in a dataset comprising 210 control urine samples, 328 samples from rats administered with a liver toxin, 145 samples from kidney toxin-treated rats and 168 samples from animals treated with other toxins or manipulations. Reduction of the data to include 48 h time points only resulted in 50 controls and 87, 50 and 60 urine samples after liver, kidney or other treatments, respectively.\nPCA of the averaged spectra at each time point gave a clear overview of the treatment- and time-related metabonomic effects as observed by NMR spectroscopy of the urine (Fig. 2 ). Separation of these data points can be attributed to alterations in NMR signals of endogenous urinary metabolites as seen in the loadings plot. Urines from streptozotocin-treated animals revealed a urinary metabolic profile distinct from all other treatment groups, mainly due to elevated glucose signals (\u03b4 = 3.4\u20133.88). Furthermore, the treatment with kidney toxins HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) resulted in common metabonomic effects, which were expected because both toxins cause tubular necrosis. Treatments resulting in a periportal liver lesion, such as the two groups of hydrazine-treated rats (L1, L2), are described by an increase in the scores for PC3 (due to an increase in e.g. taurine at \u03b4 = 3.28 and 2-aminoadipic acid at \u03b4 = 2.24, 1.64). Partial hepatectomy (L9), where entire liver lobes were removed, showed a similar increase in PC3, but still this group could be differentiated from L1 and L2. Other liver toxin groups, such as ANIT (L3, biliary, necrosis) and BHT (L5, centrilobular necrosis), showed opposite metabolic effects resulting in a decrease in PC3, and were well separated from hydrazine-induced liver toxicity.\nFig. 3 shows the best separation between controls (C), liver (L) and kidney (K) toxins using PLS-DA. It reveals that some samples from the kidney treatment group (K1, K3, K5) overlapped with samples from the liver treatment group. This most likely led to some misclassifications in the subsequent kNN classification runs. Many of the urines from the liver group clustered together and only L1 and L2 were significantly separated from the bulk of liver toxins. Late time points from studies L5 (BHT) and L9 (partial hepatectomy) overlapped with the control samples, suggesting that major effects in these studies were seen at early time points and that the urinary excretion profile at these later time points had returned close to normal. Finally, L1, L2 and K2, K4 showed the best separation between liver and kidney toxins as well as from control samples.\nHierarchical cluster analysis of the averaged spectra at each time point identified four main clusters (at a similarity level of approximately 0.7) (Fig. 4 ). Three of these clusters were composed of those studies showing the largest metabonomic effects: streptozotocin (O2) in one cluster, HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) in the second, and the two hydrazine studies (L1, L2) in the third cluster. This separation agreed well with the principal component analysis results.\nThe remaining cluster was separated into four distinct subgroups. The first subgroup contained samples from liver (L3, L5, L7) and kidney (K1, K3) dose groups. This especially highlights the aspect that some of the samples from the kidney toxin studies showed borderline-character between the classes liver and kidney, which was confirmed by the PLS-DA of control, liver and kidney samples (Fig. 3). One example is adriamycin (K1) which was assigned to the group of kidney toxins prior to analysis due to its predominant kidney toxicity, although slight histopathological liver effects were observed (decreased glycogen content). 2-Chloroethanamine (K3) was also found to show slight signs of liver toxicity (hepatitis, vacuolar degeneration and decreased glycogen). These findings indicate that the metabonomic analysis of urinary NMR data is sensitive to identifying toxin group similarities without detailed a priori knowledge of the histopathological characterisation. The second subgroup consisted entirely of samples from partially hepatectomised rats and indicated that although these samples showed some comparable effects to those of the hydrazine treatment group (Fig. 2), differences between the two were visible by HCA. The third sub-cluster consisted of predominantly liver treatment groups and two other studies (O3: chloroform, O5: food restriction). Chloroform induces both liver and kidney toxicity, while the food restriction study is likely to effect liver metabolism by glycogenolysis. The fourth subgroup was made up of mainly controls and control-like samples, e.g. late time points from treatment studies (K5, L5, L9). This emphasises the difference in time-response of animals to different toxins, i.e. onset and recovery. Those samples taken at a late time point from a study with an early recovery were more likely to show an excretion profile similar to control samples. Clustering of insulin (O1) into this subgroup indicates that the variance in the control cluster is larger than the subtle effects observed in the 8 h samples from insulin dosed animals. Overall, the analysis gives an asymmetric clustering structure with a strong tail. We attribute this appearance to the fact that many time points from several studies show a small effect, whereas fewer time points show stronger effects. For example, the first three clusters (studies O2, K2 & K4, L1 & L2) comprising 23 time points show the most prominent changes. Conversely, the fourth cluster, containing studies with weaker effects, is composed of 80 time points. This leads to \u2018overweighting\u2019 towards studies with smaller effects or even samples with high similarity to controls (mostly later time points in studies).\nHCA as an unsupervised technique not only identified clear organ-toxicity specific differences but also showed similarities between samples. The overlap between treatment groups helped to explain the misclassifications in the subsequent kNN analysis.\nThe most important goal in in vivo toxicity assessment is the determination of whether a drug is toxic, and subsequently which organ is affected. PCA, PLS-DA and especially HCA gave an impression of how well the different groups, defined by target organ, may be separated. Using the samples from the 19 studies taken at 48 h p.d., where the time point of maximum metabonomic effect was apparent in many of the studies, the classification into the three classes controls, liver and kidney resulted in greater than 85% correct prediction of the true class (Table 2 ) in LOO cross-validation using kNN. The best classification was achieved for the controls and liver treatment groups. Introducing a fourth class (other) led to a slight drop in correct classification of the control and liver group suggesting some misclassification into the other group. A total of 85% of the other group itself was predicted into the true class. As expected, it was more likely for those studies where the major metabonomic effect was seen at a different time point than 48 h to be misclassified as controls. This was true for the unilateral nephrectomy (K5) and the insulin treatment (O1) groups where major effects were only observed in the 8 h samples. Further reasons for misclassification were revealed in the HCA analysis, where studies from the other group (O3, O5) had close similarities to the liver group. In general, the use of training\u2013test-set (50:50) classification resulted in a slight reduction of 2\u20138% in the number of correct classification results compared to leave-one-out cross-validation, but provided a more robust model.\nThe importance of using the whole time-related urinary profile becomes obvious from the classification results obtained using all time points significantly different from controls (Table 3 ). Here, the classification of the samples resulted in a more even prediction success across the three groups (controls, liver, and kidney). LOO cross-validation resulted in greater than 90% true-class prediction. After introducing the other class, the correct prediction of the different classes in LOO cross-validation varied between 88 and 95% (training\u2013test-set classification: 85\u201391%).\nWith the exception of the liver group, all other classes showed an improvement from the use of more than one time point. The other group benefited from including the 8 h time point as this was important for the insulin study. In addition, the correct prediction of samples belonging to the kidney class increased due to the inclusion of the 8 h time point in study K5 (unilateral nephrectomy). Liver organ prediction was reduced (Table 4 ) due to the similarity of some of the late time points with control samples (L5, L9, see Fig. 4).\nIn general, our results for the organ-specific prediction suggest that the heterogeneity within the organ groups due to suborgan specific effects and different mechanisms of toxicity causes overlap between the groups. This will be taken into account while constructing larger databases. The use of a specific control model will ease the identification of important time points in the studies showing an effect compared to controls.\nTo investigate the next level of structure within the data, classifications were performed using each single toxicological study and the control samples as an individual class. Here, the study-by-study prediction employing all time points significantly different from controls (Table 5 ) was able to predict correctly the true class in 86% of cases using LOO cross-validation (81% for training\u2013test-set classification). Although the datasets analysed here have not been used to explore suborgan toxicity or toxic mechanisms specifically, the fact that each study can be clearly predicted as a separate class strongly suggests that such classification will be possible. We are currently exploring this aspect.\nAs a severe test, the division into subgroups can be pursued further so that the data is split into 87 classes where each class represents one treatment at one time point, plus one additional class for controls. With this time point-by-time point prediction (Table 5) the overall results for a correct time point prediction were between 64 and 67%, depending on the classification procedure. Fig. 5 illustrates the results from the training\u2013test-set prediction for every individual time point from the different studies. One axis shows the true class, the other axis those time points into which the samples were predicted (\u2018predicted class\u2019). The strong diagonal demonstrates that many of the samples were classified either into the correct time point of the right study, or into adjacent time points. This means that a sample which was not correctly classified into its time point was however closely predicted and mostly predicted into the right study. Reasons for misclassifications include the overlap between late time points from the treatment groups and control samples, and the similarity between the food restriction groups with 25 and 50% food reduction. As all time points from the studies together with controls amount to 88 classes, one would expect to assign a sample by chance to the correct class with a success rate of 1.1%, well below our success rates.\nSuccess of any prediction system will be determined by the selection of classes or subclasses and the number of samples in these classes. We are well aware that the ratio of samples in the different groups is an important aspect, and therefore we examined the impact of increasing the number of samples in the control group on the organ classification (48 h only). If the number of controls in our dataset was increased by approximately three-fold, the true-class prediction success for controls increased by 3% but this led to a decrease in classification success of 7% for the other group using LOO cross-validation. As this variance is due to strong overweighting, we expect our original dataset to be less affected.\nOur results show that the metabonomic approach of toxin prediction is highly competitive compared to other approaches using, e.g. genomic or proteomic information . Metabonomics has already proven useful in the description of liver and kidney toxicity using PCA and SIMCA . One application used probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to predict toxin-affected organs in two different rat strains at an overall success rate of 94% . For each strain, samples were predicted into five classes (liver, kidney, liver & kidney, mitochondrial toxins and controls). The use of more diverse classes, such as multiple-organ toxicity (liver & kidney), should lead to improved classification results, however, kidney toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats was correctly predicted with 7% lower success rate using PNNs than with our approach using four distinct classes. Our dataset also contained a higher number of samples per class which strengthens the confidence in our results. In addition, the authors used SIMCA and multi-layer perceptrons for comparison with PNNs. However, both techniques proved to be less successful. An analytical method called CLassification Of Unknowns by Density Superposition (CLOUDS) was developed within the COMET project and is also presented in these proceedings . We have demonstrated that this non-neural technique, derived from PNNs, gave similar results within the error range compared to the robust and well-known kNN method when applied to the same data set. This emphasises the reliability of both approaches. Furthermore, CLOUDS can be tailored to complex tasks using diagnostics such as confidence and uniqueness which gives further flexibility to its use in multiparametric analysis.\nThe application of proteomic techniques as yet has played a minor role in the prediction of toxicity despite its wider use in mechanistic toxicology , however the genomic approach of using gene expression data from tissues for predicting toxicity (toxicogenomics) is becoming increasingly popular . In such studies messenger RNA information is extracted from liver tissue samples after treatment with different liver toxins. The gene expression data from 15 hepatotoxins were examined with clustering techniques revealing several similarities between different groups of the toxins and their correlation to histopathology and clinical chemistry findings . A prediction accuracy of 92% for the prediction of two toxin classes (enzyme inducers and peroxisome proliferators) was achieved using an approach with linear discriminant analysis and genetic algorithms/kNN . We have shown that the metabonomic approach can be applied to more complex classification tasks. So far, the gene expression classifications are very much focused on liver toxicity and liver subgroup-toxicity . And, although gene expression analysis has shown reasonable results in the examination of liver toxins, it is very labour-intensive requiring lengthy tissue preparation and PCR amplification and the cost of the micro-arrays is also considerable. These reasons often reduce the applicability of the technique to only single time points in the course of a toxicological study. The NMR analysis of urine samples meanwhile is easy and quick to perform which allows an immediate analysis at every important stage within the time course of a study. It is non-destructive and gives access to a variety of metabolic pathways\u2014a big advantage for high-throughput screening for drug toxicity.\nAs part of a larger effort to construct a comprehensive database of urinary metabonomic data from toxicological investigations, these preliminary results have underlined the potential of our approach for the prediction of drug toxicity. Data were employed from animal studies showing metabonomic effects due to toxin administration, surgical procedures (partial hepatectomy, unilateral nephrectomy) and other treatments (food restriction, water deprivation). It was shown that chemometric methods such as PCA, PLS-DA and HCA are important tools in the exploration and visualisation of toxicological effects in the rat. These techniques improve the understanding of the structure of metabonomic databases regarding toxin-, organ-, suborgan- and time-specificity. Within the COMET project, methods of chemometric modelling of NMR-derived, metabonomic data from animal studies are being developed for the prediction of drug toxicity. Our results, employing kNN classification suggested a good predictability of liver and kidney toxicity and other effects. More comprehensive classification based on suborgan-sites or mechanisms of toxicity is currently being explored.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "In the pharmaceutical industry the early identification of toxicological side-effects of potential new drug candidates is of fundamental value in the minimisation of compound \u201cattrition\u201d . While specific assays have been developed to detect abnormal changes in biofluids of test animals, histopathological tissue examination remains the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 in toxicological assessment. Since investigating toxicity by traditional techniques is time consuming and costly, different approaches to the reliable and effective prediction of toxicity have been explored. Currently, there are several advanced technologies using multiparametric biochemical information derived from different levels of biomolecular organisation. Genomic and proteomic information describing transcriptional effects and protein synthesis can be extracted . However, these approaches are also slow and expensive. Alternatively, the metabonomic approach analyses the entire pool of endogenous metabolites in a biofluid or tissue, and is a powerful technique for detecting and describing biological endpoint-effects. It has already proven to be effective in the description of genetic strain differences, disease states, nutritional effects and toxic influences . In this study, we report the initial evaluation of metabonomic data yielded in a large-scale toxicological project within the COnsortium for MEtabonomic Toxicology (COMET). The COMET 1 project is currently constructing databases and metabolic models of drug toxicity using ca. 100,000 1H NMR spectra of biofluids from rats and mice treated with approximately 150 model compounds. Multivariate statistical models characterising the effects of toxins on endogenous metabolite profiles have been generated and will be used for the development of computer-based expert systems. These will enable rapid pre-clinical toxicological screening of potential drug candidates.\nAs a prototype for such large and comprehensive databases we have used a subset of the data to study dose- and time-related effects, to develop and evaluate classification methods and explore characteristic features of toxicity (the \u2018biomarker profile\u2019). This facilitates the prediction and interpretation of large-scale data sets and will help to hone the development of new analytical tools. We describe a first attempt to explore and predict the effect of different toxins, surgical procedures and other external influences in 19 independent studies using 1H NMR-metabonomic analysis of rat urine samples. Urine samples were collected from dosed and control rats at 10 time points over a period of 8 days and were subsequently analysed by 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data from the studies to reveal dose and time-related effects in the response of animals to different toxins. Finally, k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classification was used to predict how well individual samples were classified into their respective class and time point. This work gives an insight into the scope of this project and illustrates the diagnostic power and reliability of metabonomic data analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric techniques for the exploration and prediction of toxic effects.\nIn established in-house or external animal research facilities of the involved pharmaceutical companies, male 8\u201310 week old Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in metabolism cages and urine samples collected daily. Free access to food and water was permitted throughout the studies (except in the case of food and water restriction studies). The animals were randomly assigned to three dose groups: control (vehicle only, n=10), high-dose (dose causing a clear toxic effect, n=10) and low-dose (sub-toxic dose, n=10). For those studies without drug-treatment, classes were distinguished as follows: partial hepatectomy (L9), unilateral nephrectomy (K5), food restriction (O5): (1) 25%, (2) 50%, (3) 100% (for 1 day); 48 h water deprivation (O4).\nIn general, the animals were dosed or underwent surgery at 0 h. Urine samples were collected at \u221216 h (predose) (n=10) and 0 h (n=10), 8 h (n=10), 24 h (n=10), 48 h (n=10), 72 h (n=5), 96 h (n=5), 120 h (n=5), 144 h (n=5) and 168 h (n=5) postdose (p.d.) and stored at \u221240 \u00b0C. Half of the animals was euthanised at 48 h p.d., the other half at 168 h p.d. and organ tissue samples (liver (L), kidney (K) and in a small number of cases the pancreas) were submitted for histopathological examination (Table 1 ).\n1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out using an AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Analytische GmbH, Faellanden, Switzerland). Aliquots of each urine sample (400 \u03bcl) were added to 200 \u03bcl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4 in H2O and 0.2 M NaH2PO4 in 80:20 H2O:D2O, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) and 3 mM sodium azide. Samples were centrifuged at \u223c1800 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove any solid debris. 1H NMR spectra were measured at 300 K using a flow-injection system (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). NMR acquisition was performed using the first increment of a NOESY sequence with irradiation of the water frequence during the mixing time and relaxation delay. This resulted in a total acquisition time of \u223c4 min per sample.\nSpectra were automatically phase- and baseline-corrected and referenced to the chemical shift of TSP (\u03b4 = 0.0) using a Matlab routine (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) written in-house. Each NMR spectrum was reduced to 205 integrated regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the region \u03b4 = 0.2\u201310.0, excluding the region surrounding the water signal from \u03b4 = 4.50\u20135.98. All spectra were normalised to a constant integrated intensity of 100 units.\nExcretion of drug-related compounds into the urine can contribute to additional large signals in the 1H NMR spectra. These distort the scaling of spectra and give false classification results (as they are compound-related, not endogenous and show clear time- and dose-related concentration changes). In order to minimize the effect of drug-related signals in our study set of NMR spectra, the affected areas were treated according to a standard procedure as detailed in .\nMetabonomic changes in the urine samples were seen in the high-dose experiments and in some of the low-dose studies. For this first evaluation, only high-dose samples, where toxicity was confirmed by histopathology, and control samples (including predose samples) were compared.\nFour classification tasks were undertaken using the metabonomic sample data:\nClassification of samples according to organ-site specificity (liver, kidney or controls (C)).\nPrediction of organ-site specificity for a four-class system (liver, kidney, a further group comprising other (O) effects, or controls).\nPrediction of all samples into the individual studies.\nPrediction of the samples into their individual time points.\nFor most of the toxicological studies time points could be identified where the metabonomic urine profile changes significantly compared to controls. In order to classify the different studies, the selection of time points is vital. Studies can be either compared at the time point of maximum effect or at all time points showing an effect distinct from the control samples (Fig. 1 ). Both ways of characterising the study-specific differences were applied. In many of the studies a maximum effect could be observed at 48 h postdose (Table 1). Therefore, one particular comparison was carried out using the 48 h samples only.\nPrincipal component analysis and partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used in order to visualise the complex multivariate dataspace. Scores plots facilitated visualisation of the study-specific clustering of samples, while loadings plots revealed the characteristic underlying metabolic changes by showing the influence of the different spectral areas on the principal components (PCs). PCA and PLS-DA were performed using SIMCA-P 9.0 (Umetrics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden).\nHCA was applied to the data in order to detect intra- and inter-study similarities. In the individual studies, the spectral data at each time point significantly different from controls were averaged across animals and used for subsequent analysis. Centroidal linkage was chosen as the optimum linkage method, because it is less susceptible to effects of outliers and reduces problems due to overlap of clusters. HCA was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nClassification was accomplished using the kNN approach. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to obtain a first impression of the classification results. However, for \u201creal-life\u201d applications a classification with a training and test-set is more realistic. Therefore, a training and a test-set with approximately the same number of samples in each set (50:50) was built and prediction of those test data in the training data space was carried out. Subsequently, the training and test-set were exchanged and classification was repeated. The results from both runs were averaged. Error estimates were obtained from half the difference between the two results. The optimum neighbourhood parameters k were determined by repeating classification runs with different values of k. Those predictions with the lowest number of misclassifications gave the optimum neighbourhood parameter. kNN classification was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nThe complete dataset containing controls and samples taken at time points of significant metabonomic effect amounted to 2844 samples (2203 controls and predose samples, 641 samples postdose). As the controls were overweighted, 9 out of 10 control samples were randomly excluded, resulting in a dataset comprising 210 control urine samples, 328 samples from rats administered with a liver toxin, 145 samples from kidney toxin-treated rats and 168 samples from animals treated with other toxins or manipulations. Reduction of the data to include 48 h time points only resulted in 50 controls and 87, 50 and 60 urine samples after liver, kidney or other treatments, respectively.\nPCA of the averaged spectra at each time point gave a clear overview of the treatment- and time-related metabonomic effects as observed by NMR spectroscopy of the urine (Fig. 2 ). Separation of these data points can be attributed to alterations in NMR signals of endogenous urinary metabolites as seen in the loadings plot. Urines from streptozotocin-treated animals revealed a urinary metabolic profile distinct from all other treatment groups, mainly due to elevated glucose signals (\u03b4 = 3.4\u20133.88). Furthermore, the treatment with kidney toxins HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) resulted in common metabonomic effects, which were expected because both toxins cause tubular necrosis. Treatments resulting in a periportal liver lesion, such as the two groups of hydrazine-treated rats (L1, L2), are described by an increase in the scores for PC3 (due to an increase in e.g. taurine at \u03b4 = 3.28 and 2-aminoadipic acid at \u03b4 = 2.24, 1.64). Partial hepatectomy (L9), where entire liver lobes were removed, showed a similar increase in PC3, but still this group could be differentiated from L1 and L2. Other liver toxin groups, such as ANIT (L3, biliary, necrosis) and BHT (L5, centrilobular necrosis), showed opposite metabolic effects resulting in a decrease in PC3, and were well separated from hydrazine-induced liver toxicity.\nFig. 3 shows the best separation between controls (C), liver (L) and kidney (K) toxins using PLS-DA. It reveals that some samples from the kidney treatment group (K1, K3, K5) overlapped with samples from the liver treatment group. This most likely led to some misclassifications in the subsequent kNN classification runs. Many of the urines from the liver group clustered together and only L1 and L2 were significantly separated from the bulk of liver toxins. Late time points from studies L5 (BHT) and L9 (partial hepatectomy) overlapped with the control samples, suggesting that major effects in these studies were seen at early time points and that the urinary excretion profile at these later time points had returned close to normal. Finally, L1, L2 and K2, K4 showed the best separation between liver and kidney toxins as well as from control samples.\nHierarchical cluster analysis of the averaged spectra at each time point identified four main clusters (at a similarity level of approximately 0.7) (Fig. 4 ). Three of these clusters were composed of those studies showing the largest metabonomic effects: streptozotocin (O2) in one cluster, HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) in the second, and the two hydrazine studies (L1, L2) in the third cluster. This separation agreed well with the principal component analysis results.\nThe remaining cluster was separated into four distinct subgroups. The first subgroup contained samples from liver (L3, L5, L7) and kidney (K1, K3) dose groups. This especially highlights the aspect that some of the samples from the kidney toxin studies showed borderline-character between the classes liver and kidney, which was confirmed by the PLS-DA of control, liver and kidney samples (Fig. 3). One example is adriamycin (K1) which was assigned to the group of kidney toxins prior to analysis due to its predominant kidney toxicity, although slight histopathological liver effects were observed (decreased glycogen content). 2-Chloroethanamine (K3) was also found to show slight signs of liver toxicity (hepatitis, vacuolar degeneration and decreased glycogen). These findings indicate that the metabonomic analysis of urinary NMR data is sensitive to identifying toxin group similarities without detailed a priori knowledge of the histopathological characterisation. The second subgroup consisted entirely of samples from partially hepatectomised rats and indicated that although these samples showed some comparable effects to those of the hydrazine treatment group (Fig. 2), differences between the two were visible by HCA. The third sub-cluster consisted of predominantly liver treatment groups and two other studies (O3: chloroform, O5: food restriction). Chloroform induces both liver and kidney toxicity, while the food restriction study is likely to effect liver metabolism by glycogenolysis. The fourth subgroup was made up of mainly controls and control-like samples, e.g. late time points from treatment studies (K5, L5, L9). This emphasises the difference in time-response of animals to different toxins, i.e. onset and recovery. Those samples taken at a late time point from a study with an early recovery were more likely to show an excretion profile similar to control samples. Clustering of insulin (O1) into this subgroup indicates that the variance in the control cluster is larger than the subtle effects observed in the 8 h samples from insulin dosed animals. Overall, the analysis gives an asymmetric clustering structure with a strong tail. We attribute this appearance to the fact that many time points from several studies show a small effect, whereas fewer time points show stronger effects. For example, the first three clusters (studies O2, K2 & K4, L1 & L2) comprising 23 time points show the most prominent changes. Conversely, the fourth cluster, containing studies with weaker effects, is composed of 80 time points. This leads to \u2018overweighting\u2019 towards studies with smaller effects or even samples with high similarity to controls (mostly later time points in studies).\nHCA as an unsupervised technique not only identified clear organ-toxicity specific differences but also showed similarities between samples. The overlap between treatment groups helped to explain the misclassifications in the subsequent kNN analysis.\nThe most important goal in in vivo toxicity assessment is the determination of whether a drug is toxic, and subsequently which organ is affected. PCA, PLS-DA and especially HCA gave an impression of how well the different groups, defined by target organ, may be separated. Using the samples from the 19 studies taken at 48 h p.d., where the time point of maximum metabonomic effect was apparent in many of the studies, the classification into the three classes controls, liver and kidney resulted in greater than 85% correct prediction of the true class (Table 2 ) in LOO cross-validation using kNN. The best classification was achieved for the controls and liver treatment groups. Introducing a fourth class (other) led to a slight drop in correct classification of the control and liver group suggesting some misclassification into the other group. A total of 85% of the other group itself was predicted into the true class. As expected, it was more likely for those studies where the major metabonomic effect was seen at a different time point than 48 h to be misclassified as controls. This was true for the unilateral nephrectomy (K5) and the insulin treatment (O1) groups where major effects were only observed in the 8 h samples. Further reasons for misclassification were revealed in the HCA analysis, where studies from the other group (O3, O5) had close similarities to the liver group. In general, the use of training\u2013test-set (50:50) classification resulted in a slight reduction of 2\u20138% in the number of correct classification results compared to leave-one-out cross-validation, but provided a more robust model.\nThe importance of using the whole time-related urinary profile becomes obvious from the classification results obtained using all time points significantly different from controls (Table 3 ). Here, the classification of the samples resulted in a more even prediction success across the three groups (controls, liver, and kidney). LOO cross-validation resulted in greater than 90% true-class prediction. After introducing the other class, the correct prediction of the different classes in LOO cross-validation varied between 88 and 95% (training\u2013test-set classification: 85\u201391%).\nWith the exception of the liver group, all other classes showed an improvement from the use of more than one time point. The other group benefited from including the 8 h time point as this was important for the insulin study. In addition, the correct prediction of samples belonging to the kidney class increased due to the inclusion of the 8 h time point in study K5 (unilateral nephrectomy). Liver organ prediction was reduced (Table 4 ) due to the similarity of some of the late time points with control samples (L5, L9, see Fig. 4).\nIn general, our results for the organ-specific prediction suggest that the heterogeneity within the organ groups due to suborgan specific effects and different mechanisms of toxicity causes overlap between the groups. This will be taken into account while constructing larger databases. The use of a specific control model will ease the identification of important time points in the studies showing an effect compared to controls.\nTo investigate the next level of structure within the data, classifications were performed using each single toxicological study and the control samples as an individual class. Here, the study-by-study prediction employing all time points significantly different from controls (Table 5 ) was able to predict correctly the true class in 86% of cases using LOO cross-validation (81% for training\u2013test-set classification). Although the datasets analysed here have not been used to explore suborgan toxicity or toxic mechanisms specifically, the fact that each study can be clearly predicted as a separate class strongly suggests that such classification will be possible. We are currently exploring this aspect.\nAs a severe test, the division into subgroups can be pursued further so that the data is split into 87 classes where each class represents one treatment at one time point, plus one additional class for controls. With this time point-by-time point prediction (Table 5) the overall results for a correct time point prediction were between 64 and 67%, depending on the classification procedure. Fig. 5 illustrates the results from the training\u2013test-set prediction for every individual time point from the different studies. One axis shows the true class, the other axis those time points into which the samples were predicted (\u2018predicted class\u2019). The strong diagonal demonstrates that many of the samples were classified either into the correct time point of the right study, or into adjacent time points. This means that a sample which was not correctly classified into its time point was however closely predicted and mostly predicted into the right study. Reasons for misclassifications include the overlap between late time points from the treatment groups and control samples, and the similarity between the food restriction groups with 25 and 50% food reduction. As all time points from the studies together with controls amount to 88 classes, one would expect to assign a sample by chance to the correct class with a success rate of 1.1%, well below our success rates.\nSuccess of any prediction system will be determined by the selection of classes or subclasses and the number of samples in these classes. We are well aware that the ratio of samples in the different groups is an important aspect, and therefore we examined the impact of increasing the number of samples in the control group on the organ classification (48 h only). If the number of controls in our dataset was increased by approximately three-fold, the true-class prediction success for controls increased by 3% but this led to a decrease in classification success of 7% for the other group using LOO cross-validation. As this variance is due to strong overweighting, we expect our original dataset to be less affected.\nOur results show that the metabonomic approach of toxin prediction is highly competitive compared to other approaches using, e.g. genomic or proteomic information . Metabonomics has already proven useful in the description of liver and kidney toxicity using PCA and SIMCA . One application used probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to predict toxin-affected organs in two different rat strains at an overall success rate of 94% . For each strain, samples were predicted into five classes (liver, kidney, liver & kidney, mitochondrial toxins and controls). The use of more diverse classes, such as multiple-organ toxicity (liver & kidney), should lead to improved classification results, however, kidney toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats was correctly predicted with 7% lower success rate using PNNs than with our approach using four distinct classes. Our dataset also contained a higher number of samples per class which strengthens the confidence in our results. In addition, the authors used SIMCA and multi-layer perceptrons for comparison with PNNs. However, both techniques proved to be less successful. An analytical method called CLassification Of Unknowns by Density Superposition (CLOUDS) was developed within the COMET project and is also presented in these proceedings . We have demonstrated that this non-neural technique, derived from PNNs, gave similar results within the error range compared to the robust and well-known kNN method when applied to the same data set. This emphasises the reliability of both approaches. Furthermore, CLOUDS can be tailored to complex tasks using diagnostics such as confidence and uniqueness which gives further flexibility to its use in multiparametric analysis.\nThe application of proteomic techniques as yet has played a minor role in the prediction of toxicity despite its wider use in mechanistic toxicology , however the genomic approach of using gene expression data from tissues for predicting toxicity (toxicogenomics) is becoming increasingly popular . In such studies messenger RNA information is extracted from liver tissue samples after treatment with different liver toxins. The gene expression data from 15 hepatotoxins were examined with clustering techniques revealing several similarities between different groups of the toxins and their correlation to histopathology and clinical chemistry findings . A prediction accuracy of 92% for the prediction of two toxin classes (enzyme inducers and peroxisome proliferators) was achieved using an approach with linear discriminant analysis and genetic algorithms/kNN . We have shown that the metabonomic approach can be applied to more complex classification tasks. So far, the gene expression classifications are very much focused on liver toxicity and liver subgroup-toxicity . And, although gene expression analysis has shown reasonable results in the examination of liver toxins, it is very labour-intensive requiring lengthy tissue preparation and PCR amplification and the cost of the micro-arrays is also considerable. These reasons often reduce the applicability of the technique to only single time points in the course of a toxicological study. The NMR analysis of urine samples meanwhile is easy and quick to perform which allows an immediate analysis at every important stage within the time course of a study. It is non-destructive and gives access to a variety of metabolic pathways\u2014a big advantage for high-throughput screening for drug toxicity.\nAs part of a larger effort to construct a comprehensive database of urinary metabonomic data from toxicological investigations, these preliminary results have underlined the potential of our approach for the prediction of drug toxicity. Data were employed from animal studies showing metabonomic effects due to toxin administration, surgical procedures (partial hepatectomy, unilateral nephrectomy) and other treatments (food restriction, water deprivation). It was shown that chemometric methods such as PCA, PLS-DA and HCA are important tools in the exploration and visualisation of toxicological effects in the rat. These techniques improve the understanding of the structure of metabonomic databases regarding toxin-, organ-, suborgan- and time-specificity. Within the COMET project, methods of chemometric modelling of NMR-derived, metabonomic data from animal studies are being developed for the prediction of drug toxicity. Our results, employing kNN classification suggested a good predictability of liver and kidney toxicity and other effects. More comprehensive classification based on suborgan-sites or mechanisms of toxicity is currently being explored."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nRecently, PDMS has become a highly attractive material for microfluidic chips because of its ease of fabrication. Unfortunately, for protein analysis, the hydrophobicity of the PDMS surface causes strong adsorption of proteins. Current methods to reduce protein binding include polymer grafting, biopassivation using an antibody\u2013neutravidin\u2013dextran coating, lipid bilayer formation on a plasma-oxidized PDMS surface, and coating with poly(vinyl alcohol). These methods have the drawback that either the treatment procedure is complex or the adsorption reduction (100\u20131000 fold) is not sufficient for some high sensitivity applications.\nn-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) is an alkyl polyglucoside, which belongs to a family of very mild nonionic surfactants. It adsorbs strongly on hydrophobic surfaces, such as graphite, and forms a monolayer. This monolayer coverage causes the surface to become hydrophilic and nonionic, thus reducing the interaction between the protein and the surface. Because alkyl polyglucosides do not affect the functionality of many proteins, which has been demonstrated by solublizing proteins without denaturation, we can keep a certain concentration of DDM in the solution so that it equilibrates with the adsorbed surfactant molecules. Dynamic coating with ionic reagents has been used to change the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in PDMS channels. For nonionic surfactants, Towns and Regnier have demonstrated that the dynamic coating of alkylsilane-modified silica capillaries with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based surfactant reduces the surface adsorption of analyte proteins in capillary electrophoresis. This result suggested to us that a DDM coating could be efficient in reducing protein nonspecific binding on the hydrophobic PDMS surface.\nTo monitor the protein adsorption, we use fluorescence imaging either with epifluorescence, wide-field excitation, or with total internal reflection (TIR) excitation. We use 1 \u00b5M Alexa Fluor 647 labeled streptavidin or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Hepes buffered saline (HBS) containing 20 mM Hepes and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.5. For achieving a dynamic DDM coating, we use HBS with 0.1% DDM, which we refer to as DHBS. The protein solution in HBS or DHBS is injected into a 100 \u00b5m high \u00d7 1 mm wide \u00d7 25 mm long rectangular PDMS channel and then removed with HBS or DHBS after an incubation time of 5 min. The buffer washing is performed either (1) by flushing 50 \u00b5L buffer in about 2.5 s with a pipet or (2) by flowing buffer at 1 mL h\u22121 for 3 min (50 \u00b5L), which results in almost identical surface fluorescence (Table 1).\nWithout DDM in the buffer, both streptavidin and BSA adsorb strongly to the PDMS surface, yielding bright, homogeneous fluorescence emission at low excitation power (0.15 W cm\u22122 at the sample) (Figs. 1A and D). In contrast, with DHBS, only scattered fluorescent spots can be observed under much higher excitation power (8.9 W cm\u22122) and TIR excitation (Figs. 1B and E). Stepwise photobleaching of these spots can be observed (Fig. 1F). As a control, a PDMS surface treated with DHBS does not show significant fluorescence under the same excitation conditions (Fig. 1C). According to the manufacturer, the sample proteins are labeled with an average of about three dye molecules per protein. We conclude that these fluorescent spots are actually individual protein molecules. Therefore, with DDM dynamic coating, the nonspecific binding of streptavidin and BSA on PDMS is almost completely eliminated (an estimated 106 fold reduction) without any separate surface treatment.\nWe have also tested the effect of 0.1% DDM on reducing the surface adsorption of cytochrome c, an antibody (mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody), and a transmembrane protein (\u03b22 adrenergic receptor), all of which show scattered molecules on the surface even with high protein concentration, while maintaining the activity of each protein. Thus, DDM dynamic coating can be applied to a wide variety of systems in which the presence of a small percentage of DDM can be tolerated.\nIn a few situations, DDM in the buffer solution could still affect adversely the experimental system, suggesting the use of a permanent coating. Geffroy et al. have shown that PEG-based nonionic surfactants remain adsorbed onto the hydrophobic polystyrene surface after removing surfactants in the solution, which is attributed to the strong hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain and the surface. Because of the structural similarity, we expected that DDM should also irreversibly adsorb to PDMS.\nTo test the permanent coating of the PDMS surface with DDM, the PDMS channel is incubated with DHBS for 5 min and then washed either with pipet flushing (50 \u00b5L HBS) or with constant flow (1 mL h\u22121). The channel is subsequently incubated with protein/HBS solution for 5 min and then washed with HBS. In the case of pipet flushing, the amount of streptavidin bound to the PDMS surface is reduced by a factor of 102 (Table 1). With the other method, we have found that longer washing times favor the reduction of protein adsorption. As can be seen in Fig. 2, extending the washing time from 2.5 min to 10 min reduces the nonspecifically bound streptavidin to the single molecule level. Further increase in washing time up to 1 h does not significantly change the binding of streptavidin or BSA, indicating that the DDM coating is stable.\nWe find continuous washing is necessary for efficient DDM coating. For example, after pipet washing, if we incubate the channel with HBS for 1 h without flowing, the streptavidin adsorption is only slightly lower than the case without such incubation (Table 1). This phenomenon might be caused by the same mechanism as the desorption behavior of PEG surfactants observed by Geffroy et al., in which it takes about 5 min for the surface-bound surfactants to desorb and equilibrate with the buffer. Thus, continuous washing would be able to remove the DDM molecules that are desorbed from the surface and allows DDM on the surface to rearrange its configuration. The exact mechanism is under investigation.\nIn addition to its ability to suppress protein adsorption, the DDM coating also reduces the EOF by covering the charges on the PDMS surface. Our measurements using current monitoring method show that the electroosmotic mobility of 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) in a PDMS channel is reduced from 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 to 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (dynamic coating) or 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (permanent coating). Such EOF reduction is beneficial in many cases.\nIn conclusion, DDM coating, dynamic or permanent, is a simple, but highly efficient method to minimize protein adsorption to a PDMS surface. The hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain of DDM and the PDMS surface promotes binding and causes the resulting surface to be passivated. We propose that DDM coating might become a general procedure for reducing nonspecific protein adsorption on other hydrophobic surfaces, such as alkylsilane-modified silica surfaces and alkylthiol-modified gold surfaces.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

The buffer washing is performed either (1) by flushing 50 \u00b5L buffer in about 2.5 s with a pipet or (2) by flowing buffer at 1 mL h\u22121 for 3 min (50 \u00b5L), which results in almost identical surface fluorescence (Table 1).\nWithout DDM in the buffer, both streptavidin and BSA adsorb strongly to the PDMS surface, yielding bright, homogeneous fluorescence emission at low excitation power (0.15 W cm\u22122 at the sample) (Figs. 1A and D). In contrast, with DHBS, only scattered fluorescent spots can be observed under much higher excitation power (8.9 W cm\u22122) and TIR excitation (Figs. 1B and E). Stepwise photobleaching of these spots can be observed (Fig. 1F). As a control, a PDMS surface treated with DHBS does not show significant fluorescence under the same excitation conditions (Fig. 1C). According to the manufacturer, the sample proteins are labeled with an average of about three dye molecules per protein. We conclude that these fluorescent spots are actually individual protein molecules. Therefore, with DDM dynamic coating, the nonspecific binding of streptavidin and BSA on PDMS is almost completely eliminated (an estimated 106 fold reduction) without any separate surface treatment.\nWe have also tested the effect of 0.1% DDM on reducing the surface adsorption of cytochrome c, an antibody (mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody), and a transmembrane protein (\u03b22 adrenergic receptor), all of which show scattered molecules on the surface even with high protein concentration, while maintaining the activity of each protein. Thus, DDM dynamic coating can be applied to a wide variety of systems in which the presence of a small percentage of DDM can be tolerated.\nIn a few situations, DDM in the buffer solution could still affect adversely the experimental system, suggesting the use of a permanent coating. Geffroy et al. have shown that PEG-based nonionic surfactants remain adsorbed onto the hydrophobic polystyrene surface after removing surfactants in the solution, which is attributed to the strong hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain and the surface. Because of the structural similarity, we expected that DDM should also irreversibly adsorb to PDMS.\nTo test the permanent coating of the PDMS surface with DDM, the PDMS channel is incubated with DHBS for 5 min and then washed either with pipet flushing (50 \u00b5L HBS) or with constant flow (1 mL h\u22121). The channel is subsequently incubated with protein/HBS solution for 5 min and then washed with HBS. In the case of pipet flushing, the amount of streptavidin bound to the PDMS surface is reduced by a factor of 102 (Table 1). With the other method, we have found that longer washing times favor the reduction of protein adsorption. As can be seen in Fig. 2, extending the washing time from 2.5 min to 10 min reduces the nonspecifically bound streptavidin to the single molecule level. Further increase in washing time up to 1 h does not significantly change the binding of streptavidin or BSA, indicating that the DDM coating is stable.\nWe find continuous washing is necessary for efficient DDM coating. For example, after pipet washing, if we incubate the channel with HBS for 1 h without flowing, the streptavidin adsorption is only slightly lower than the case without such incubation (Table 1). This phenomenon might be caused by the same mechanism as the desorption behavior of PEG surfactants observed by Geffroy et al., in which it takes about 5 min for the surface-bound surfactants to desorb and equilibrate with the buffer. Thus, continuous washing would be able to remove the DDM molecules that are desorbed from the surface and allows DDM on the surface to rearrange its configuration. The exact mechanism is under investigation.\nIn addition to its ability to suppress protein adsorption, the DDM coating also reduces the EOF by covering the charges on the PDMS surface. Our measurements using current monitoring method show that the electroosmotic mobility of 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) in a PDMS channel is reduced from 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 to 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (dynamic coating) or 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (permanent coating). Such EOF reduction is beneficial in many cases.\nIn conclusion, DDM coating, dynamic or permanent, is a simple, but highly efficient method to minimize protein adsorption to a PDMS surface. The hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain of DDM and the PDMS surface promotes binding and causes the resulting surface to be passivated. We propose that DDM coating might become a general procedure for reducing nonspecific protein adsorption on other hydrophobic surfaces, such as alkylsilane-modified silica surfaces and alkylthiol-modified gold surfaces."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nAromatic amines, such as aniline and its substituted derivatives, are generally dangerous because of their toxicity and carcinogenicity or else they can be converted into toxic N-nitroso compounds through reactions with nitrosylating agents in the environment . These contaminants may be released as chemical residues of dyestuffs, cosmetics, medicines and rubber manufacture and also as by-products of energy technologies such as coal-conversion waste processing . Chlorinated anilines such as p-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline were also found as degradation products and intermediates of various phenylurea and phenylcarbamate pesticides . In view of the importance of these compounds, a rapid and sensitive method of analysis is needed to detect them in the environment.\nSeveral methods have been developed for the determination of anilines in environmental samples. Gas chromatography (GC) is a classical method , and presently GC\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) is often used . For non-volatile aniline compounds high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may be used with fluorescence detection after derivatization , or with amperometric detection . Some sample preparation techniques have been reported for the pretreatment of anilines in aqueous samples based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) . In the past years, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has emerged as a versatile solvent-free alternative to SPE procedures. In recent years, a novel technique termed liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) has been developed. However a fast simple preconcentration and microextraction method, DLLME has been presented in 2006 for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and chlorobenzenes (CBs) in water samples and for the first time, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization combined with gas chromatography-electroncapture detection (GC-ECD) were studied for the analysis of 19 chlorophenols (CPs) in water samples . In this method, the appropriate mixture of extraction solvent and disperser solvent are injected into the aqueous sample (5 ml) by syringe, rapidly. Therefore, cloudy solution is formed. In fact, it is consisted of fine particles of extraction solvent which is dispersed entirely into aqueous phase. After centrifuging, the fine particles of extraction solvent are sedimented in the bottom of the conical test tube. The advantages of DLLME method are simplicity of operation, rapidity, low-cost, high-recovery, and enrichment factor.\nIn the present work, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization have been carried out in one-step for the analysis of anilines in water samples at the sub-ppb level and various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were also investigated in this study.\nAll chemicals used in this study were reagent grade, aniline and 4-chloroaniline were obtained (purity > 99%) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline were purchased (purity \u2267 98%) from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Portugal). Derivatization reagent pentafluorobenzaldehyde (PFBAY) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA), chlorobenzene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachloroethylene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachlorocarbon (Showa Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), acetone (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan), acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), and methanol (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan) were also used for this study.\nThe stock solutions were prepared by adding approximately 3 mg of analytes into vials and diluted to 10 ml with methanol. The stock solutions were kept storage at 4 \u00b0C. Before extraction, stock solutions were diluted with blank stream water to aqueous standard of 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) for the optimization experiments. A waste water from Tou Cian stream (Hsinchu, Taiwan) served as the environmental sample.\nAnalysis was carried-out using a gas chromatograph Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 6850 with split/splitless injector operated at 250 \u00b0C in pulse splitless mode (1 min), mass detector Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 5978B. A 30 m HP-5MS (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness) was used for separation. The column oven was initially held at 70 \u00b0C, raised to 295 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, held at 295 \u00b0C for 1 min. The carrier gas was helium (purity 99.9995%); it was further purified by passage through a superior helium gas purifier Agilent (Wilmington, DE, USA) model RMSH-2. A Sorvall 5C Plus Centrifuge (Global Medical, Ramsey, MN, USA) was used.\nAll of the 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tubes (extraction vessel) were manufactured by Ching Fa glass factory (Hsingchu, Taiwan).\nDeionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q (Millipore, MA, USA) purification system.\nIn the simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, an aliquot of 5 ml of a blank stream solution containing 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) was placed in a 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tube. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of acetone (disperser solvent) containing 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene (extraction solvent) and 10 \u03bcl methanol containing PFBAY (30 g/l, derivatization reagent) was injected rapidly into the aqueous solution with a 1 ml syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and a 10 \u03bcl syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA), then the mentioned mixture was kept in a water bath (30 \u00b0C). Dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution. In this step, anilines and PFBAY were extracted into the fine droplet of chlorobenzene rapidly and derivatized in the chlorobenzene, in 20 min. After centrifugation for 2 min at 6000 rpm, fine droplets of extraction solvent were sedimented at the bottom of the conical test tube. The volume of the sedimented phase was determined to approximately 2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl. The sedimented phase (2 \u03bcl) was injected into GC for separation and analysis.\nFor evaluating the pretreatment procedure, the sensitivities of two experiments were compared. In the first experiment, derivatization reagent was added to aqueous sample containing anilines to proceed derivative reaction for 20 min, then 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was injected into above aqueous sample and then the centrifugation was proceeded in 2 min. In the second experiment, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene and derivatization reagent were injected into aqueous sample spiked with anilines, and then centrifugation was proceeded after 20 min. As shown in Fig. 1 , better sensitivity was obtained, except for 3,5-dichloroaniline with similar sensitivity, with simultaneous DLLME and derivatization. It was inferred that difference of sensitivity of anilines between experiment 1 and 2 should be affected by the solubility of anilines in water (Table 1 ) . Therefore simultaneous derivatization and extraction was decided to be the pretreatment procedure.\nIn DLLME method, some characteristics of extraction solvent such as low solubility in water, extraction capability of interested compounds, good chromatographic behavior and higher density than water must be achieved. Thus there are extra limitations on the selection of extraction solvent in DLLME method. Most of the halogenated solvents own above properties.\nTo obtain the better extraction efficiency, chlorobenzene, tetrachloroethylene, and tetrachlorocarbon were tested as extraction solvents. A 5 ml of aqueous sample containing the target compounds were extracted using the procedure described above.\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , the extraction efficiency of aniline and 4-chloroaniline extracted with tetrachlorocarbon were higher than other solvents but from the view of average sensitivity for these four analytes, chlorobenzene was selected as the extraction solvent.\nDisperser solvent should be miscible in water; also it should dissolve the extraction solvent. Thus acetone and acetonitrile were selected as disperser solvents to investigate the effect of these solvents on the performance of DLLME.\nWhen acetone and acetonitrile were tested as disperser solvents containing chlorobenzene to inject into aqueous sample, as shown in the following result (Fig. 3 ), extraction efficiency of acetone was similar to acetonitrile but acetone was less toxic, referred with LC50, than acetonitrile . Consequently, the acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxicity and cheaper.\nFor investigating the effect of volume of disperser solvent on extraction efficiency, various volumes of acetone (0.5, 1, 1.5 ml) containing (10, 13, 16.5 \u03bcl) chlorobenzene were performed, respectively. Increasing the volume of chlorobenzene by increasing the volume of acetone is required to obtain the constant volume of the sedimented phase (3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl). As shown in Fig. 4 , the optimized sensitivity was achieved when 0.5 ml acetone and 10 \u03bcl of chlorobenzene were used.\nIncreasing extraction solvent would increase extracted amount of analytes, however the concentration of analytes in the sedimented phase were also diluted. For enhancing sensitivity, 2 \u03bcl of sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS. Over 2 \u03bcl of injection would cause peak broaden. Here 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent was used to study for obtaining the effect of 2 and 3 \u03bcl of sedimented phase on extraction efficiency. There is no considerable change on the extraction efficiency of these anilines between 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent. Consequently, 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was selected.\nIn this work, the matrices in the river water would influence derivatization and extraction efficiency. Here, different pH values (4, 4.6, 5, 7.8) in sample solution were adjusted to investigate the derivatization and extraction efficiency. The lower sensitivity of stream water (pH 7.8) was observed. Higher sensitivity was acquired as lowering pH value, however sensitivity descended below pH 4.6. As shown in Fig. 5 , the better derivatization and extraction efficiency would be obtained at pH 4.6.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, raising temperature would cause different derivatization performance and solubility of analytes in aqueous. Here, various extraction and derivatization temperatures were investigated to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6 , the sensitivity decreased by increasing extraction and derivatization temperature from 30 to 60 \u00b0C. Thus 30 \u00b0C was used for further study.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution and the surface area between extraction solvent and aqueous phase (water sample) is very large. Transition of anilines and PFBAY from aqueous phase (water sample) to extraction solvent is fast enough to let a quick achieve of the equilibrium state. Thereby, most of the required time was for derivatization of anilines with PFBAY.\nVarious experiments were performed in the range of 0\u201350 min to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7 , there is no considerable change on the sensitivity of these anilines after 20 min and 20 min was selected for extraction and derivatization time.\nThe characteristics of analytes were listed in Table 2 . Enrichment factors, which were defined as formula 1, achieved by the DLLME procedure were 212\u2013645-fold. The linearity of the DLLME for blank water samples of anilines detected by GC\u2013MS was investigated with spiked concentrations of analytes ranging from 0.25 to 70 \u03bcg/l; and method detection limits (MDLs), which were calculated as three times the standard deviation of five replicated runs of spiked samples at lowest concentration of calibration curve, were in the range 0.04\u20130.09 \u03bcg/l. Correlation coefficients, (R 2) values, were between 0.9955 and 0.9985. Linear equation was used to calculate R 2 for GC\u2013MS. The range of the relative standard deviations is 5.8\u201311.8% (Table 3 ): enrichmentfactor=VsCsVaqC0 where C s is the concentration of analytes in sediment phase after extraction, V s the volume of sediment phase for injecting to GC, V aq the volume of sample solution and C 0 is the initial concentration of analytes in aqueous sample before extraction.\nThe optimum condition for each factor may be inter-related. The conditions we finally selected may not be the optimum. However, we have checked back and forth the conditions from time to time. For instance, the data shown in Fig. 1 should be run at the beginning of the experiment. We have re-run the experiment using the selected conditions we found at the final stage. In Fig. 2, the selectivity for the less sensitive analytes, 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline, was much better as using chlorobenzene for extraction solvent, it therefore may not absolutely required to check it once again. For Fig. 3, the extraction efficiencies were similar using acetone or acetonitrile. Acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxic and cheaper (Refs. ). Similar situation can be found from the date shown in other figures.\nStream waste water sample was filtered through a filter paper before analysis. The aqueous samples were extracted with DLLME under the selected conditions. The selected conditions were listed as below: (1) disperser solvent, acetone; (2) extraction solvent, chlorobenzene; (3) amount of disperser solvent, 0.5 ml; (4) amount of extraction solvent, 8.75 \u03bcl; (5) pH value of sample solution, 4.6; (6) derivatization and extraction temperature, 30 \u00b0C; (7) derivatization and extraction time, 20 min. No anilines were detected in the stream water samples (Tou Cian stream) neighbor to the dye factory tested. The relative recoveries defined as the peak area ratio between blank stream water and the tested stream water sample, which was free of the analytes, spiked at the same concentration (2.5, 2.5, 5, 5 \u03bcg/l) was found to be 69\u201394% (Table 3). No analytes were detected in the stream waste water sample (Fig. 8 ).\nThis work indicates that a selective trace enrichment of carcinogenic anilines from river water samples can be achieved by a DLLME method. The newly developed microextraction technique has distinct advantages over conventional methods with respect to extraction time and volume of solvents required, and low detection limits are readily achieved. This proposed sample preparation procedure is much simpler than the conventional LLE, SPE, and SPME.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Aromatic amines, such as aniline and its substituted derivatives, are generally dangerous because of their toxicity and carcinogenicity or else they can be converted into toxic N-nitroso compounds through reactions with nitrosylating agents in the environment . These contaminants may be released as chemical residues of dyestuffs, cosmetics, medicines and rubber manufacture and also as by-products of energy technologies such as coal-conversion waste processing . Chlorinated anilines such as p-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline were also found as degradation products and intermediates of various phenylurea and phenylcarbamate pesticides . In view of the importance of these compounds, a rapid and sensitive method of analysis is needed to detect them in the environment.\nSeveral methods have been developed for the determination of anilines in environmental samples. Gas chromatography (GC) is a classical method , and presently GC\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) is often used . For non-volatile aniline compounds high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may be used with fluorescence detection after derivatization , or with amperometric detection . Some sample preparation techniques have been reported for the pretreatment of anilines in aqueous samples based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) . In the past years, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has emerged as a versatile solvent-free alternative to SPE procedures. In recent years, a novel technique termed liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) has been developed. However a fast simple preconcentration and microextraction method, DLLME has been presented in 2006 for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and chlorobenzenes (CBs) in water samples and for the first time, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization combined with gas chromatography-electroncapture detection (GC-ECD) were studied for the analysis of 19 chlorophenols (CPs) in water samples . In this method, the appropriate mixture of extraction solvent and disperser solvent are injected into the aqueous sample (5 ml) by syringe, rapidly. Therefore, cloudy solution is formed. In fact, it is consisted of fine particles of extraction solvent which is dispersed entirely into aqueous phase. After centrifuging, the fine particles of extraction solvent are sedimented in the bottom of the conical test tube. The advantages of DLLME method are simplicity of operation, rapidity, low-cost, high-recovery, and enrichment factor.\nIn the present work, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization have been carried out in one-step for the analysis of anilines in water samples at the sub-ppb level and various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were also investigated in this study.\nAll chemicals used in this study were reagent grade, aniline and 4-chloroaniline were obtained (purity > 99%) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline were purchased (purity \u2267 98%) from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Portugal). Derivatization reagent pentafluorobenzaldehyde (PFBAY) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA), chlorobenzene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachloroethylene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachlorocarbon (Showa Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), acetone (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan), acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), and methanol (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan) were also used for this study.\nThe stock solutions were prepared by adding approximately 3 mg of analytes into vials and diluted to 10 ml with methanol. The stock solutions were kept storage at 4 \u00b0C. Before extraction, stock solutions were diluted with blank stream water to aqueous standard of 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) for the optimization experiments. A waste water from Tou Cian stream (Hsinchu, Taiwan) served as the environmental sample.\nAnalysis was carried-out using a gas chromatograph Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 6850 with split/splitless injector operated at 250 \u00b0C in pulse splitless mode (1 min), mass detector Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 5978B. A 30 m HP-5MS (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness) was used for separation. The column oven was initially held at 70 \u00b0C, raised to 295 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, held at 295 \u00b0C for 1 min. The carrier gas was helium (purity 99.9995%); it was further purified by passage through a superior helium gas purifier Agilent (Wilmington, DE, USA) model RMSH-2. A Sorvall 5C Plus Centrifuge (Global Medical, Ramsey, MN, USA) was used.\nAll of the 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tubes (extraction vessel) were manufactured by Ching Fa glass factory (Hsingchu, Taiwan).\nDeionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q (Millipore, MA, USA) purification system.\nIn the simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, an aliquot of 5 ml of a blank stream solution containing 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) was placed in a 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tube. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of acetone (disperser solvent) containing 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene (extraction solvent) and 10 \u03bcl methanol containing PFBAY (30 g/l, derivatization reagent) was injected rapidly into the aqueous solution with a 1 ml syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and a 10 \u03bcl syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA), then the mentioned mixture was kept in a water bath (30 \u00b0C). Dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution. In this step, anilines and PFBAY were extracted into the fine droplet of chlorobenzene rapidly and derivatized in the chlorobenzene, in 20 min. After centrifugation for 2 min at 6000 rpm, fine droplets of extraction solvent were sedimented at the bottom of the conical test tube. The volume of the sedimented phase was determined to approximately 2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl. The sedimented phase (2 \u03bcl) was injected into GC for separation and analysis.\nFor evaluating the pretreatment procedure, the sensitivities of two experiments were compared. In the first experiment, derivatization reagent was added to aqueous sample containing anilines to proceed derivative reaction for 20 min, then 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was injected into above aqueous sample and then the centrifugation was proceeded in 2 min. In the second experiment, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene and derivatization reagent were injected into aqueous sample spiked with anilines, and then centrifugation was proceeded after 20 min. As shown in Fig. 1 , better sensitivity was obtained, except for 3,5-dichloroaniline with similar sensitivity, with simultaneous DLLME and derivatization. It was inferred that difference of sensitivity of anilines between experiment 1 and 2 should be affected by the solubility of anilines in water (Table 1 ) . Therefore simultaneous derivatization and extraction was decided to be the pretreatment procedure.\nIn DLLME method, some characteristics of extraction solvent such as low solubility in water, extraction capability of interested compounds, good chromatographic behavior and higher density than water must be achieved. Thus there are extra limitations on the selection of extraction solvent in DLLME method. Most of the halogenated solvents own above properties.\nTo obtain the better extraction efficiency, chlorobenzene, tetrachloroethylene, and tetrachlorocarbon were tested as extraction solvents. A 5 ml of aqueous sample containing the target compounds were extracted using the procedure described above.\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , the extraction efficiency of aniline and 4-chloroaniline extracted with tetrachlorocarbon were higher than other solvents but from the view of average sensitivity for these four analytes, chlorobenzene was selected as the extraction solvent.\nDisperser solvent should be miscible in water; also it should dissolve the extraction solvent. Thus acetone and acetonitrile were selected as disperser solvents to investigate the effect of these solvents on the performance of DLLME.\nWhen acetone and acetonitrile were tested as disperser solvents containing chlorobenzene to inject into aqueous sample, as shown in the following result (Fig. 3 ), extraction efficiency of acetone was similar to acetonitrile but acetone was less toxic, referred with LC50, than acetonitrile . Consequently, the acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxicity and cheaper.\nFor investigating the effect of volume of disperser solvent on extraction efficiency, various volumes of acetone (0.5, 1, 1.5 ml) containing (10, 13, 16.5 \u03bcl) chlorobenzene were performed, respectively. Increasing the volume of chlorobenzene by increasing the volume of acetone is required to obtain the constant volume of the sedimented phase (3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl). As shown in Fig. 4 , the optimized sensitivity was achieved when 0.5 ml acetone and 10 \u03bcl of chlorobenzene were used.\nIncreasing extraction solvent would increase extracted amount of analytes, however the concentration of analytes in the sedimented phase were also diluted. For enhancing sensitivity, 2 \u03bcl of sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS. Over 2 \u03bcl of injection would cause peak broaden. Here 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent was used to study for obtaining the effect of 2 and 3 \u03bcl of sedimented phase on extraction efficiency. There is no considerable change on the extraction efficiency of these anilines between 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent. Consequently, 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was selected.\nIn this work, the matrices in the river water would influence derivatization and extraction efficiency. Here, different pH values (4, 4.6, 5, 7.8) in sample solution were adjusted to investigate the derivatization and extraction efficiency. The lower sensitivity of stream water (pH 7.8) was observed. Higher sensitivity was acquired as lowering pH value, however sensitivity descended below pH 4.6. As shown in Fig. 5 , the better derivatization and extraction efficiency would be obtained at pH 4.6.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, raising temperature would cause different derivatization performance and solubility of analytes in aqueous. Here, various extraction and derivatization temperatures were investigated to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6 , the sensitivity decreased by increasing extraction and derivatization temperature from 30 to 60 \u00b0C. Thus 30 \u00b0C was used for further study.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution and the surface area between extraction solvent and aqueous phase (water sample) is very large. Transition of anilines and PFBAY from aqueous phase (water sample) to extraction solvent is fast enough to let a quick achieve of the equilibrium state. Thereby, most of the required time was for derivatization of anilines with PFBAY.\nVarious experiments were performed in the range of 0\u201350 min to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7 , there is no considerable change on the sensitivity of these anilines after 20 min and 20 min was selected for extraction and derivatization time.\nThe characteristics of analytes were listed in Table 2 . Enrichment factors, which were defined as formula 1, achieved by the DLLME procedure were 212\u2013645-fold. The linearity of the DLLME for blank water samples of anilines detected by GC\u2013MS was investigated with spiked concentrations of analytes ranging from 0.25 to 70 \u03bcg/l; and method detection limits (MDLs), which were calculated as three times the standard deviation of five replicated runs of spiked samples at lowest concentration of calibration curve, were in the range 0.04\u20130.09 \u03bcg/l. Correlation coefficients, (R 2) values, were between 0.9955 and 0.9985. Linear equation was used to calculate R 2 for GC\u2013MS. The range of the relative standard deviations is 5.8\u201311.8% (Table 3 ): enrichmentfactor=VsCsVaqC0 where C s is the concentration of analytes in sediment phase after extraction, V s the volume of sediment phase for injecting to GC, V aq the volume of sample solution and C 0 is the initial concentration of analytes in aqueous sample before extraction.\nThe optimum condition for each factor may be inter-related. The conditions we finally selected may not be the optimum. However, we have checked back and forth the conditions from time to time. For instance, the data shown in Fig. 1 should be run at the beginning of the experiment. We have re-run the experiment using the selected conditions we found at the final stage. In Fig. 2, the selectivity for the less sensitive analytes, 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline, was much better as using chlorobenzene for extraction solvent, it therefore may not absolutely required to check it once again. For Fig. 3, the extraction efficiencies were similar using acetone or acetonitrile. Acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxic and cheaper (Refs. ). Similar situation can be found from the date shown in other figures.\nStream waste water sample was filtered through a filter paper before analysis. The aqueous samples were extracted with DLLME under the selected conditions. The selected conditions were listed as below: (1) disperser solvent, acetone; (2) extraction solvent, chlorobenzene; (3) amount of disperser solvent, 0.5 ml; (4) amount of extraction solvent, 8.75 \u03bcl; (5) pH value of sample solution, 4.6; (6) derivatization and extraction temperature, 30 \u00b0C; (7) derivatization and extraction time, 20 min. No anilines were detected in the stream water samples (Tou Cian stream) neighbor to the dye factory tested. The relative recoveries defined as the peak area ratio between blank stream water and the tested stream water sample, which was free of the analytes, spiked at the same concentration (2.5, 2.5, 5, 5 \u03bcg/l) was found to be 69\u201394% (Table 3). No analytes were detected in the stream waste water sample (Fig. 8 ).\nThis work indicates that a selective trace enrichment of carcinogenic anilines from river water samples can be achieved by a DLLME method. The newly developed microextraction technique has distinct advantages over conventional methods with respect to extraction time and volume of solvents required, and low detection limits are readily achieved. This proposed sample preparation procedure is much simpler than the conventional LLE, SPE, and SPME."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nOpencast mining causes serious environmental impact like the destruction of natural soils and the extraction of important volumes of materials. This causes the formation of new soils, on the accumulated wastes of the mine known as Anthropic Regosols.\nMinesoils are very young soils developed on unstable materials and characterized by instability and scarce cohesion; these properties easily expose the minesoils to water and air erosion. Minesoils have low contents of nutrients and organic matter. Their texture and structure are unfavourable. Elevated levels of trace elements and the acidic drainage due to the oxidation of sulphide are also frequently common characteristics of the most mine tailings . Therefore, there are severe limitations for the implantation of vegetation in minesoils . The scarce vegetation leads to acidification of adjacent soils by leaching the mine spoils , giving rise to high environmental contamination.\nThe extraction of metal ores causes generally a multielemental contamination of the environment . In addition, the natural metal content of the soils will be increased if materials with heavy metals are added.\nAdding organic material has been used as a means for ameliorating minesoils and improving their quality. These supplements can increase the contamination because they contain heavy metals .\nThe recovery of an ecosystem and mine soil quality depends on vegetation for improving the soil\u2019s biological, chemical, and physical conditions of disturbed sites.\nThe recovery the mine spoils, with potentially toxic metal levels, is very difficult because the trace elements are frequently present in high concentrations and impede the revegetation. The heavy metals diminish the absorption of water and nutrients by plants and the breathing of the root, and they inhibit mitosis in the meristematic root regions .\nMetal absorption by the plants can be affected by several factors such as the soil heavy metal content, the varieties and the age of the plants and by properties like pH, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the organic matter content .\nThe supplements added to minesoils can increase their natural heavy metal content. In addition, the heavy metals in mine spoils with a hyperacidic and hyperoxidaizing environment can be mobilized through drainage and run-off waters. This implies contamination risk of the adjacent zones and underground waters. The soil heavy metal content can impede the mine spoil\u2019s revegetation if the available contents are toxic for the vegetation. For that reason it is necessary to know not only the total content, but also the available and dissolved contents.\nIt is also necessary to know the minesoil\u2019s characteristics, such as clay minerals, oxides and organic matter contents, the cation exchange capacity and pH because the soil properties affect the available total heavy metal content. The soil properties can determine the degree of toxicity the vegetal growth.\nThe CEC of the clay minerals varies with the crystal lattice structure and with the degree of isomorphic substitution so it is necessary to identify the minesoil clay minerals, their diversity and their abundance. The different clay minerals will contribute in different ways to the minesoil\u2019s heavy metal retention capacity . Soil clay minerals will affect the minesoil\u2019s capacity to retain their own heavy metals and the trace elements that were added through the supplements.\nThe objectives of this work were to characterize soils coming from the tailings of two opencast mines (in Galicia, Spain) and to determine the total content and the availability of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Knowledge of this content will serve to select the supplements to use in the revegetation, avoiding an increase of the heavy metal content and availability.\nThe superficial horizons of twenty-five soils were sampled (Anthropic Regosols) . They are located in Coru\u00f1a province (Galicia) (Fig. 1 ) and developed on mine tailings. Ten come from the depleted copper mine of Touro and fifteen from the lignite mine of Meirama.\nTwo zones were selected in the depleted copper mine, now dedicated to the extraction of material for road construction. The tailings are formed fundamentally by oxidized materials, with amphibolites, chalcopyrite, limonite, garnet, and mainly iron and copper sulphides. The minesoils of these spoils (TE) are in an initial period of recovery, brought about by means of the plantation of eucalyptus and the application of fertilizers and diverse types of sewage sludge. The decantation-bank (TB), where the sludge from the copper extraction in the flotation plant was deposited, and was covered with ash coming from a paper mill. The soils of these tailings practically lack vegetation.\nMeirama minesoils have been formed on the waste materials of the lignite mine. Three zones had been selected in these mine spoils. One, in a wetland that was made in a mine spoil (MH). The second is situated in the tailings formed approximately in the year 2000. Their revegetation began that same year. The soils are thin with strong limitations for plant growth (MI). The last selected zone is the mine spoil, 10 years old, with more developed soils (ME) with vegetation of herbaceous plants, legumes and trees (alders and pines).\nFive soils (Anthropic Regosols) have been selected in each zone (Fig. 1). Sampling was carried out from topsoils (0\u201330 cm). The samples were collected using an Eijkelkamp sampler. Five samples of each site sample were taken and stored in polyethylene bags. The samples were air dried, passed through a 2 mm sieve and homogenized in a vibratory homogeniser for solid samples (Fritsch Laborette 27 rotary sampler divider) and five sub samples from the composed sample were taken for the analyses.\nThe samples were analysed for particle size distribution, pH, nitrogen, organic carbon, effective cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, and iron, aluminium and manganese contents.\nA mineralogical analysis of the fraction <2 \u03bcm has also been performed.\nSoil reaction was determined with a pH electrode in 2:1 water to soil extracts . The particle size distribution was conducted after the oxidation of organic matter with hydrogen peroxide, separating the upper fraction to 50 mm by means of sieves, and the lower fraction using the international procedure . The Organic carbon content was determined by the Walkey and Black method . Organic matter was fractionated using the humid sieving procedure proposed by Andriulo et al. and Galantini et al. , which facilitates obtaining humified organic matter and non-humified organic matter contents.\nTotal Kjeldahl-N was determined according to Bruemmer and Mulvaney . Soil CEC and exchangeable cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) were extracted with 1 M ammonium acetate solution, buffered to pH 7.0, and concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission (ICP-AES) spectrometry. Exchangeable acidity was determined using a 1 M KCl replacing solution and titration to a phenolphthalein endpoint .\nAl, Ca, K, Mg and Na were extracted by BaCl2 solution and concentrations determined by ICP-AES (Perkin-Elmer Optima 4300 DV).\nThe Mehra and Jackson method was used to determine the oxides content, shaking the samples with a solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium citrate. Fe, Al and Mn were determined in the extract by ICP-AES.\nMineralogical analysis of the clay fraction was made by X-ray diffraction, of crystalline powder in a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer. To measure the samples, q-2q a configuration was used (Bragg\u2013Brentano system) with a Cu anode and 0.05 passes with a time of 10 s per pass . Total dissolved Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were extracted using acidified calcium chloride solution (0.1 M), according to the method developed by Houba et al. . The available Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn content was extracted using the diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA) method developed by Lindsay and Norwell . Total contents were extracted by means of acid digestion using a mixture of concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids (1:3:3 v/v) in PTFE bom placed in a microwave oven . The analysis for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn was carried out by ICP-AES.\nAll the experiments were performed in triplicate. The data obtained in the analytical determinations were treated statistically using the programme SPSS version 10.1 for Windows . Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and test of least significant difference (L.S.D.) were made. The evaluation of the influence of the soil characteristics on the metal adsorption capacity was examined by correlation analysis.\nThe characteristics of the soils (Table 1 ) show that there are important and significant differences, mainly between those that can affect heavy metal adsorption, mobility and, consequently, retention by the soil.\nMinesoil pH ranges from levels close to neutrality (6.11, the wetland Meirama soils, MH) to strong acidity (3.62, Touro minesoils, TE) (Table 1). These differences can influence heavy metal adsorption capacity since these trace elements are very mobile in acidic conditions and their mobility and availability decreases as the pH approaches neutrality .\nOrganic matter contents are low in all the soils and range from 15.04 g kg\u22121 (TB soils) to 0.80 g kg\u22121 (ME soils) (Table 1). The organic matter is a component of great importance because it tends to form soluble or insoluble complexes with the heavy metals, the reason why they can migrate throughout the profile or be retained in the soil.\nThe fractionation of the organic matter indicates the adsorption capacity of this component in diverse soils due to the different adsorption capacities, of the humified (stable) and non-humified (fresh) organic matter. The results show that the humified organic matter content, with greater capacity of complexation and retention, is very low in MH soils (0.52 g kg\u22121) and a the high content appears in TB soils (13.83 g kg\u22121) (Table 1). In all the soils, the humified organic matter content is at least 75% of the total organic matter content.\nThe CEC was low for all soils and ranged from 6 cmol kg\u22121 (TB and MI soils) to 9.47 cmol kg\u22121 (TE soils) (Table 1).\nSeveral authors have demonstrated that oxides, mainly Fe and Mn oxides, have a high capacity to adsorb heavy metals in the soil mineral\u2013water interphase. The studied minesoils have different Mn, Fe and Al oxide contents. TB soils display the greatest content of these oxides: Al2O3 (21.1 g k\u22121), Fe2O3 (3.62 g k\u22121), and MnO (1.20 g k\u22121) (Table 1).\nThe particle size distribution shows (Table 1) that the soils from TE contain the lowest clay content. TE soils are very young, the tailings in which they were formed are the most recent and, therefore, the time that has been available for the mine spoils alteration is short. These soils lack vegetation almost totally, which exposes the very fine particles to hydrolytic erosion and being removed by run-off water.\nThe soils from ME spoils contain the greatest clay content. The ME area contains the oldest and most developed soils with vegetation already installed. The soils from TB, MH and MI spoils present very similar clay contents, which can be explained by the similar age of the mine spoil that allowed at least partial modification of the parent matter. The erosion risk is high because the installed vegetation is very scarce.\nThe different clay minerals properties, like the CEC, specific surface and charge density , influence decisively the adsorption capacity. For that reason a semi-quantitative mineralogical analysis of the soils clay fraction was made (Figs. 2 and 3 , Table 2 ).\nThe results show that kaolinite is the most abundant mineral in all the studied soils, mainly in the MH zone; 95% of the total clay content of the MH soils is kaolinite which only contains, in addition, a small content of smectite and mica. In the other soils, the proportion of kaolinite ranges between 40.8% in TB soils to 90.6% in ME soils. The soils from the Touro mine spoils contain a smaller kaolinite content (Table 2).\nMH, MI and ME soils, coming from Meirama mine spoils, contain smectite, with a great CEC and greater capacity of heavy metal adsorption . The soils from the copper mine spoils do not contain smectite (Table 2).\nThe soils from TE, TB and MI contain gibbsite, but MH and ME soils lack this mineral; the greater content appears in Touro minesoils (Table 2). These soils also have high goethite content. The TE soils have significant chlorite and talc (4.2%) contents (Table 2).\nThe mineralogical analysis (Fig. 2) indicated a remarkable non-crystalline mineral presence in TE and TB soils; this amorphous material has great affinity to adsorb different heavy metals, according to various authors .\nFigs. 4\u20136 show the total dissolved, the DTPA-extractable and the total contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn (mg kg\u22121) in the studied soils. Dissolved Cd has not been found in any soil. The total dissolved contents of the other heavy metals are low (<2 mg kg\u22121) except for the dissolved Cu content in TE soils (12.97 mg kg\u22121) (Fig. 4).\nDTPA-extractable heavy metals are relatively low (<5 mg kg\u22121), except DTPA-extractable Cu in the soils from Touro mine spoils (TE: 26.33 mg kg\u22121 and TB: 67.7 mg kg\u22121, Fig. 5).\nThe total heavy metal soils content is slightly high, although only the Cu total content (1217 mg kg\u22121) in TB soils exceeds the intervention limit of diverse reference guides . The Cr total content (151 mg kg\u22121) in TB soils and total Zn content (111 mg kg\u22121) in TE soils (Fig. 6) are high; the toxicity risk will depend on the soil characteristics, on each metal, on environmental conditions and on soil handling, according to Dudka and Domy . All can increase Cr and Zn mobilization.\nTable 3 shows the proportion of each element extractable with DTPA, which gives information about the heavy metal availability. For most metals, this is 10% of the total content.\nThe proportion of DTPA-extractable Cd is 11.48% in MH soils (Table 3) although the total content is low (<5 mg kg\u22121) (Fig. 6). DTPA-extractable Cd has not been found in Touro minesoils, whereas in the Meirama minesoils (MI and ME) it does not reach 3% of the total content (Table 3).\nThe relation established between the soils clay content and the DTPA-extractable Cd (Table 4 ) shows that the clay is one of the most strongly involved soil components in Cd availability, therefore, the greater the amount of clay, the greater the amount of available Cd, which agrees with the results of other authors .\nIn all the studied soils, proportion of the DTPA-extractable Cr is very low (Fig. 5, Table 3), which indicates that most of Cr is strongly bound in soil primary minerals.\nThe proportion of DTPA-extractable Cu is 5% in all soils (Table 3). The TB soils display the smallest proportion (5.6%) and MI the highest one (16.1%), whereas the DTPA-extractable Cu is 15% in TE and MI soils. Although in TB soils the proportion of DTPA-extractable Cu is low, the total content of Cu is very high (Fig. 6), therefore the available content is also high.\nThe relation established (Table 4) between the soil organic matter content, and the humified organic matter, with the total, DTPA-extractable and soil dissolved Cu content, shows that the humified organic matter is the fraction involved in the formation of soluble complexes and in the electrostatic adsorption of Cu. This demonstrates the capacity of the organic matter to establish not only soluble complexes but also insoluble compounds with Cu, which has been found by other authors . A positive correlation has also been established between the DTPA-extractable Cu and the Fe and Mn oxides content, which probably indicates that the Cu2+ can be, partly, adsorbed by oxides.\nThe positive correlation (Table 4) established between the DTPA-extractable Cu content with the gibbsite, goethite and chlorite contents demonstrates that these minerals, have a high capacity to adsorb Cu, which agrees with the results obtained by Schwertmann and Taylor .\nThe proportion of DTPA-extractable Ni in MI soils is 7.5% (Table 3). In the other studied soils this proportion is 2%, which indicates that Ni is probably strongly bound in the soil primary minerals. A positive correlation has been established (Table 4) between iron oxides, micas and talc contents with the DTPA-extractable Ni, which indicates the electrostatic combination of the Ni2+ and these soil components. Several authors found that Ni is mainly adsorbed by soil iron oxides.\nIn MI soils the proportion of DTPA-extractable Pb is 13.1%, whereas in TE soils it is 5.2% and in TB, MH and ME soils it is close the 2% (Table 3). A positive correlation has been established (Table 4) between the smectite content and the DTPA-extractable Pb content .\nIn spite of the high total content of Zn (Fig. 6), mainly in copper minesoils, the proportion of DTPA-extractable Zn in TE and TB soils does not reach 2% and in lignite minesoils, nearly 4% of the total Zn content is DTPA-extractable (Table 3). The low proportion of DTPA-extractable Zn indicates that most of the Zn remains in the non-altered parent matter strongly bound in soil primary minerals.\nThe origin of the Zn, Ni, and Cr contents of minesoils has been confirmed by means of the established positive correlation between the total content of these metals (Table 4). This correlation indicates that these metals come from the minerals of the parent matter of copper minesoils (chalcopyrite, amphibolites and limonite). Nevertheless, the Zn, Ni and Cr origin in lignite minesoils is the parent matter, fertilizers, like superphosphate , and animal manure that have been added to the soils for several years. In lignite minesoils the contents of DTPA-extractable Zn, Ni and Cr are greater than in copper minesoils (Fig. 5, Table 3) because the metals are weakly bound in the added supplements than in the soil minerals.\nThe total Cu content of TB soils (Fig. 6) is the only one that surpasses the intervention limit indicated in various reference guides and these TB soils contains the smallest proportion of DTPA-extractable metals content (\u2211Mn+=9.8%) (Table 3). They have, in addition, the highest content of the soil components that have the greatest heavy metals adsorption capacity (Table 1). For this reason they can neutralize, at least in the short term, the toxic effects possible from the liberation of their heavy metal content (Figs. 4\u20136).\nThe soils that contain the higher proportion of DTPA-extractable metal species (TE, MH and ME soils: \u224825% and MI soils: 43.3%) (Table 3), will tend to mobilize these metals. In these soils, the high available heavy metal content will make revegetation difficult and consequently the stabilization of tailings can be very complex and slow due to heavy metals toxicity.\nThe total heavy metal dissolved contents are low (<2 mg kg\u22121) in all the studied soils except the content of dissolved Cu in soils from copper mine tailings (13.0 mg kg\u22121).\nSoil DTPA-extractable heavy metals concentrations are low (<5 mg kg\u22121), except for DTPA-extractable Cu in the soils from Touro mine spoils (TE: 26.3 mg kg\u22121 and TB: 67.7 mg kg\u22121).\nThe total heavy metal content of the soils is slightly high. In TB soils the total Cu content (1217 mg kg\u22121) exceeds the intervention limit of various reference guides.\nIn Touro minesoils, the Cr, Ni and Zn total contents come from the parent matter of these soils. The correlation established between the total contents of these metals suggests its common origin through the soils parent matter.\nIn Meirama minesoils, the fertilizers, and animal manure which were added for several years, and the parent matter contribution, produce the heavy metal content.\nThe toxic effects that heavy metals content could cause can be minimized, at least in the short term, in the minesoils with the higher concentrations of iron and manganese oxides, humified organic matter, and clay minerals, especially chlorite, gibbsite and goethite. The unfavourable properties of the soils will improve, the natural heavy metal contents in available forms will diminish and the stabilization of the tailings will be possible if the organic matter and clay contents were increased.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

The natural metal content of the soils will also increase if materials with heavy metals are added.\n\nQ4: How does the addition of organic material affect minesoils?\nA4: Adding organic material has been used as a means for ameliorating minesoils and improving their quality. However, this can also increase contamination as the organic matter can contain heavy metals.\n\nQ5: What is the role of vegetation in the recovery of an ecosystem and mine soil quality?\nA5: The recovery of an ecosystem and mine soil quality depends on vegetation for improving the soil\u2019s biological, chemical, and physical conditions of disturbed sites.\n\nQ6: What is the effect of heavy metals on plant absorption?\nA6: Heavy metals can diminish the absorption of water and nutrients by plants and inhibit mitosis in the meristematic root regions. They also decrease the available heavy metal content, making revegetation difficult.\n\nQ7: How does the clay mineral content affect heavy metal retention in soils?\nA7: The clay minerals vary in their cation exchange capacity (CEC) and this can influence heavy metal retention. Soil clay minerals will affect the mine spoil\u2019s capacity to retain their own heavy metals and the trace elements that were added through the supplements.\n\nQ8: What was the objective of the work done on the opencast mines in Galicia, Spain?\nA8: The objective was to characterize soils coming from the tailings of two opencast mines in Galicia, Spain and determine the total content and the availability of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. This information will help in selecting the supplements to use in the revegetation, avoiding an increase of the heavy metal content and availability.\n\nQ9: What are the differences in heavy metal adsorption capacity between the soils?\nA9: The heavy metal adsorption capacity varies significantly, mainly among soils that can affect heavy metal mobility and retention by the soil. For instance, pH levels, organic matter content, and the presence of certain oxides can influence heavy metal adsorption.\n\nQ10: How does the DTPA-extractable heavy metal content indicate heavy metal availability?\nA10: The proportion of DTPA-extractable heavy metals indicates the availability of these metals in the soil. A higher proportion indicates that the metal is more available and can be more easily mobilized. For instance, the DTPA-extractable Cu content in Touro mine spoils was low, indicating that the available Cu content was also low.",

        "txt": "Opencast mining causes serious environmental impact like the destruction of natural soils and the extraction of important volumes of materials. This causes the formation of new soils, on the accumulated wastes of the mine known as Anthropic Regosols.\nMinesoils are very young soils developed on unstable materials and characterized by instability and scarce cohesion; these properties easily expose the minesoils to water and air erosion. Minesoils have low contents of nutrients and organic matter. Their texture and structure are unfavourable. Elevated levels of trace elements and the acidic drainage due to the oxidation of sulphide are also frequently common characteristics of the most mine tailings . Therefore, there are severe limitations for the implantation of vegetation in minesoils . The scarce vegetation leads to acidification of adjacent soils by leaching the mine spoils , giving rise to high environmental contamination.\nThe extraction of metal ores causes generally a multielemental contamination of the environment . In addition, the natural metal content of the soils will be increased if materials with heavy metals are added.\nAdding organic material has been used as a means for ameliorating minesoils and improving their quality. These supplements can increase the contamination because they contain heavy metals .\nThe recovery of an ecosystem and mine soil quality depends on vegetation for improving the soil\u2019s biological, chemical, and physical conditions of disturbed sites.\nThe recovery the mine spoils, with potentially toxic metal levels, is very difficult because the trace elements are frequently present in high concentrations and impede the revegetation. The heavy metals diminish the absorption of water and nutrients by plants and the breathing of the root, and they inhibit mitosis in the meristematic root regions .\nMetal absorption by the plants can be affected by several factors such as the soil heavy metal content, the varieties and the age of the plants and by properties like pH, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the organic matter content .\nThe supplements added to minesoils can increase their natural heavy metal content. In addition, the heavy metals in mine spoils with a hyperacidic and hyperoxidaizing environment can be mobilized through drainage and run-off waters. This implies contamination risk of the adjacent zones and underground waters. The soil heavy metal content can impede the mine spoil\u2019s revegetation if the available contents are toxic for the vegetation. For that reason it is necessary to know not only the total content, but also the available and dissolved contents.\nIt is also necessary to know the minesoil\u2019s characteristics, such as clay minerals, oxides and organic matter contents, the cation exchange capacity and pH because the soil properties affect the available total heavy metal content. The soil properties can determine the degree of toxicity the vegetal growth.\nThe CEC of the clay minerals varies with the crystal lattice structure and with the degree of isomorphic substitution so it is necessary to identify the minesoil clay minerals, their diversity and their abundance. The different clay minerals will contribute in different ways to the minesoil\u2019s heavy metal retention capacity . Soil clay minerals will affect the minesoil\u2019s capacity to retain their own heavy metals and the trace elements that were added through the supplements.\nThe objectives of this work were to characterize soils coming from the tailings of two opencast mines (in Galicia, Spain) and to determine the total content and the availability of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Knowledge of this content will serve to select the supplements to use in the revegetation, avoiding an increase of the heavy metal content and availability.\nThe superficial horizons of twenty-five soils were sampled (Anthropic Regosols) . They are located in Coru\u00f1a province (Galicia) (Fig. 1 ) and developed on mine tailings. Ten come from the depleted copper mine of Touro and fifteen from the lignite mine of Meirama.\nTwo zones were selected in the depleted copper mine, now dedicated to the extraction of material for road construction. The tailings are formed fundamentally by oxidized materials, with amphibolites, chalcopyrite, limonite, garnet, and mainly iron and copper sulphides. The minesoils of these spoils (TE) are in an initial period of recovery, brought about by means of the plantation of eucalyptus and the application of fertilizers and diverse types of sewage sludge. The decantation-bank (TB), where the sludge from the copper extraction in the flotation plant was deposited, and was covered with ash coming from a paper mill. The soils of these tailings practically lack vegetation.\nMeirama minesoils have been formed on the waste materials of the lignite mine. Three zones had been selected in these mine spoils. One, in a wetland that was made in a mine spoil (MH). The second is situated in the tailings formed approximately in the year 2000. Their revegetation began that same year. The soils are thin with strong limitations for plant growth (MI). The last selected zone is the mine spoil, 10 years old, with more developed soils (ME) with vegetation of herbaceous plants, legumes and trees (alders and pines).\nFive soils (Anthropic Regosols) have been selected in each zone (Fig. 1). Sampling was carried out from topsoils (0\u201330 cm). The samples were collected using an Eijkelkamp sampler. Five samples of each site sample were taken and stored in polyethylene bags. The samples were air dried, passed through a 2 mm sieve and homogenized in a vibratory homogeniser for solid samples (Fritsch Laborette 27 rotary sampler divider) and five sub samples from the composed sample were taken for the analyses.\nThe samples were analysed for particle size distribution, pH, nitrogen, organic carbon, effective cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, and iron, aluminium and manganese contents.\nA mineralogical analysis of the fraction <2 \u03bcm has also been performed.\nSoil reaction was determined with a pH electrode in 2:1 water to soil extracts . The particle size distribution was conducted after the oxidation of organic matter with hydrogen peroxide, separating the upper fraction to 50 mm by means of sieves, and the lower fraction using the international procedure . The Organic carbon content was determined by the Walkey and Black method . Organic matter was fractionated using the humid sieving procedure proposed by Andriulo et al. and Galantini et al. , which facilitates obtaining humified organic matter and non-humified organic matter contents.\nTotal Kjeldahl-N was determined according to Bruemmer and Mulvaney . Soil CEC and exchangeable cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) were extracted with 1 M ammonium acetate solution, buffered to pH 7.0, and concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission (ICP-AES) spectrometry. Exchangeable acidity was determined using a 1 M KCl replacing solution and titration to a phenolphthalein endpoint .\nAl, Ca, K, Mg and Na were extracted by BaCl2 solution and concentrations determined by ICP-AES (Perkin-Elmer Optima 4300 DV).\nThe Mehra and Jackson method was used to determine the oxides content, shaking the samples with a solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium citrate. Fe, Al and Mn were determined in the extract by ICP-AES.\nMineralogical analysis of the clay fraction was made by X-ray diffraction, of crystalline powder in a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer. To measure the samples, q-2q a configuration was used (Bragg\u2013Brentano system) with a Cu anode and 0.05 passes with a time of 10 s per pass . Total dissolved Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were extracted using acidified calcium chloride solution (0.1 M), according to the method developed by Houba et al. . The available Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn content was extracted using the diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA) method developed by Lindsay and Norwell . Total contents were extracted by means of acid digestion using a mixture of concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids (1:3:3 v/v) in PTFE bom placed in a microwave oven . The analysis for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn was carried out by ICP-AES.\nAll the experiments were performed in triplicate. The data obtained in the analytical determinations were treated statistically using the programme SPSS version 10.1 for Windows . Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and test of least significant difference (L.S.D.) were made. The evaluation of the influence of the soil characteristics on the metal adsorption capacity was examined by correlation analysis.\nThe characteristics of the soils (Table 1 ) show that there are important and significant differences, mainly between those that can affect heavy metal adsorption, mobility and, consequently, retention by the soil.\nMinesoil pH ranges from levels close to neutrality (6.11, the wetland Meirama soils, MH) to strong acidity (3.62, Touro minesoils, TE) (Table 1). These differences can influence heavy metal adsorption capacity since these trace elements are very mobile in acidic conditions and their mobility and availability decreases as the pH approaches neutrality .\nOrganic matter contents are low in all the soils and range from 15.04 g kg\u22121 (TB soils) to 0.80 g kg\u22121 (ME soils) (Table 1). The organic matter is a component of great importance because it tends to form soluble or insoluble complexes with the heavy metals, the reason why they can migrate throughout the profile or be retained in the soil.\nThe fractionation of the organic matter indicates the adsorption capacity of this component in diverse soils due to the different adsorption capacities, of the humified (stable) and non-humified (fresh) organic matter. The results show that the humified organic matter content, with greater capacity of complexation and retention, is very low in MH soils (0.52 g kg\u22121) and a the high content appears in TB soils (13.83 g kg\u22121) (Table 1). In all the soils, the humified organic matter content is at least 75% of the total organic matter content.\nThe CEC was low for all soils and ranged from 6 cmol kg\u22121 (TB and MI soils) to 9.47 cmol kg\u22121 (TE soils) (Table 1).\nSeveral authors have demonstrated that oxides, mainly Fe and Mn oxides, have a high capacity to adsorb heavy metals in the soil mineral\u2013water interphase. The studied minesoils have different Mn, Fe and Al oxide contents. TB soils display the greatest content of these oxides: Al2O3 (21.1 g k\u22121), Fe2O3 (3.62 g k\u22121), and MnO (1.20 g k\u22121) (Table 1).\nThe particle size distribution shows (Table 1) that the soils from TE contain the lowest clay content. TE soils are very young, the tailings in which they were formed are the most recent and, therefore, the time that has been available for the mine spoils alteration is short. These soils lack vegetation almost totally, which exposes the very fine particles to hydrolytic erosion and being removed by run-off water.\nThe soils from ME spoils contain the greatest clay content. The ME area contains the oldest and most developed soils with vegetation already installed. The soils from TB, MH and MI spoils present very similar clay contents, which can be explained by the similar age of the mine spoil that allowed at least partial modification of the parent matter. The erosion risk is high because the installed vegetation is very scarce.\nThe different clay minerals properties, like the CEC, specific surface and charge density , influence decisively the adsorption capacity. For that reason a semi-quantitative mineralogical analysis of the soils clay fraction was made (Figs. 2 and 3 , Table 2 ).\nThe results show that kaolinite is the most abundant mineral in all the studied soils, mainly in the MH zone; 95% of the total clay content of the MH soils is kaolinite which only contains, in addition, a small content of smectite and mica. In the other soils, the proportion of kaolinite ranges between 40.8% in TB soils to 90.6% in ME soils. The soils from the Touro mine spoils contain a smaller kaolinite content (Table 2).\nMH, MI and ME soils, coming from Meirama mine spoils, contain smectite, with a great CEC and greater capacity of heavy metal adsorption . The soils from the copper mine spoils do not contain smectite (Table 2).\nThe soils from TE, TB and MI contain gibbsite, but MH and ME soils lack this mineral; the greater content appears in Touro minesoils (Table 2). These soils also have high goethite content. The TE soils have significant chlorite and talc (4.2%) contents (Table 2).\nThe mineralogical analysis (Fig. 2) indicated a remarkable non-crystalline mineral presence in TE and TB soils; this amorphous material has great affinity to adsorb different heavy metals, according to various authors .\nFigs. 4\u20136 show the total dissolved, the DTPA-extractable and the total contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn (mg kg\u22121) in the studied soils. Dissolved Cd has not been found in any soil. The total dissolved contents of the other heavy metals are low (<2 mg kg\u22121) except for the dissolved Cu content in TE soils (12.97 mg kg\u22121) (Fig. 4).\nDTPA-extractable heavy metals are relatively low (<5 mg kg\u22121), except DTPA-extractable Cu in the soils from Touro mine spoils (TE: 26.33 mg kg\u22121 and TB: 67.7 mg kg\u22121, Fig. 5).\nThe total heavy metal soils content is slightly high, although only the Cu total content (1217 mg kg\u22121) in TB soils exceeds the intervention limit of diverse reference guides . The Cr total content (151 mg kg\u22121) in TB soils and total Zn content (111 mg kg\u22121) in TE soils (Fig. 6) are high; the toxicity risk will depend on the soil characteristics, on each metal, on environmental conditions and on soil handling, according to Dudka and Domy . All can increase Cr and Zn mobilization.\nTable 3 shows the proportion of each element extractable with DTPA, which gives information about the heavy metal availability. For most metals, this is 10% of the total content.\nThe proportion of DTPA-extractable Cd is 11.48% in MH soils (Table 3) although the total content is low (<5 mg kg\u22121) (Fig. 6). DTPA-extractable Cd has not been found in Touro minesoils, whereas in the Meirama minesoils (MI and ME) it does not reach 3% of the total content (Table 3).\nThe relation established between the soils clay content and the DTPA-extractable Cd (Table 4 ) shows that the clay is one of the most strongly involved soil components in Cd availability, therefore, the greater the amount of clay, the greater the amount of available Cd, which agrees with the results of other authors .\nIn all the studied soils, proportion of the DTPA-extractable Cr is very low (Fig. 5, Table 3), which indicates that most of Cr is strongly bound in soil primary minerals.\nThe proportion of DTPA-extractable Cu is 5% in all soils (Table 3). The TB soils display the smallest proportion (5.6%) and MI the highest one (16.1%), whereas the DTPA-extractable Cu is 15% in TE and MI soils. Although in TB soils the proportion of DTPA-extractable Cu is low, the total content of Cu is very high (Fig. 6), therefore the available content is also high.\nThe relation established (Table 4) between the soil organic matter content, and the humified organic matter, with the total, DTPA-extractable and soil dissolved Cu content, shows that the humified organic matter is the fraction involved in the formation of soluble complexes and in the electrostatic adsorption of Cu. This demonstrates the capacity of the organic matter to establish not only soluble complexes but also insoluble compounds with Cu, which has been found by other authors . A positive correlation has also been established between the DTPA-extractable Cu and the Fe and Mn oxides content, which probably indicates that the Cu2+ can be, partly, adsorbed by oxides.\nThe positive correlation (Table 4) established between the DTPA-extractable Cu content with the gibbsite, goethite and chlorite contents demonstrates that these minerals, have a high capacity to adsorb Cu, which agrees with the results obtained by Schwertmann and Taylor .\nThe proportion of DTPA-extractable Ni in MI soils is 7.5% (Table 3). In the other studied soils this proportion is 2%, which indicates that Ni is probably strongly bound in the soil primary minerals. A positive correlation has been established (Table 4) between iron oxides, micas and talc contents with the DTPA-extractable Ni, which indicates the electrostatic combination of the Ni2+ and these soil components. Several authors found that Ni is mainly adsorbed by soil iron oxides.\nIn MI soils the proportion of DTPA-extractable Pb is 13.1%, whereas in TE soils it is 5.2% and in TB, MH and ME soils it is close the 2% (Table 3). A positive correlation has been established (Table 4) between the smectite content and the DTPA-extractable Pb content .\nIn spite of the high total content of Zn (Fig. 6), mainly in copper minesoils, the proportion of DTPA-extractable Zn in TE and TB soils does not reach 2% and in lignite minesoils, nearly 4% of the total Zn content is DTPA-extractable (Table 3). The low proportion of DTPA-extractable Zn indicates that most of the Zn remains in the non-altered parent matter strongly bound in soil primary minerals.\nThe origin of the Zn, Ni, and Cr contents of minesoils has been confirmed by means of the established positive correlation between the total content of these metals (Table 4). This correlation indicates that these metals come from the minerals of the parent matter of copper minesoils (chalcopyrite, amphibolites and limonite). Nevertheless, the Zn, Ni and Cr origin in lignite minesoils is the parent matter, fertilizers, like superphosphate , and animal manure that have been added to the soils for several years. In lignite minesoils the contents of DTPA-extractable Zn, Ni and Cr are greater than in copper minesoils (Fig. 5, Table 3) because the metals are weakly bound in the added supplements than in the soil minerals.\nThe total Cu content of TB soils (Fig. 6) is the only one that surpasses the intervention limit indicated in various reference guides and these TB soils contains the smallest proportion of DTPA-extractable metals content (\u2211Mn+=9.8%) (Table 3). They have, in addition, the highest content of the soil components that have the greatest heavy metals adsorption capacity (Table 1). For this reason they can neutralize, at least in the short term, the toxic effects possible from the liberation of their heavy metal content (Figs. 4\u20136).\nThe soils that contain the higher proportion of DTPA-extractable metal species (TE, MH and ME soils: \u224825% and MI soils: 43.3%) (Table 3), will tend to mobilize these metals. In these soils, the high available heavy metal content will make revegetation difficult and consequently the stabilization of tailings can be very complex and slow due to heavy metals toxicity.\nThe total heavy metal dissolved contents are low (<2 mg kg\u22121) in all the studied soils except the content of dissolved Cu in soils from copper mine tailings (13.0 mg kg\u22121).\nSoil DTPA-extractable heavy metals concentrations are low (<5 mg kg\u22121), except for DTPA-extractable Cu in the soils from Touro mine spoils (TE: 26.3 mg kg\u22121 and TB: 67.7 mg kg\u22121).\nThe total heavy metal content of the soils is slightly high. In TB soils the total Cu content (1217 mg kg\u22121) exceeds the intervention limit of various reference guides.\nIn Touro minesoils, the Cr, Ni and Zn total contents come from the parent matter of these soils. The correlation established between the total contents of these metals suggests its common origin through the soils parent matter.\nIn Meirama minesoils, the fertilizers, and animal manure which were added for several years, and the parent matter contribution, produce the heavy metal content.\nThe toxic effects that heavy metals content could cause can be minimized, at least in the short term, in the minesoils with the higher concentrations of iron and manganese oxides, humified organic matter, and clay minerals, especially chlorite, gibbsite and goethite. The unfavourable properties of the soils will improve, the natural heavy metal contents in available forms will diminish and the stabilization of the tailings will be possible if the organic matter and clay contents were increased."

Rapid diagnostic assays have been in use for decades in the clinical and medical sector with, e.g., the pregnancy test strip as one of the first commercially available test strips with widespread use. In the last decade, rapid immunoassay-based tests have also increasingly been used in the food and feed sector, where applications range from the screening for foodborne pathogens, drug residues, antibiotics, and mycotoxins, to allergens and, recently, genetically modified organisms. Amongst these, tests for mycotoxins which allow screening of agricultural commodities with results within 15\u00a0min are gaining acceptance and are being firmly integrated into routine quality-monitoring procedures, because of the need for rapid on-site (pre)-screening [1].Mycotoxins are toxic natural secondary metabolites produced by several species of fungus, for example Aspergillus and Fusarium, on agricultural commodities in the field or during storage. These toxins cause food- and feed-borne intoxication, and many are cytotoxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or immunosuppressive [2]. Due to the health risks for humans and animals, authorities such as the European Commission or the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) have addressed the mycotoxin problem by adopting regulatory limits. Regulations are in force for, e.g., aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and Fusarium toxins in selected foodstuffs (EC 1881/2006) [3], and there are recommendations for maximum levels of mycotoxins in feed (EC 2006/576/EC) [4]. In the United States, action levels or advisory levels are in force for, e.g., aflatoxins and deoxynivalenol, respectively [5].Besides validated official analytical methods for mycotoxin detection based on chromatographic principles [6, 7], rapid screening tests and a number of new techniques such as biosensors are rapidly emerging [8\u201310]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have become a standard tool for rapid monitoring of mycotoxins. Despite a high matrix dependence, microtiter plate ELISAs offer the advantages of speed, ease of operation, sensitivity, and high sample throughput. Nevertheless, faster and more straightforward immunoassay-based tests are preferentially used for applications where on-site use is necessary, because they allow rapid turnover. Fluorescence polarization immunoassays have been developed for mycotoxins such as DON, ZON, and aflatoxins [11] and are commercially available. These instrument-based assays are enzyme-free and homogeneous and make use of a mycotoxin-fluorophore conjugate such as a fluorescein tracer. Such rapid methods for analysis of mycotoxins have been reviewed elsewhere [12]. Rapid disposable membrane-based assay tests have been developed in multiple formats, for example test strips [13], flow-through tests [14], and dip sticks [15, 16]. Dip sticks work like an ELISA, with carrier membranes instead of microtiter plates. But similar to ELISA, the performance of one to four working steps such as washing, blocking, sample incubation, and staining requires a total time of 30\u00a0min to 3\u00a0h to obtain the test results, which cannot compete with a 5\u201310\u00a0min test strip. Flow-through membrane-based immunoassays are comparable with lateral-flow test strips in rapidity and ease of use. But these are qualitative or semi-quantitative tests and interpretation of results may be difficult when the test result is close to the cutoff level [12]. Although dip sticks and flow-through immunoassays have been developed for mycotoxins, they are not as commercially successful as test strips. This review will therefore focus on membrane-based test strips, also called lateral-flow devices (LFDs).Lateral-flow devicesLFDs are based on a test format which includes sample flow along an analytical nitrocellulose membrane due to capillary forces and enables fast and easy-to-handle immunoassays which can be both qualitative with a defined cutoff level or quantitative when used with a photometric strip reader. The development of rapid test systems for determination of contaminants such as mycotoxins in food previous to or during production to be implemented into hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) systems is of crucial importance. The cutoff level or working range of a mycotoxin rapid test will usually comply with existing regulations, and these tests have the advantage of requiring a relatively small investment in equipment and personnel. However, major restrictions so far are matrix dependence, lack of appropriate specific antibodies, and, therefore, selectivity and sensitivity problems.Test strips for mycotoxins are based on a competitive immunoassay format in which a labeled antibody is used as signal reagent. Besides the classical enzyme immunoassay approach, a variety of reagents have been used for signaling, for example colored latex particles, colloidal gold particles, fluorescent labels such as, e.g., dye-loaded liposomes [17], carbon nanoparticles [18], and magnetic beads, as previously reviewed elsewhere [19]. Due to their ready availability, ease of production, and ease of conjugate formation with antibodies, colloidal gold is used in most test strips developed for mycotoxins. Colloidal gold particles with a diameter of approximately 40\u00a0nm are prepared by controlled reduction of tetrachloroauric(III) acid trihydrate with citric acid trisodium salt using the procedure described by Frens [20] and Turkevitch [21]. Because of surface plasmon resonance effects, the 40\u00a0nm colloidal gold particles have a deep red color, which is exploited for test strip signaling. Conjugation of antibodies is performed after determining, by titration, the required concentration of antibody [22], using non-covalent interactions between colloidal gold particles and proteins, i.e. dative bonding, H-bonding, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic adsorption.The test strip components such as sample pad, conjugate pad, analytical nitrocellulose membrane, and absorbent pad are immobilized on a plastic backing card for better handling. The pads which are usually of, e.g., cellulose or glass fiber material will overlap each other and the analytical membrane by a few mm in order to guarantee sample flow along the strip. The absorbent pad at the end of the strip allows absorption of excess liquid, ensuring no backflow on to the membrane (Fig.\u00a01). The signal reagent may either be mixed with sample extract in a microwell or previously immobilized on the strip on the conjugate pad. The test strip can, accordingly, be either a freestanding strip or enclosed within a plastic housing. The test strip is inserted into the well or the sample extract is applied directly to the strip (signal reagent previously immobilized) and the mixed content then migrates on to the nitrocellulose membrane, which contains a test zone and a control zone. In a competitive assay, as shown in Fig.\u00a01, mycotoxin\u2013protein conjugate coated on the test zone captures the free antibody\u2013colloidal gold particle complex, allowing color particles to concentrate and form a visible line. The intensity of the test line is dependent on the analyte concentration and may be measured with a photometric reflectance strip reader. A species-specific antibody coated on the control zone will capture loaded and unloaded antibody\u2013colloidal gold particle complex. One line will therefore always be visible in the control zone regardless of the presence of target analyte, confirming correct test development.\nFig.\u00a01Principle of competitive assay in test strip format (freestanding test strip)Gold colloid-based LFDs have been developed for the most prevalent mycotoxins, for example deoxynivalenol [23], aflatoxin B1 [24, 25], fumonisin B1 [26], ochratoxin A [27, 28], and T-2 toxin [13]. Most of the test strips developed are qualitative strips. Nevertheless, a trend can be seen towards (semi)quantitative test strips, driven by a strong demand from the industry, and towards multi-mycotoxin approaches such as a lateral-flow immunoassay for the rapid simultaneous detection of zearalenone and deoxynivalenol [29]. An increasing number of commercially available test kits for mycotoxins confirm the trend towards screening tests which are easy-to-use and allow rapid on-site decision-taking based on quantitative results. Test strip-based test kits for aflatoxins (qualitative and quantitative), deoxynivalenol (semi-quantitative and quantitative), fumonisins (qualitative and quantitative), ochratoxin A (quantitative), and zearalenone (quantitative) are commercially available. GIPSA has a test kit evaluation program to verify the performance of commercially available test kits and provides a listing on its homepage [30]. Nevertheless, problems with reproducibility, reliability with different matrices, and sensitivity may sometimes limit their application [7]. Over or underestimation of mycotoxins when using rapid tests is still an issue often attributed to cross-reactivity of the antibody to closely related fungal metabolites and/or to the matrix itself. Different matrices have been shown to have different effects on the test result, as has been previously shown not only for rapid tests but mainly for standard chromatographic mycotoxin analysis [31]. Rapid membrane-based tests do not include a clean-up step before measurement, which increases speed, although at the expense of accuracy since interfering substances in the sample extract are not removed. Maize is often a more difficult matrix than wheat, because of the higher content of co-extracted fatty components. Measurement changes obtained with maize samples may be substantial compared with wheat samples, with strong signal suppression thus affecting the regression lines [11]. Also, large differences observed between spiked samples and naturally contaminated samples contribute to calibration and validation problems. For qualitative test methods there are no general validation procedures available. Solely the cutoff level is defined as the concentration threshold below which positive identification becomes unreliable [32]. Ten replicates were used to determine the cutoff level of a T-2 toxin test strip with results showing that the test strip was selective and sensitive for the determination of T-2 toxin in wheat and oats [13]. During test strip development the following criteria must be fulfilled:\na reproducible and color-intense control line;a visual detection limit at the desired cutoff in selected commodities, with no test line visible at sample concentrations at and above the cutoff; andno background coloring of membrane due to non-specific binding of excess colloidal gold particles.Challenges include adjusting the flow properties of the test strip and, as already mentioned, reducing matrix background interference by optimization of multiple parameters including:\ntype and pore size of analytical membrane;type and concentration of blocking agent for blocking membrane binding sites after spraying of reagents;type of buffer, pH range and ionic strength; anduse of surfactants and modifiers for pre or post treatment of test strip materialsto name only test strip development itself. Test strip production showed that the blocking procedure of the NC membrane after spraying the reagent lines was a critical step for obtaining reproducible test results and ensuring longer stability of the test strips. Similar to ELISA, optimization with a selection of reagents such as BSA protein solution, fish gelatin, or conalbumin A is necessary.The quality of available antibodies is a further issue that should not be neglected [33, 34]. Antibody sensitivity and specificity will have a strong influence on the performance of the developed membrane-based immunoassay [35].One of the advantages of rapid immunoassay-based tests is that sample clean-up can be omitted. Nevertheless, sample extraction must consider both extraction efficiency of mycotoxins and solvent compatibility with the antibodies applied in the test. The organic solvent tolerance of an antibody to solvents such as methanol or acetonitrile must be tested and will determine the end concentration before performing the test. A further dilution step of the extract with buffer is usually required, otherwise, e.g., false negative signals may be obtained [13]. For the extraction of mycotoxins, mixtures of methanol and water or acetonitrile and water, which may also contain a modifier such as acetic acid, are commonly used [36]. Extraction procedures for mycotoxin analysis from agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize are known and have been described in many reviews elsewhere. Changes in extraction solvent composition such as, e.g., varying amounts of methanol or acetonitrile in a methanol\u2013water or acetonitrile\u2013water mixture have shown to strongly affect extraction efficiency [36].Last, but not least, large differences may be observed between spiked samples and naturally contaminated samples with shifts of the cutoff level in the test strip or shifts of relative reflectance readings of the test line in a quantitative test strip. The test strip optimization and validation should therefore be performed using only naturally contaminated material and a reference method, e.g. LC\u2013MS\u2013MS [36], used for sample characterization and monitoring of rapid test performance. Although limited, reference material for quality-control measurements [37] and certified reference materials are available for selected commodities and mycotoxins and should be used to confirm the trueness of developed methods [38, 39]. A maize quality-control material for the fumonisins FB1 and FB2 (Fumonisin FB1+FB2 in Maize Flour; Biopure Referenzsubstanzen, Tulln, Austria) has been used for calibration of a fumonisin test strip (n\u2009=\u20093) developed in our laboratory, as shown in Fig.\u00a02. The preliminary data presented should briefly illustrate that calibration of optimized test strips which use colloidal gold particles as detector reagent with well characterized material may enable fast quantitative detection of mycotoxins such as total fumonisins in maize (1:80 sample extraction with water) when used in combination with a photometric strip reader. The test performed with an extraction time of only 3\u00a0min and a test time of 3\u00a0min underlines the rapidity and ease of use of test strips for mycotoxins.\nFig.\u00a02Relative reflectance value of the screened test line of a total fumonisin test strip versus the total fumonisin concentration in solution of the extracted maize quality-control material (2406\u2009\u00b1\u2009612\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u22121 FB1 and 630\u2009\u00b1\u2009116\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u22121 FB2) (n\u2009=\u20093). The naturally contaminated maize extract (1:80 with water, therefore 2000\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u22121 corresponding to 25\u00a0\u03bcg L\u22121) was mixed with blank maize extract (1:80 with water). Further dilution steps were used when sample concentrations were higherIn the last decade, the demand for rapid tests which can be easily integrated into raw material selection or the production chain, e.g. into HACCP protocols, has increased in the food and feed sector. Gold colloid-based immunochromatographic test strips for the detection of mycotoxins fulfill many requirements, being fast, easy to handle, and allowing on-site pre-screening.OutlookEstablished state-of-the-art chromatography-based methods for determination of mycotoxins are increasingly being complemented by a number of methods for fast and cost-effective analysis, including rapid test strips. Although problems in test strip development such as insufficient sensitivity, selectivity, or strong matrix dependence may remain, high-quality test strips are rapidly emerging and complementing classical detection methods in which rapid screening is needed. Because the price for simplification is usually lower sensitivity, obtaining extremely good antibodies will remain a major requirement for easy-to-use assays. The optimization and validation of innovative test strips will contribute to meeting contract or legislative specifications for maximum acceptable levels of mycotoxins in foods and feed through effective and rapid screening.References1.DelmulleBSDe SaegerSMDGSibandaLBarna-VetroIVan PeteghemCHJ Agric Food Chem2005533364336810.1021/jf04048041:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXjtVWhu70%3D2.JECFA (2001) Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives, 56th meeting, Geneva, Switzerland, 6\u201315 February 20013.European Commission Regulation No 1881/2006 Off J Eur Union L364:5\u2013244.European Commission Recommendation No 2006/576/EC Off J Eur Union L229:7\u201395.FAO (2006) Worldwide regulations for mycotoxins in food and feed in 2003.

        "txt": "Introduction. Rapid diagnostic assays have been in use for decades in the clinical and medical sector with, e.g., the pregnancy test strip as one of the first commercially available test strips with widespread use. In the last decade, rapid immunoassay-based tests have also increasingly been used in the food and feed sector, where applications range from the screening for foodborne pathogens, drug residues, antibiotics, and mycotoxins, to allergens and, recently, genetically modified organisms. Amongst these, tests for mycotoxins which allow screening of agricultural commodities with results within 15\u00a0min are gaining acceptance and are being firmly integrated into routine quality-monitoring procedures, because of the need for rapid on-site (pre)-screening [1].Mycotoxins are toxic natural secondary metabolites produced by several species of fungus, for example Aspergillus and Fusarium, on agricultural commodities in the field or during storage. These toxins cause food- and feed-borne intoxication, and many are cytotoxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or immunosuppressive [2]. Due to the health risks for humans and animals, authorities such as the European Commission or the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) have addressed the mycotoxin problem by adopting regulatory limits. Regulations are in force for, e.g., aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and Fusarium toxins in selected foodstuffs (EC 1881/2006) [3], and there are recommendations for maximum levels of mycotoxins in feed (EC 2006/576/EC) [4]. In the United States, action levels or advisory levels are in force for, e.g., aflatoxins and deoxynivalenol, respectively [5].Besides validated official analytical methods for mycotoxin detection based on chromatographic principles [6, 7], rapid screening tests and a number of new techniques such as biosensors are rapidly emerging [8\u201310]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have become a standard tool for rapid monitoring of mycotoxins. Despite a high matrix dependence, microtiter plate ELISAs offer the advantages of speed, ease of operation, sensitivity, and high sample throughput. Nevertheless, faster and more straightforward immunoassay-based tests are preferentially used for applications where on-site use is necessary, because they allow rapid turnover. Fluorescence polarization immunoassays have been developed for mycotoxins such as DON, ZON, and aflatoxins [11] and are commercially available. These instrument-based assays are enzyme-free and homogeneous and make use of a mycotoxin-fluorophore conjugate such as a fluorescein tracer. Such rapid methods for analysis of mycotoxins have been reviewed elsewhere [12]. Rapid disposable membrane-based assay tests have been developed in multiple formats, for example test strips [13], flow-through tests [14], and dip sticks [15, 16]. Dip sticks work like an ELISA, with carrier membranes instead of microtiter plates. But similar to ELISA, the performance of one to four working steps such as washing, blocking, sample incubation, and staining requires a total time of 30\u00a0min to 3\u00a0h to obtain the test results, which cannot compete with a 5\u201310\u00a0min test strip. Flow-through membrane-based immunoassays are comparable with lateral-flow test strips in rapidity and ease of use. But these are qualitative or semi-quantitative tests and interpretation of results may be difficult when the test result is close to the cutoff level [12]. Although dip sticks and flow-through immunoassays have been developed for mycotoxins, they are not as commercially successful as test strips. This review will therefore focus on membrane-based test strips, also called lateral-flow devices (LFDs).Lateral-flow devicesLFDs are based on a test format which includes sample flow along an analytical nitrocellulose membrane due to capillary forces and enables fast and easy-to-handle immunoassays which can be both qualitative with a defined cutoff level or quantitative when used with a photometric strip reader. The development of rapid test systems for determination of contaminants such as mycotoxins in food previous to or during production to be implemented into hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) systems is of crucial importance. The cutoff level or working range of a mycotoxin rapid test will usually comply with existing regulations, and these tests have the advantage of requiring a relatively small investment in equipment and personnel. However, major restrictions so far are matrix dependence, lack of appropriate specific antibodies, and, therefore, selectivity and sensitivity problems.Test strips for mycotoxins are based on a competitive immunoassay format in which a labeled antibody is used as signal reagent. Besides the classical enzyme immunoassay approach, a variety of reagents have been used for signaling, for example colored latex particles, colloidal gold particles, fluorescent labels such as, e.g., dye-loaded liposomes [17], carbon nanoparticles [18], and magnetic beads, as previously reviewed elsewhere [19]. Due to their ready availability, ease of production, and ease of conjugate formation with antibodies, colloidal gold is used in most test strips developed for mycotoxins. Colloidal gold particles with a diameter of approximately 40\u00a0nm are prepared by controlled reduction of tetrachloroauric(III) acid trihydrate with citric acid trisodium salt using the procedure described by Frens [20] and Turkevitch [21]. Because of surface plasmon resonance effects, the 40\u00a0nm colloidal gold particles have a deep red color, which is exploited for test strip signaling. Conjugation of antibodies is performed after determining, by titration, the required concentration of antibody [22], using non-covalent interactions between colloidal gold particles and proteins, i.e. dative bonding, H-bonding, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic adsorption.The test strip components such as sample pad, conjugate pad, analytical nitrocellulose membrane, and absorbent pad are immobilized on a plastic backing card for better handling. The pads which are usually of, e.g., cellulose or glass fiber material will overlap each other and the analytical membrane by a few mm in order to guarantee sample flow along the strip. The absorbent pad at the end of the strip allows absorption of excess liquid, ensuring no backflow on to the membrane (Fig.\u00a01). The signal reagent may either be mixed with sample extract in a microwell or previously immobilized on the strip on the conjugate pad. The test strip can, accordingly, be either a freestanding strip or enclosed within a plastic housing. The test strip is inserted into the well or the sample extract is applied directly to the strip (signal reagent previously immobilized) and the mixed content then migrates on to the nitrocellulose membrane, which contains a test zone and a control zone. In a competitive assay, as shown in Fig.\u00a01, mycotoxin\u2013protein conjugate coated on the test zone captures the free antibody\u2013colloidal gold particle complex, allowing color particles to concentrate and form a visible line. The intensity of the test line is dependent on the analyte concentration and may be measured with a photometric reflectance strip reader. A species-specific antibody coated on the control zone will capture loaded and unloaded antibody\u2013colloidal gold particle complex. One line will therefore always be visible in the control zone regardless of the presence of target analyte, confirming correct test development.\nFig.\u00a01Principle of competitive assay in test strip format (freestanding test strip)Gold colloid-based LFDs have been developed for the most prevalent mycotoxins, for example deoxynivalenol [23], aflatoxin B1 [24, 25], fumonisin B1 [26], ochratoxin A [27, 28], and T-2 toxin [13]. Most of the test strips developed are qualitative strips. Nevertheless, a trend can be seen towards (semi)quantitative test strips, driven by a strong demand from the industry, and towards multi-mycotoxin approaches such as a lateral-flow immunoassay for the rapid simultaneous detection of zearalenone and deoxynivalenol [29]. An increasing number of commercially available test kits for mycotoxins confirm the trend towards screening tests which are easy-to-use and allow rapid on-site decision-taking based on quantitative results. Test strip-based test kits for aflatoxins (qualitative and quantitative), deoxynivalenol (semi-quantitative and quantitative), fumonisins (qualitative and quantitative), ochratoxin A (quantitative), and zearalenone (quantitative) are commercially available. GIPSA has a test kit evaluation program to verify the performance of commercially available test kits and provides a listing on its homepage [30]. Nevertheless, problems with reproducibility, reliability with different matrices, and sensitivity may sometimes limit their application [7]. Over or underestimation of mycotoxins when using rapid tests is still an issue often attributed to cross-reactivity of the antibody to closely related fungal metabolites and/or to the matrix itself. Different matrices have been shown to have different effects on the test result, as has been previously shown not only for rapid tests but mainly for standard chromatographic mycotoxin analysis [31]. Rapid membrane-based tests do not include a clean-up step before measurement, which increases speed, although at the expense of accuracy since interfering substances in the sample extract are not removed. Maize is often a more difficult matrix than wheat, because of the higher content of co-extracted fatty components. Measurement changes obtained with maize samples may be substantial compared with wheat samples, with strong signal suppression thus affecting the regression lines [11]. Also, large differences observed between spiked samples and naturally contaminated samples contribute to calibration and validation problems. For qualitative test methods there are no general validation procedures available. Solely the cutoff level is defined as the concentration threshold below which positive identification becomes unreliable [32]. Ten replicates were used to determine the cutoff level of a T-2 toxin test strip with results showing that the test strip was selective and sensitive for the determination of T-2 toxin in wheat and oats [13]. During test strip development the following criteria must be fulfilled:\na reproducible and color-intense control line;a visual detection limit at the desired cutoff in selected commodities, with no test line visible at sample concentrations at and above the cutoff; andno background coloring of membrane due to non-specific binding of excess colloidal gold particles.Challenges include adjusting the flow properties of the test strip and, as already mentioned, reducing matrix background interference by optimization of multiple parameters including:\ntype and pore size of analytical membrane;type and concentration of blocking agent for blocking membrane binding sites after spraying of reagents;type of buffer, pH range and ionic strength; anduse of surfactants and modifiers for pre or post treatment of test strip materialsto name only test strip development itself. Test strip production showed that the blocking procedure of the NC membrane after spraying the reagent lines was a critical step for obtaining reproducible test results and ensuring longer stability of the test strips. Similar to ELISA, optimization with a selection of reagents such as BSA protein solution, fish gelatin, or conalbumin A is necessary.The quality of available antibodies is a further issue that should not be neglected [33, 34]. Antibody sensitivity and specificity will have a strong influence on the performance of the developed membrane-based immunoassay [35].One of the advantages of rapid immunoassay-based tests is that sample clean-up can be omitted. Nevertheless, sample extraction must consider both extraction efficiency of mycotoxins and solvent compatibility with the antibodies applied in the test. The organic solvent tolerance of an antibody to solvents such as methanol or acetonitrile must be tested and will determine the end concentration before performing the test. A further dilution step of the extract with buffer is usually required, otherwise, e.g., false negative signals may be obtained [13]. For the extraction of mycotoxins, mixtures of methanol and water or acetonitrile and water, which may also contain a modifier such as acetic acid, are commonly used [36]. Extraction procedures for mycotoxin analysis from agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize are known and have been described in many reviews elsewhere. Changes in extraction solvent composition such as, e.g., varying amounts of methanol or acetonitrile in a methanol\u2013water or acetonitrile\u2013water mixture have shown to strongly affect extraction efficiency [36].Last, but not least, large differences may be observed between spiked samples and naturally contaminated samples with shifts of the cutoff level in the test strip or shifts of relative reflectance readings of the test line in a quantitative test strip. The test strip optimization and validation should therefore be performed using only naturally contaminated material and a reference method, e.g. LC\u2013MS\u2013MS [36], used for sample characterization and monitoring of rapid test performance. Although limited, reference material for quality-control measurements [37] and certified reference materials are available for selected commodities and mycotoxins and should be used to confirm the trueness of developed methods [38, 39]. A maize quality-control material for the fumonisins FB1 and FB2 (Fumonisin FB1+FB2 in Maize Flour; Biopure Referenzsubstanzen, Tulln, Austria) has been used for calibration of a fumonisin test strip (n\u2009=\u20093) developed in our laboratory, as shown in Fig.\u00a02. The preliminary data presented should briefly illustrate that calibration of optimized test strips which use colloidal gold particles as detector reagent with well characterized material may enable fast quantitative detection of mycotoxins such as total fumonisins in maize (1:80 sample extraction with water) when used in combination with a photometric strip reader. The test performed with an extraction time of only 3\u00a0min and a test time of 3\u00a0min underlines the rapidity and ease of use of test strips for mycotoxins.\nFig.\u00a02Relative reflectance value of the screened test line of a total fumonisin test strip versus the total fumonisin concentration in solution of the extracted maize quality-control material (2406\u2009\u00b1\u2009612\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u22121 FB1 and 630\u2009\u00b1\u2009116\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u22121 FB2) (n\u2009=\u20093). The naturally contaminated maize extract (1:80 with water, therefore 2000\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u22121 corresponding to 25\u00a0\u03bcg L\u22121) was mixed with blank maize extract (1:80 with water). Further dilution steps were used when sample concentrations were higherIn the last decade, the demand for rapid tests which can be easily integrated into raw material selection or the production chain, e.g. into HACCP protocols, has increased in the food and feed sector. Gold colloid-based immunochromatographic test strips for the detection of mycotoxins fulfill many requirements, being fast, easy to handle, and allowing on-site pre-screening.OutlookEstablished state-of-the-art chromatography-based methods for determination of mycotoxins are increasingly being complemented by a number of methods for fast and cost-effective analysis, including rapid test strips. Although problems in test strip development such as insufficient sensitivity, selectivity, or strong matrix dependence may remain, high-quality test strips are rapidly emerging and complementing classical detection methods in which rapid screening is needed. Because the price for simplification is usually lower sensitivity, obtaining extremely good antibodies will remain a major requirement for easy-to-use assays. The optimization and validation of innovative test strips will contribute to meeting contract or legislative specifications for maximum acceptable levels of mycotoxins in foods and feed through effective and rapid screening.References1.DelmulleBSDe SaegerSMDGSibandaLBarna-VetroIVan PeteghemCHJ Agric Food Chem2005533364336810.1021/jf04048041:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXjtVWhu70%3D2.JECFA (2001) Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives, 56th meeting, Geneva, Switzerland, 6\u201315 February 20013.European Commission Regulation No 1881/2006 Off J Eur Union L364:5\u2013244.European Commission Recommendation No 2006/576/EC Off J Eur Union L229:7\u201395.FAO (2006) Worldwide regulations for mycotoxins in food and feed in 2003.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe development of an electrochemical DNA-biosensor that can be used to sense in vivo oxidative damage to DNA is of crucial importance. In a health preventing perspective, detection of in vivo oxidative damage to DNA can be very useful for screening and evaluating the effect caused to DNA by carcinogens and oxidising substances in general, for which voltammetric methods are an inexpensive and faster detection procedure. On the other hand, the interpretation of electrochemical data can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism by which DNA is oxidatively damaged by such substances in an approach to the real action scenario that occurs in the living cell .\nInteractions of several substances with double helix DNA have been successfully studied using a recently-developed voltammetric DNA-biosensor . This DNA-biosensor allowed the clarification not only of the specific interaction of some drugs with a certain DNA base but also of the electrochemical mechanism of the interaction .\nAdriamycin, Scheme 1 , is an antibiotic of the family of anthracyclines with a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic applications and anti-neoplasic action but that causes cardiotoxicity that ranges from a delayed and insidious cardiomyopathy to irreversible heart failure . Although, its anti-tumour properties are known for more than 30 years , its mode of in vivo action is not yet fully understood . Efforts for establishing its mechanisms of action are still an important goal to improve its administration and explain anti-cancer activity.\nThere is experimental evidence that adriamycin can promote oxidative damage to DNA in cancerous cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species and high levels of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a known biomarker of oxidative stress, were detected in in vitro studies . The generation of this main product of guanine oxidation within DNA is strongly mutagenic and can contribute to cell disfunction .\nSince 1972 there is ample evidence demonstrated by X-ray crystallography and other methods that adriamycin and analogous anthracycline compounds interact with dsDNA through intercalation and adriamycin actively accumulates in nuclear genome , but less is known as to whether it can directly oxidise dsDNA after intercalation has occurred. In aqueous solution with low salt concentration B-DNA predominates and this is the structure into which intercalation occurs .\nWhen intercalated in double helix DNA, the rings B and C of the adriamycin core, Scheme 1, intercalate between DNA base pairs preferentially, but not in a sequence specific way, at CpG homologous sequences . The aminosugar and the carbonyl side chain linked to ring A remain in the minor groove of the double helix and ring D protrudes into the major groove . The positively charged aminosugar in the amino function interacts with the dsDNA phosphate backbone and is fundamental in intercalation and binding affinities with dsDNA .\nIn this context, the aim of the present paper is concerned with the study of the interaction of adriamycin in situ with dsDNA at a charged interface using a dsDNA-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The possibility that adriamycin intercalated to double helix DNA reacts specifically with the guanine moiety and leads to adriamycin\u2013guanine interaction and formation of the mutagenic 8-oxoG is discussed and a mechanism proposed.\nThe experimental results presented here will give strong evidence that adriamycin can undergo oxidation or reduction after being intercalated into the DNA double helix. Polarographic techniques have been used previously to study the formation of the adriamycin\u2013dsDNA complex in bulk solution . Electrochemical activity for the adriamycin structurally related compound daunomycin intercalated with DNA was also observed using a carbon paste electrode . The results obtained in this work with the dsDNA-modified GCE lead to the conclusion that the electroactive character of the adriamycin\u2013DNA complex depends also on the conformation and orientation of the double helix, parallel or perpendicular, in relation to the electrode surface.\nAdriamycin (Doxorubicin hydrochloride, 2 mg ml\u22121 solution) obtained from Pharma-APS, and sodium salt calf thymus DNA (type II), 8-oxoG, guanine (G), guanosine (Guo) and adenine (A) from Sigma, were used without further purification. Solutions of different concentrations of adriamycin were prepared in pH 4.5 0.1 M acetate buffer electrolyte. All solutions were prepared using analytical grade reagents and purified water from a Millipore Milli-Q system (conductivity <0.1 \u03bcs cm\u22121).\nNitrogen and oxygen saturated solutions were obtained by bubbling high purity N2 or O2 in the solution for 10 min and continuing with a flow of the pure gas over the solution during the voltammetric experiments.\nAll voltammetric experiments were done using an \u03bcAutolab running with GPES version 4.8 software, Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands. A GCE (d=6 mm) working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference, were used in a 5 cm3 one-compartment electrochemical cell. The experimental conditions unless stated otherwise were: cyclic voltammetry, scan rate 2 V s\u22121; differential pulse voltammetry, pulse amplitude 50 mV, pulse width 70 ms, scan rate 5 mV s\u22121. All potentials are referred to SCE.\nMicrovolumes were measured using EP-10 and EP-100 Plus Motorized Microliter Pippettes (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, USA). The pH measurements were carried out with a Crison micropH 2001 pH-meter with an Ingold combined glass electrode. All the experiments were done at room temperature.\nOrigin (version 6.0) from Microcal Software was used for the presentation of all the experimental voltammograms and graphs reported in this work. When necessary, the experimental voltammograms were smoothed using a Savitsky\u2013Golay smoothing algorithm.\nThe antibiotic adriamycin, as mentioned earlier, can be oxidised and reduced at a GCE. The reduction of adriamycin occurs at the 5,12-diquinone groups in the anthracycline chromophore and the oxidation at the 6,11-dihidroquinone-functionality , as shown in the cyclic voltammogram, Fig. 1 , where the concentration and scan rate applied are both very high. Both electron transfer reactions are pH-dependent.\nThe reduction of adriamycin follows a reversible complex mechanism and during reduction a semiquinone radical, which is very reactive with oxygen, is formed. The reduction of the 5,12-diquinone group in adriamycin occurs at potentials of \u22120.40 and \u22120.60 V at pH 4.5, and differential pulse voltammograms show that the I p,a values are dependent on the presence of O2 in solution, Fig. 2 . Reversible behaviour is very clear in the absence of oxygen, after nitrogen is bubbled into the solution for 10 min before scanning. Multi-step electron transfer occurred in a normal atmosphere or in an oxygen-saturated solution, Fig. 2. In this figure, the reduction and oxidation differential pulse voltammograms were background subtracted and offset so that the reduction and subsequent oxidation processes could be compared. The vertical position of the voltammograms has been altered to make comparison easier.\nThe catalytic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), at \u22120.42 V, by adriamycin involves formation of the semiquinone radical intermediate that reduces molecular oxygen to the superoxide radical followed by regeneration of the quinone function moiety, at \u22120.47 V . This homogeneous adriamycin\u2013O2 redox-cycling process increases ROS generation without adriamycin consumption, occurs in vivo and can be detected in situ electrochemically by the significant increase of the reduction, peak at \u22120.42 V, and oxidation, peak at \u22120.49 V, in the differential pulse voltammograms obtained in saturated oxygen solutions, Fig. 2.\nThe presence of O2 does not interfere with the oxidation of the 6,11-dihidroquinone functionality . As expected, the oxidation peak current has not changed, Fig. 3 a, in the differential pulse voltammograms obtained with the same electrode placed in supporting electrolyte saturated with N2 or with O2. This is important because all the oxidation studies and the electrochemical detection of adriamycin interaction with dsDNA are carried out in contact with normal atmosphere.\nThe electrochemical oxidation at a bare GCE of 8-oxoG, guanine, guanosine, adenine, and dsDNA was briefly revisited in order to make it easier to identify the peaks that occur after adriamycin\u2013dsDNA interaction. The differential pulse voltammograms are shown in Fig. 4 . The oxidation peaks for 8-oxoG (E p=+0.45 V), guanine (E p=+0.75 V), guanosine (E p=+0.96 V) and adenine (E p=+1.05 V), show a good separation between most species. However, for guanosine (E p=+0.96 V) and adenine (E p=+1.05 V) there is little difference between the peak potentials and a considerable peak overlap occurs when both are present in the same solution. This means greater difficulty in their identification when the two species exist together. As already described for dsDNA no oxidation peaks were found in the first voltammogram and only after a long adsorption time, the 40th voltammogram, tiny shoulders appeared.\nTo study electrochemically the adriamycin\u2013dsDNA interaction three different modifications of the GCE were used: a thick layer of dsDNA on the GCE, a thin layer of dsDNA on GCE and adriamycin adsorbed onto GCE.\nA thick layer of dsDNA, 100 \u03bcl from a dsDNA concentrated solution (30 mg ml\u22121), was placed on top of a GCE surface, previously polished and electrochemically conditioned in supporting electrolyte, and allowed to dry . This thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was placed in the solution with adriamycin.\nThe oxidation of adriamycin at the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was investigated, Fig. 5 , and the effect of the time of immersion of the modified GCE in 1 \u03bcM adriamycin solution was compared with the results obtained at a bare GCE. In Fig. 3b is shown the voltammogram obtained in buffer for oxidation of 1 \u03bcM adriamycin accumulated onto the bare GCE by chemisorption . With a bare GCE, Fig. 3a, one adriamycin oxidation peak, E p=+0.50 V vs. SCE, with peak width at half height, W 1/2, close to 91 mV, was found by differential pulse voltammetry at pH 4.5. No differences were found for the values of E p and W 1/2 for a 1 \u03bcM adriamycin solution Fig. 5a, when using a thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE. However, it was possible to pre-concentrate adriamycin on the thick layer of DNA and the peak current was found to increase with time and to reach saturation after 1 h of immersion, see insert Fig. 5a and the same occurred with the bare GCE.\nGood reproducibility was observed in the values of differential pulse peak current found for the same period of immersion of the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE in adriamycin solution for the first scan. An abrupt decrease in peak current was always observed in the second scan, Fig. 5b, suggesting a fast consumption of the adriamycin on the surface. This behaviour was found to be reproducible, and a progressive decrease in peak current for the first scan after repeating the 5 min immersion period was also observed. No identifiable peaks due to DNA base oxidation were registered under these voltammetric conditions.\nAs discussed, the reduction of adriamycin follows a reversible complex mechanism and during reduction in an oxygen saturated solution the formation of the semiquinone reactive radical resulting from the adriamycin\u2013O2 cyclic catalytic interaction could be followed, Fig. 2.\nThe thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was used to study electrochemically the changes in the DNA film caused by the adriamycin radical reacting with O2 formed after in situ reduction of adriamycin. In Fig. 6 are differential pulse voltammograms in acetate buffer electrolyte obtained with a bare GCE immersed in an adriamycin solution and with a thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE previously immersed in an adriamycin solution during 10 min, in a normal atmosphere. In the latter case, before introduction in the acetate buffer solution the modified electrode was gently washed with deionised water to assure the removal of adriamycin that was not intercalated in the dsDNA film. In this way, the voltammetric peaks can only result from adriamycin incorporated into the dsDNA thick film without any contribution from diffusion, as they are obtained in supporting electrolyte. In Fig. 6, the same procedure is used as in Fig. 2, the reduction and oxidation differential pulse voltammograms were background subtracted and offset so that the reduction and subsequent oxidation processes could be compared. The vertical position of the voltammograms has been altered to make comparison easier.\nAdriamycin adsorbs irreversibly to the GCE surface and it is always necessary to polish and clean the GCE surface very well. When using the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE it was not necessary to clean the glassy carbon surface after the removal of the dsDNA film. This is a confirmation that all the adriamycin was intercalated inside the thick layer dsDNA film and did not reach the electrode surface. Therefore, the results shown correspond to the signal obtained from adriamycin that was intercalated into the dsDNA thick layer without any contribution from adriamycin in the bulk solution because the experiment was performed only in supporting electrolyte.\nThe differential pulse voltammograms for the reduction of adriamycin at a bare GCE, Fig. 2, showed three consecutive peaks, at \u22120.43, \u22120.53 and \u22120.58 V, whereas at the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE, Fig. 6, only two peaks occur, at \u22120.38 (peak 3) and \u22120.58 V (peak 4), indicating a different mechanism. In the anodic scan, from \u22120.70 to 0.00 V, at the bare GCE there is one very broad peak for the oxidation of adriamycin, peak 1 at \u22120.55 V, whereas at the thick layer DNA-modified GCE, two broad peaks occur, peak 1 at \u22120.60, and a new peak at \u22120.45 V, peak 2, Fig. 6.\nComparing Fig. 6 with the results presented in Fig. 2, the new peak 2 at \u22120.45 V can be attributed to the adriamycin\u2013guanine site interaction in the DNA, resulting in a charge transfer reaction that leads to formation of a guanine radical cation and adriamycin semiquinone, Scheme 2 . In Fig. 6, using the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE, peak 1 occurs at \u22120.60 V, and corresponds to the oxidation of the free adriamycin reduced quinone group, peak 1 at \u22120.55 V in Fig. 2, that is shifted to more negative potential values due to the electrode modification with dsDNA.\nAs mentioned the oxidation peak potential of the 6,11-dihidroquinone-functionality showed no difference when a thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was used, Fig. 5, and it was even possible to concentrate adriamycin onto the DNA thick layer although no interaction with DNA was observed, independently of the time of immersion.\nHowever, if a potential of \u22120.60 V was applied to the dsDNA-modified electrode during 120 s, big changes occurred inside the DNA layer, Fig. 7 . Two new oxidation peaks appeared, that can be identified : the first at +0.80 V, as guanine oxidation, and the second at +1.05 V, most probably as adenine oxidation, Fig. 4. Nevertheless, the oxidation peak potentials for guanosine and adenine are very close, Fig. 4, and this makes their identification difficult. As adriamycin intercalates between DNA base pairs preferentially at CpG homologous sequences is understandable that peaks for guanine and guanosine will occur. However, it is also possible that adenine molecules in the unfolded strand reach the electrode. The broad peak observed probably includes a contribution from both guanosine and adenine, but it is not possible to obtain two separate peaks.\nAdriamycin can undergo a reaction beginning with the transfer of a single electron to the quinone portion of the adriamycin ring system, generating a free radical . A mechanism of guanine oxidation, after adriamycin intercalation within double helix DNA , by the very reactive adriamycin radical formed at \u22120.60 V is proposed in Scheme 2 and is in agreement with results obtained by other methods . Besides these two new peaks, the oxidation peak of adriamycin became broader, the peak width at half height, W 1/2, being greater than that obtained for adriamycin, and appeared at E p=+0.45 V, a peak potential 50 mV less positive than for adriamycin alone, shifted towards the potential for 8-oxoG oxidation, Fig. 4 . Following Scheme 2, this peak can be related with the interaction between adriamycin and 8-oxoG formed after adriamycin intercalation in DNA in guanine-rich regions .\nA thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE was prepared by immersing the GCE in a 60 \u03bcg ml\u22121 dsDNA solution at +0.40 V applied potential during 10 min, a similar procedure as has been used with ssDNA on carbon paste electrodes . In this electrode modification a non-uniform thin layer of dsDNA is adsorbed onto the GCE leaving many bare glassy carbon uncovered regions. This thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE was immersed during 3 min in an adriamycin solution, rinsed with water, and afterwards transferred to buffer, where differential pulse voltammetry was performed. Results in acetate buffer, Fig. 8 , showed different features. Without applying a negative potential only the peak for adriamycin oxidation at +0.50 V occurs. After applying the potential of \u22120.60 V during 60 s, the oxidation peak for guanine, at +0.84 V, and the oxidation peak for 8-oxoG in the unfolded strand, at +0.38 V, also appeared.\nThese results are in agreement with those with the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE. The clear separation of the adriamycin and 8-oxoG peaks can be explained by the non-uniform coverage of the electrode surface by DNA and adsorption of adriamycin on the uncovered glassy carbon. This is very important as it enables the use of the less positive peak of oxidation of 8-oxoG to detect DNA damage, which can only be achieved with the thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE.\nHowever, it is not possible to detect the adriamycin\u2013DNA damage by monitoring only changes in the adriamycin oxidation peak. The damage to immobilised dsDNA causes the appearance of oxidation peaks from DNA bases and this should always be measured and taken into account. In fact, this is the drawback of the thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE since it leads to two contributions from simple adsorbed analyte and damage to immobilised DNA which needs to be carefully distinguished.\nIt is interesting to take advantage of adriamycin's strong and irreversible adsorption on the glassy carbon surface. In Fig. 3b, the voltammogram in buffer shows the accumulation of adriamycin onto a bare GCE. An adriamycin adsorbed-modified GCE could be prepared by immersing the electrode in an adriamycin solution for a short period of time with or without deposition potential applied. To prepare the adriamycin adsorbed-modified GCE used here the GCE was immersed in a 5 \u03bcM adriamycin solution for 10 min at a deposition potential of +0.40 V, and was then always rinsed thoroughly with water before transferring to the DNA solution where the voltammetric measurements were done. As before, the reduction of the chemisorbed adriamycin was always investigated and the voltammograms were obtained in buffer solution without adriamycin in solution so as to have no contribution from bulk analyte diffusion. The effect of the presence of O2 (supporting electrolyte saturated with O2) and absence (supporting electrolyte saturated with N2) on the voltammetric behaviour of the adsorbed layer of adriamycin was also investigated. The results confirmed the strong dependence of the reduction reaction of adsorbed adriamycin on the presence of oxygen, and no influence on the oxidation, described earlier with adriamycin in solution, Figs. 2 and 3a, respectively.\nAt the adriamycin adsorbed-modified GCE, adriamycin was confined to the electrode surface and the total surface concentration of adriamycin was calculated using, \u0393adr=4RTIp,a/n2F2A\u03bd, to be \u0393 adr=2.57\u00d710\u221210 mol cm\u22122 .\nThe interaction with DNA in solution was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry, Fig. 9 . The first scan shows a big peak corresponding to the oxidation of the adsorbed adriamycin and other peaks attributed to DNA purine bases oxidation can also be seen. This is indicative that even adriamycin chemisorbed to the electrode surface intercalates with DNA that diffuses from solution, causing distortion of the double strand and allowing the oxidation of the purine bases.\nA subsequent differential pulse voltammogram obtained after application of 0.00 V for 60 s shows a drastic decrease in the adriamycin oxidation peak, Fig. 9, besides the peaks already mentioned for the oxidation of the purine bases. This decrease in the adriamycin oxidation peak is explained easily because the only adriamycin existing on the electrode surface has reacted intercalating with DNA, so the 6,11-dihydroquinone functionality is not available any more to react at the electrode surface.\nHowever, if after the first scan a potential of \u22120.60 V is applied during 60 s, a broad peak, at +0.40 V, appears, Fig. 9. This peak can be identified, as in Fig. 7, with the interaction between adriamycin and 8-oxoG formed after adriamycin intercalation in DNA in guanine-rich regions , in agreement with the proposed mechanism, Scheme 2.\nThe adriamycin reduction clearly conditions the adriamycin\u2013dsDNA interaction and this was shown using the three different modifications of the GCE: a thick layer of dsDNA onto GCE, a thin layer of dsDNA onto GCE and adriamycin adsorbed onto GCE.\nAdriamycin reduction occurs inside the dsDNA thick layer and the radical formed can interact with DNA in situ and the products be retained in the DNA layer. The reaction of O2 with adriamycin at the electrode surface should also be considered. It is not expected that the concentration of O2 in the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE is sufficiently large to explain the similar peak split observed in O2-saturated solutions. Therefore, this must be explained by considering that the reduced adriamycin reactive radical interacts with nucleotides of the DNA in which it is intercalated in a similar fashion to the adriamycin\u2013O2 mechanism which occurs in O2-saturated solutions. Thus, this reduced adriamycin radical interaction with DNA is responsible for the changes in DNA, always detected after the conditioning potential of \u22120.60 V was applied. In fact, the thick-layer dsDNA-modified GCE is a multi-layer film of DNA gel covering the glassy carbon surface completely and uniformly with no pinholes or GCE uncovered regions. Since the experiments were carried out in buffer, the peaks recorded for the reduction or oxidation of adriamycin can only be attributed to the reaction of adriamycin molecules that are inside the thick film of dsDNA.\nThe results presented here give experimental electrochemical evidence that adriamycin intercalates in double helix DNA and can oxidatively damage DNA, leading to the generation of 8-oxoG. Electrochemical in situ generation of adriamycin semiquinone radical at \u22120.60 V permits a detailed study of this interaction mechanism. In Scheme 2 is shown the proposed mechanism for the generation of 8-oxoG when a negative conditioning potential is applied, by intercalation of adriamycin into the double helix DNA.\nIn the configuration of Scheme 2 both adriamycin electroactive functional groups (the oxidisable hydroquinone group in ring B, and the reducible quinone function in ring C) are intercalated between the base pairs in the DNA\u2013adriamycin complex in close interaction with the GC base pair. The reducible quinone group in ring C protrudes slightly into the major groove, and this enables in situ (in helix) generation of an adriamycin radical within the double helix. Therefore, a redox reaction between adriamycin and guanine residues inside the double helix of DNA can be considered, in order to explain the experimental data.\n8-Oxoguanine is the main product of guanine oxidation, but the mechanistic pathway involving two electrons and two protons depends on the chemical environment surrounding guanine. Contrary to the oxidation of free guanine in solution, in the biopolymer, deprotonation of the guanine radical cation is partially prevented by base-stacking interactions with cytosine, and the hydrolysis reaction is most favourable to occur in double helix DNA .\nThe formation of adriamycin\u2013DNA adducts has been reported and the hypothesis that their formation involves redox reactions between intercalated adriamycin and base pairs must be taken into account in the light of the present results. In fact, the transitory generation of the guanine cation radical close to the adriamycin semiquinone radical cation may result in an adriamycin-base adduct formation that competes with the hydrolysis step. The intercalation may cause sufficient distortion of the dsDNA to expose the radical cation to hydrolysis. This would lead to the transient formation of a 8-hydroxy-7,8-dihydropurin-7-yl radical, the likely precursor of 8-oxoG inside the double helix .\nWhen a potential of \u22120.6 V is applied, adriamycin is reduced and this redox process occurs within the DNA double helix and involves the simultaneous oxidation of one neighbouring guanine residue. In this way, electron transfer from the guanine moiety to the quinone without hydrogen abstraction is likely to be the predominant reaction leading to the formation of the guanine cation. Due to the fast hydrolysis of the radical cation, the semiquinone undergoes further reduction to the fully reduced adriamycin and the formation of 8-oxoG occurs, instead of being reoxidised, as would happen in O2-saturated solution. So the hydrolysis step is followed by a second electron transfer and leads to the ultimate formation of 8-oxoG and reduced adriamycin.\nFinally, the \u03c0-stacked base pairs characteristic of double helix DNA might serve as a pathway for charge transport mediating the redox reaction between adriamycin radicals, generated during reduction, and guanine residues in the double helix. The trapping by water of the generated radical cation leads to in situ formation of the oxidative DNA damage product 8-oxoG. Further oxidation of 8-oxoG could lead to hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond generating an abasic site . This could disrupt the double helix causing strand break, exposing 8-oxoG residues and other purines to the electrode surface that can then be oxidised.\nElectrochemical voltammetric in situ sensing of DNA oxidative damage caused by reduced adriamycin intercalated into DNA was possible using the dsDNA film-modified GCE. The results indicate that adriamycin intercalated in double helix DNA can undergo oxidation or reduction and reacts specifically with the guanine moiety, and thence to the formation of mutagenic 8-oxoG residues. A model for this electrochemically observed in situ oxidative damage was proposed and may be used to explain the levels of 8-oxoG found when cells are treated with adriamycin as well as its well-known free radical activity.\nThis is very relevant because the mechanism of interaction of DNA\u2013adriamycin at charged interfaces mimics better the in vivo DNA\u2013adriamycin complex situation, where it is expected that DNA is in close contact with charged phospholipid membranes and proteins, rather than when the interaction is in solution. The results presented contribute with a possible mechanism through which adriamycin can cause direct in vivo oxidative damage to DNA after intercalation.\nThe potential use of this DNA film-modified GCE for the understanding of DNA interactions with molecules or ions explores, in a promising way, the use of voltammetric techniques for in situ generation of reactive intermediates and is a complementary tool for the study of biomolecular interaction mechanisms.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

It actively accumulates in the nuclear genome and intercalation occurs predominantly when the double helix has a B-DNA structure, which is the structure into which intercalation occurs.\n\nQ3: What is the known anti-tumor property of Adriamycin?\nA3: Adriamycin has been used in the treatment of various types of cancer for over 30 years. While its mechanism of in vivo action is not yet fully understood, it is known to promote oxidative damage to DNA in cancerous cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species and high levels of 8-oxoguanine, a known biomarker of oxidative stress.\n\nQ4: How does the interaction of Adriamycin with DNA affect the behavior of the drug?\nA4: The interaction of Adriamycin with DNA is known to fundamentally influence the behavior of the drug itself. The positively charged aminosugar in the amino function of Adriamycin interacts with the dsDNA phosphate backbone, aiding in intercalation and binding affinities with dsDNA.\n\nQ5: Can Adriamycin intercalated to double helix DNA react specifically with the guanine moiety? \nA5: Yes, experimental evidence suggests that Adriamycin can react specifically with the guanine moiety of DNA, leading to the formation of mutagenic 8-oxoG.

This invaluable data can help in understanding the mechanism by which DNA is oxidatively damaged by such substances.\n\nQ7: What role does the presence of O2 play in the oxidation of Adriamycin? \nA7: The presence of O2 does not interfere with the oxidation of the 6,11-dihidroquinone functionality of Adriamycin.

When using a thick layer of dsDNA on the GCE, no cleaning of the glassy carbon surface is required as all the Adriamycin is intercalated inside the thick layer of DNA.\n\nQ9: What is the proposed mechanism for the generation of 8-oxoG? \nA9: The generation of 8-oxoG, a main product of guanine oxidation, is proposed to occur through a redox reaction between intercalated Adriamycin and base pairs. The radical cation generated through this reaction is then trapped by water, leading to in situ formation of the oxidative DNA damage product 8-oxoG.\n\nQ10: How does the dsDNA-modified GCE contribute to the understanding of DNA interactions with molecules or ions? \nA10: The use of dsDNA-modified GCE for the in situ sensing of DNA oxidative damage provides valuable insights into how molecules or ions interact with DNA. By enabling the observation of redox reactions between intercalated molecules and base pairs, this modified electrode can help in studying biomolecular interaction mechanisms and how they play out in a charged environment like that found in the living cell.",

        "txt": "The development of an electrochemical DNA-biosensor that can be used to sense in vivo oxidative damage to DNA is of crucial importance. In a health preventing perspective, detection of in vivo oxidative damage to DNA can be very useful for screening and evaluating the effect caused to DNA by carcinogens and oxidising substances in general, for which voltammetric methods are an inexpensive and faster detection procedure. On the other hand, the interpretation of electrochemical data can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism by which DNA is oxidatively damaged by such substances in an approach to the real action scenario that occurs in the living cell .\nInteractions of several substances with double helix DNA have been successfully studied using a recently-developed voltammetric DNA-biosensor . This DNA-biosensor allowed the clarification not only of the specific interaction of some drugs with a certain DNA base but also of the electrochemical mechanism of the interaction .\nAdriamycin, Scheme 1 , is an antibiotic of the family of anthracyclines with a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic applications and anti-neoplasic action but that causes cardiotoxicity that ranges from a delayed and insidious cardiomyopathy to irreversible heart failure . Although, its anti-tumour properties are known for more than 30 years , its mode of in vivo action is not yet fully understood . Efforts for establishing its mechanisms of action are still an important goal to improve its administration and explain anti-cancer activity.\nThere is experimental evidence that adriamycin can promote oxidative damage to DNA in cancerous cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species and high levels of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a known biomarker of oxidative stress, were detected in in vitro studies . The generation of this main product of guanine oxidation within DNA is strongly mutagenic and can contribute to cell disfunction .\nSince 1972 there is ample evidence demonstrated by X-ray crystallography and other methods that adriamycin and analogous anthracycline compounds interact with dsDNA through intercalation and adriamycin actively accumulates in nuclear genome , but less is known as to whether it can directly oxidise dsDNA after intercalation has occurred. In aqueous solution with low salt concentration B-DNA predominates and this is the structure into which intercalation occurs .\nWhen intercalated in double helix DNA, the rings B and C of the adriamycin core, Scheme 1, intercalate between DNA base pairs preferentially, but not in a sequence specific way, at CpG homologous sequences . The aminosugar and the carbonyl side chain linked to ring A remain in the minor groove of the double helix and ring D protrudes into the major groove . The positively charged aminosugar in the amino function interacts with the dsDNA phosphate backbone and is fundamental in intercalation and binding affinities with dsDNA .\nIn this context, the aim of the present paper is concerned with the study of the interaction of adriamycin in situ with dsDNA at a charged interface using a dsDNA-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The possibility that adriamycin intercalated to double helix DNA reacts specifically with the guanine moiety and leads to adriamycin\u2013guanine interaction and formation of the mutagenic 8-oxoG is discussed and a mechanism proposed.\nThe experimental results presented here will give strong evidence that adriamycin can undergo oxidation or reduction after being intercalated into the DNA double helix. Polarographic techniques have been used previously to study the formation of the adriamycin\u2013dsDNA complex in bulk solution . Electrochemical activity for the adriamycin structurally related compound daunomycin intercalated with DNA was also observed using a carbon paste electrode . The results obtained in this work with the dsDNA-modified GCE lead to the conclusion that the electroactive character of the adriamycin\u2013DNA complex depends also on the conformation and orientation of the double helix, parallel or perpendicular, in relation to the electrode surface.\nAdriamycin (Doxorubicin hydrochloride, 2 mg ml\u22121 solution) obtained from Pharma-APS, and sodium salt calf thymus DNA (type II), 8-oxoG, guanine (G), guanosine (Guo) and adenine (A) from Sigma, were used without further purification. Solutions of different concentrations of adriamycin were prepared in pH 4.5 0.1 M acetate buffer electrolyte. All solutions were prepared using analytical grade reagents and purified water from a Millipore Milli-Q system (conductivity <0.1 \u03bcs cm\u22121).\nNitrogen and oxygen saturated solutions were obtained by bubbling high purity N2 or O2 in the solution for 10 min and continuing with a flow of the pure gas over the solution during the voltammetric experiments.\nAll voltammetric experiments were done using an \u03bcAutolab running with GPES version 4.8 software, Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands. A GCE (d=6 mm) working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference, were used in a 5 cm3 one-compartment electrochemical cell. The experimental conditions unless stated otherwise were: cyclic voltammetry, scan rate 2 V s\u22121; differential pulse voltammetry, pulse amplitude 50 mV, pulse width 70 ms, scan rate 5 mV s\u22121. All potentials are referred to SCE.\nMicrovolumes were measured using EP-10 and EP-100 Plus Motorized Microliter Pippettes (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, USA). The pH measurements were carried out with a Crison micropH 2001 pH-meter with an Ingold combined glass electrode. All the experiments were done at room temperature.\nOrigin (version 6.0) from Microcal Software was used for the presentation of all the experimental voltammograms and graphs reported in this work. When necessary, the experimental voltammograms were smoothed using a Savitsky\u2013Golay smoothing algorithm.\nThe antibiotic adriamycin, as mentioned earlier, can be oxidised and reduced at a GCE. The reduction of adriamycin occurs at the 5,12-diquinone groups in the anthracycline chromophore and the oxidation at the 6,11-dihidroquinone-functionality , as shown in the cyclic voltammogram, Fig. 1 , where the concentration and scan rate applied are both very high. Both electron transfer reactions are pH-dependent.\nThe reduction of adriamycin follows a reversible complex mechanism and during reduction a semiquinone radical, which is very reactive with oxygen, is formed. The reduction of the 5,12-diquinone group in adriamycin occurs at potentials of \u22120.40 and \u22120.60 V at pH 4.5, and differential pulse voltammograms show that the I p,a values are dependent on the presence of O2 in solution, Fig. 2 . Reversible behaviour is very clear in the absence of oxygen, after nitrogen is bubbled into the solution for 10 min before scanning. Multi-step electron transfer occurred in a normal atmosphere or in an oxygen-saturated solution, Fig. 2. In this figure, the reduction and oxidation differential pulse voltammograms were background subtracted and offset so that the reduction and subsequent oxidation processes could be compared. The vertical position of the voltammograms has been altered to make comparison easier.\nThe catalytic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), at \u22120.42 V, by adriamycin involves formation of the semiquinone radical intermediate that reduces molecular oxygen to the superoxide radical followed by regeneration of the quinone function moiety, at \u22120.47 V . This homogeneous adriamycin\u2013O2 redox-cycling process increases ROS generation without adriamycin consumption, occurs in vivo and can be detected in situ electrochemically by the significant increase of the reduction, peak at \u22120.42 V, and oxidation, peak at \u22120.49 V, in the differential pulse voltammograms obtained in saturated oxygen solutions, Fig. 2.\nThe presence of O2 does not interfere with the oxidation of the 6,11-dihidroquinone functionality . As expected, the oxidation peak current has not changed, Fig. 3 a, in the differential pulse voltammograms obtained with the same electrode placed in supporting electrolyte saturated with N2 or with O2. This is important because all the oxidation studies and the electrochemical detection of adriamycin interaction with dsDNA are carried out in contact with normal atmosphere.\nThe electrochemical oxidation at a bare GCE of 8-oxoG, guanine, guanosine, adenine, and dsDNA was briefly revisited in order to make it easier to identify the peaks that occur after adriamycin\u2013dsDNA interaction. The differential pulse voltammograms are shown in Fig. 4 . The oxidation peaks for 8-oxoG (E p=+0.45 V), guanine (E p=+0.75 V), guanosine (E p=+0.96 V) and adenine (E p=+1.05 V), show a good separation between most species. However, for guanosine (E p=+0.96 V) and adenine (E p=+1.05 V) there is little difference between the peak potentials and a considerable peak overlap occurs when both are present in the same solution. This means greater difficulty in their identification when the two species exist together. As already described for dsDNA no oxidation peaks were found in the first voltammogram and only after a long adsorption time, the 40th voltammogram, tiny shoulders appeared.\nTo study electrochemically the adriamycin\u2013dsDNA interaction three different modifications of the GCE were used: a thick layer of dsDNA on the GCE, a thin layer of dsDNA on GCE and adriamycin adsorbed onto GCE.\nA thick layer of dsDNA, 100 \u03bcl from a dsDNA concentrated solution (30 mg ml\u22121), was placed on top of a GCE surface, previously polished and electrochemically conditioned in supporting electrolyte, and allowed to dry . This thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was placed in the solution with adriamycin.\nThe oxidation of adriamycin at the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was investigated, Fig. 5 , and the effect of the time of immersion of the modified GCE in 1 \u03bcM adriamycin solution was compared with the results obtained at a bare GCE. In Fig. 3b is shown the voltammogram obtained in buffer for oxidation of 1 \u03bcM adriamycin accumulated onto the bare GCE by chemisorption . With a bare GCE, Fig. 3a, one adriamycin oxidation peak, E p=+0.50 V vs. SCE, with peak width at half height, W 1/2, close to 91 mV, was found by differential pulse voltammetry at pH 4.5. No differences were found for the values of E p and W 1/2 for a 1 \u03bcM adriamycin solution Fig. 5a, when using a thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE. However, it was possible to pre-concentrate adriamycin on the thick layer of DNA and the peak current was found to increase with time and to reach saturation after 1 h of immersion, see insert Fig. 5a and the same occurred with the bare GCE.\nGood reproducibility was observed in the values of differential pulse peak current found for the same period of immersion of the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE in adriamycin solution for the first scan. An abrupt decrease in peak current was always observed in the second scan, Fig. 5b, suggesting a fast consumption of the adriamycin on the surface. This behaviour was found to be reproducible, and a progressive decrease in peak current for the first scan after repeating the 5 min immersion period was also observed. No identifiable peaks due to DNA base oxidation were registered under these voltammetric conditions.\nAs discussed, the reduction of adriamycin follows a reversible complex mechanism and during reduction in an oxygen saturated solution the formation of the semiquinone reactive radical resulting from the adriamycin\u2013O2 cyclic catalytic interaction could be followed, Fig. 2.\nThe thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was used to study electrochemically the changes in the DNA film caused by the adriamycin radical reacting with O2 formed after in situ reduction of adriamycin. In Fig. 6 are differential pulse voltammograms in acetate buffer electrolyte obtained with a bare GCE immersed in an adriamycin solution and with a thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE previously immersed in an adriamycin solution during 10 min, in a normal atmosphere. In the latter case, before introduction in the acetate buffer solution the modified electrode was gently washed with deionised water to assure the removal of adriamycin that was not intercalated in the dsDNA film. In this way, the voltammetric peaks can only result from adriamycin incorporated into the dsDNA thick film without any contribution from diffusion, as they are obtained in supporting electrolyte. In Fig. 6, the same procedure is used as in Fig. 2, the reduction and oxidation differential pulse voltammograms were background subtracted and offset so that the reduction and subsequent oxidation processes could be compared. The vertical position of the voltammograms has been altered to make comparison easier.\nAdriamycin adsorbs irreversibly to the GCE surface and it is always necessary to polish and clean the GCE surface very well. When using the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE it was not necessary to clean the glassy carbon surface after the removal of the dsDNA film. This is a confirmation that all the adriamycin was intercalated inside the thick layer dsDNA film and did not reach the electrode surface. Therefore, the results shown correspond to the signal obtained from adriamycin that was intercalated into the dsDNA thick layer without any contribution from adriamycin in the bulk solution because the experiment was performed only in supporting electrolyte.\nThe differential pulse voltammograms for the reduction of adriamycin at a bare GCE, Fig. 2, showed three consecutive peaks, at \u22120.43, \u22120.53 and \u22120.58 V, whereas at the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE, Fig. 6, only two peaks occur, at \u22120.38 (peak 3) and \u22120.58 V (peak 4), indicating a different mechanism. In the anodic scan, from \u22120.70 to 0.00 V, at the bare GCE there is one very broad peak for the oxidation of adriamycin, peak 1 at \u22120.55 V, whereas at the thick layer DNA-modified GCE, two broad peaks occur, peak 1 at \u22120.60, and a new peak at \u22120.45 V, peak 2, Fig. 6.\nComparing Fig. 6 with the results presented in Fig. 2, the new peak 2 at \u22120.45 V can be attributed to the adriamycin\u2013guanine site interaction in the DNA, resulting in a charge transfer reaction that leads to formation of a guanine radical cation and adriamycin semiquinone, Scheme 2 . In Fig. 6, using the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE, peak 1 occurs at \u22120.60 V, and corresponds to the oxidation of the free adriamycin reduced quinone group, peak 1 at \u22120.55 V in Fig. 2, that is shifted to more negative potential values due to the electrode modification with dsDNA.\nAs mentioned the oxidation peak potential of the 6,11-dihidroquinone-functionality showed no difference when a thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE was used, Fig. 5, and it was even possible to concentrate adriamycin onto the DNA thick layer although no interaction with DNA was observed, independently of the time of immersion.\nHowever, if a potential of \u22120.60 V was applied to the dsDNA-modified electrode during 120 s, big changes occurred inside the DNA layer, Fig. 7 . Two new oxidation peaks appeared, that can be identified : the first at +0.80 V, as guanine oxidation, and the second at +1.05 V, most probably as adenine oxidation, Fig. 4. Nevertheless, the oxidation peak potentials for guanosine and adenine are very close, Fig. 4, and this makes their identification difficult. As adriamycin intercalates between DNA base pairs preferentially at CpG homologous sequences is understandable that peaks for guanine and guanosine will occur. However, it is also possible that adenine molecules in the unfolded strand reach the electrode. The broad peak observed probably includes a contribution from both guanosine and adenine, but it is not possible to obtain two separate peaks.\nAdriamycin can undergo a reaction beginning with the transfer of a single electron to the quinone portion of the adriamycin ring system, generating a free radical . A mechanism of guanine oxidation, after adriamycin intercalation within double helix DNA , by the very reactive adriamycin radical formed at \u22120.60 V is proposed in Scheme 2 and is in agreement with results obtained by other methods . Besides these two new peaks, the oxidation peak of adriamycin became broader, the peak width at half height, W 1/2, being greater than that obtained for adriamycin, and appeared at E p=+0.45 V, a peak potential 50 mV less positive than for adriamycin alone, shifted towards the potential for 8-oxoG oxidation, Fig. 4 . Following Scheme 2, this peak can be related with the interaction between adriamycin and 8-oxoG formed after adriamycin intercalation in DNA in guanine-rich regions .\nA thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE was prepared by immersing the GCE in a 60 \u03bcg ml\u22121 dsDNA solution at +0.40 V applied potential during 10 min, a similar procedure as has been used with ssDNA on carbon paste electrodes . In this electrode modification a non-uniform thin layer of dsDNA is adsorbed onto the GCE leaving many bare glassy carbon uncovered regions. This thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE was immersed during 3 min in an adriamycin solution, rinsed with water, and afterwards transferred to buffer, where differential pulse voltammetry was performed. Results in acetate buffer, Fig. 8 , showed different features. Without applying a negative potential only the peak for adriamycin oxidation at +0.50 V occurs. After applying the potential of \u22120.60 V during 60 s, the oxidation peak for guanine, at +0.84 V, and the oxidation peak for 8-oxoG in the unfolded strand, at +0.38 V, also appeared.\nThese results are in agreement with those with the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE. The clear separation of the adriamycin and 8-oxoG peaks can be explained by the non-uniform coverage of the electrode surface by DNA and adsorption of adriamycin on the uncovered glassy carbon. This is very important as it enables the use of the less positive peak of oxidation of 8-oxoG to detect DNA damage, which can only be achieved with the thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE.\nHowever, it is not possible to detect the adriamycin\u2013DNA damage by monitoring only changes in the adriamycin oxidation peak. The damage to immobilised dsDNA causes the appearance of oxidation peaks from DNA bases and this should always be measured and taken into account. In fact, this is the drawback of the thin layer dsDNA-modified GCE since it leads to two contributions from simple adsorbed analyte and damage to immobilised DNA which needs to be carefully distinguished.\nIt is interesting to take advantage of adriamycin's strong and irreversible adsorption on the glassy carbon surface. In Fig. 3b, the voltammogram in buffer shows the accumulation of adriamycin onto a bare GCE. An adriamycin adsorbed-modified GCE could be prepared by immersing the electrode in an adriamycin solution for a short period of time with or without deposition potential applied. To prepare the adriamycin adsorbed-modified GCE used here the GCE was immersed in a 5 \u03bcM adriamycin solution for 10 min at a deposition potential of +0.40 V, and was then always rinsed thoroughly with water before transferring to the DNA solution where the voltammetric measurements were done. As before, the reduction of the chemisorbed adriamycin was always investigated and the voltammograms were obtained in buffer solution without adriamycin in solution so as to have no contribution from bulk analyte diffusion. The effect of the presence of O2 (supporting electrolyte saturated with O2) and absence (supporting electrolyte saturated with N2) on the voltammetric behaviour of the adsorbed layer of adriamycin was also investigated. The results confirmed the strong dependence of the reduction reaction of adsorbed adriamycin on the presence of oxygen, and no influence on the oxidation, described earlier with adriamycin in solution, Figs. 2 and 3a, respectively.\nAt the adriamycin adsorbed-modified GCE, adriamycin was confined to the electrode surface and the total surface concentration of adriamycin was calculated using, \u0393adr=4RTIp,a/n2F2A\u03bd, to be \u0393 adr=2.57\u00d710\u221210 mol cm\u22122 .\nThe interaction with DNA in solution was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry, Fig. 9 . The first scan shows a big peak corresponding to the oxidation of the adsorbed adriamycin and other peaks attributed to DNA purine bases oxidation can also be seen. This is indicative that even adriamycin chemisorbed to the electrode surface intercalates with DNA that diffuses from solution, causing distortion of the double strand and allowing the oxidation of the purine bases.\nA subsequent differential pulse voltammogram obtained after application of 0.00 V for 60 s shows a drastic decrease in the adriamycin oxidation peak, Fig. 9, besides the peaks already mentioned for the oxidation of the purine bases. This decrease in the adriamycin oxidation peak is explained easily because the only adriamycin existing on the electrode surface has reacted intercalating with DNA, so the 6,11-dihydroquinone functionality is not available any more to react at the electrode surface.\nHowever, if after the first scan a potential of \u22120.60 V is applied during 60 s, a broad peak, at +0.40 V, appears, Fig. 9. This peak can be identified, as in Fig. 7, with the interaction between adriamycin and 8-oxoG formed after adriamycin intercalation in DNA in guanine-rich regions , in agreement with the proposed mechanism, Scheme 2.\nThe adriamycin reduction clearly conditions the adriamycin\u2013dsDNA interaction and this was shown using the three different modifications of the GCE: a thick layer of dsDNA onto GCE, a thin layer of dsDNA onto GCE and adriamycin adsorbed onto GCE.\nAdriamycin reduction occurs inside the dsDNA thick layer and the radical formed can interact with DNA in situ and the products be retained in the DNA layer. The reaction of O2 with adriamycin at the electrode surface should also be considered. It is not expected that the concentration of O2 in the thick layer dsDNA-modified GCE is sufficiently large to explain the similar peak split observed in O2-saturated solutions. Therefore, this must be explained by considering that the reduced adriamycin reactive radical interacts with nucleotides of the DNA in which it is intercalated in a similar fashion to the adriamycin\u2013O2 mechanism which occurs in O2-saturated solutions. Thus, this reduced adriamycin radical interaction with DNA is responsible for the changes in DNA, always detected after the conditioning potential of \u22120.60 V was applied. In fact, the thick-layer dsDNA-modified GCE is a multi-layer film of DNA gel covering the glassy carbon surface completely and uniformly with no pinholes or GCE uncovered regions. Since the experiments were carried out in buffer, the peaks recorded for the reduction or oxidation of adriamycin can only be attributed to the reaction of adriamycin molecules that are inside the thick film of dsDNA.\nThe results presented here give experimental electrochemical evidence that adriamycin intercalates in double helix DNA and can oxidatively damage DNA, leading to the generation of 8-oxoG. Electrochemical in situ generation of adriamycin semiquinone radical at \u22120.60 V permits a detailed study of this interaction mechanism. In Scheme 2 is shown the proposed mechanism for the generation of 8-oxoG when a negative conditioning potential is applied, by intercalation of adriamycin into the double helix DNA.\nIn the configuration of Scheme 2 both adriamycin electroactive functional groups (the oxidisable hydroquinone group in ring B, and the reducible quinone function in ring C) are intercalated between the base pairs in the DNA\u2013adriamycin complex in close interaction with the GC base pair. The reducible quinone group in ring C protrudes slightly into the major groove, and this enables in situ (in helix) generation of an adriamycin radical within the double helix. Therefore, a redox reaction between adriamycin and guanine residues inside the double helix of DNA can be considered, in order to explain the experimental data.\n8-Oxoguanine is the main product of guanine oxidation, but the mechanistic pathway involving two electrons and two protons depends on the chemical environment surrounding guanine. Contrary to the oxidation of free guanine in solution, in the biopolymer, deprotonation of the guanine radical cation is partially prevented by base-stacking interactions with cytosine, and the hydrolysis reaction is most favourable to occur in double helix DNA .\nThe formation of adriamycin\u2013DNA adducts has been reported and the hypothesis that their formation involves redox reactions between intercalated adriamycin and base pairs must be taken into account in the light of the present results. In fact, the transitory generation of the guanine cation radical close to the adriamycin semiquinone radical cation may result in an adriamycin-base adduct formation that competes with the hydrolysis step. The intercalation may cause sufficient distortion of the dsDNA to expose the radical cation to hydrolysis. This would lead to the transient formation of a 8-hydroxy-7,8-dihydropurin-7-yl radical, the likely precursor of 8-oxoG inside the double helix .\nWhen a potential of \u22120.6 V is applied, adriamycin is reduced and this redox process occurs within the DNA double helix and involves the simultaneous oxidation of one neighbouring guanine residue. In this way, electron transfer from the guanine moiety to the quinone without hydrogen abstraction is likely to be the predominant reaction leading to the formation of the guanine cation. Due to the fast hydrolysis of the radical cation, the semiquinone undergoes further reduction to the fully reduced adriamycin and the formation of 8-oxoG occurs, instead of being reoxidised, as would happen in O2-saturated solution. So the hydrolysis step is followed by a second electron transfer and leads to the ultimate formation of 8-oxoG and reduced adriamycin.\nFinally, the \u03c0-stacked base pairs characteristic of double helix DNA might serve as a pathway for charge transport mediating the redox reaction between adriamycin radicals, generated during reduction, and guanine residues in the double helix. The trapping by water of the generated radical cation leads to in situ formation of the oxidative DNA damage product 8-oxoG. Further oxidation of 8-oxoG could lead to hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond generating an abasic site . This could disrupt the double helix causing strand break, exposing 8-oxoG residues and other purines to the electrode surface that can then be oxidised.\nElectrochemical voltammetric in situ sensing of DNA oxidative damage caused by reduced adriamycin intercalated into DNA was possible using the dsDNA film-modified GCE. The results indicate that adriamycin intercalated in double helix DNA can undergo oxidation or reduction and reacts specifically with the guanine moiety, and thence to the formation of mutagenic 8-oxoG residues. A model for this electrochemically observed in situ oxidative damage was proposed and may be used to explain the levels of 8-oxoG found when cells are treated with adriamycin as well as its well-known free radical activity.\nThis is very relevant because the mechanism of interaction of DNA\u2013adriamycin at charged interfaces mimics better the in vivo DNA\u2013adriamycin complex situation, where it is expected that DNA is in close contact with charged phospholipid membranes and proteins, rather than when the interaction is in solution. The results presented contribute with a possible mechanism through which adriamycin can cause direct in vivo oxidative damage to DNA after intercalation.\nThe potential use of this DNA film-modified GCE for the understanding of DNA interactions with molecules or ions explores, in a promising way, the use of voltammetric techniques for in situ generation of reactive intermediates and is a complementary tool for the study of biomolecular interaction mechanisms."

An ideal chromatographic experiment leads to perfect separation of these chemical analytes. The resolving power can be increased when mass spectrometry (MS) is coupled to GC, since the MS dimension provides additional resolving power compared to traditional detectors such as the flame ionization detector (FID) . The high sensitivity, the low limit of detection, the possibility of analyzing a great number of analytes and identifying these using the mass spectra, makes GC-MS one of the most widespread analytical techniques in many scientific fields. Several excellent reviews have recently been published showing the possibilities and the limitations of GC-MS in biological matrices , geological and forensic research , environmental matrices , proteomics and metabonomics .\nHowever, analysis of GC-MS data is sometimes hampered by different problems, mainly derived from the chromatographic separation and/or MS measurements. Sometimes, it is impossible to achieve perfect separation, because the samples are complex or faster chromatographic runs are preferred. Also, problems with baseline drift, changes in the shapes of peaks and shifts in elution times may decrease the quality of the final result of the analysis . Traditionally, the use of, for example, one or more standards help to control and to locate some of these problems. However, the capability of internal standards is limited in more severe cases of baseline drift and changes in the shapes of peaks.\nDue to the complexity of the samples often measured using GC-MS, standard data-analysis tools from instrument vendors are insufficient for extracting all the relevant information from such data. A more versatile methodology is needed for the analysis of the datasets to provide results that can be plotted in an easy, comprehensive way.\nSeveral mathematical methods have already been proposed to correct for undesirable phenomena introduced during the chromatographic run . Unfortunately, the use of advanced data analysis focusing on detailed analysis of GC-MS data is not widespread. For example, the Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) algorithm has shown promise in handling elution-time shifting due to its peak shape and area-preserving properties . Skov et al. put forward an interesting approach for how to choose the best conditions for applying the COW algorithm in correcting elution-time shifts while preserving peak shapes However, COW does not allow correcting artifacts (e.g., varying baseline or severe overlapping peaks) and can introduce artifacts if peak-shape changes are observed across samples.\nWhen a GC-MS measurement is performed, a two-way matrix is obtained for each sample (Fig. 1 a). The matrix corresponding to the kth sample, X k, is of dimensions I \u00d7 J, where the columns represent each of the length, I, mass spectra for each of the J elution times (rows). A three-way structure is obtained when measurements from a set of samples are obtained and stacked (Fig. 1b). The cube of data will be X(I \u00d7 J \u00d7 K).\nIn the past 10 years, there has been increased focus on taking advantage of this three-way structure of GC-MS data, or of any other hyphenated chromatographic techniques (e.g., LC-MS or HPLC-UV). This has been made possible by the improvement in data acquisition and the power of personal computers. Models used include Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares in the unfolded way (MCR-ALS) , Generalized Rank Annihilation Method (GRAM) and PARAllel FACtor analysis (PARAFAC) .\nThe first general solution for handling the overlapping-peaks problem was GRAM by S\u00e1nchez and co-workers . This method was a generalization of the method Rank Annihilation Factor Analysis (RAFA) of Ho and co-workers , mainly used for quantification. The main feature of GRAM is that it works even with only two samples. The first sample usually holds the chromatographic profile of a mixture containing known standard(s) and the second contains the analytes whose profiles overlap.\nRAFA and GRAM have the serious drawback that they can be used only in cases of a single standard and a single unknown mixture. Hence, the results rely heavily on the quality of the two samples, and no additional benefits can be gained from having more samples. To overcome this problem, S\u00e1nchez and co-workers developed the Direct Trilinear Decomposition (DTLD) algorithm , which is an extension of GRAM for more than two samples. DTLD decomposes the data into three matrices, containing the elution profiles, the mass spectra and quantitative information about each of the components in each sample. Both GRAM and DTLD are efficient when the data are well approximated by the underlying model, but they are often too sensitive to minor deviations (e.g., caused by retention-time shifts).\nThe PARAFAC model is probably the most widespread multi-way method in chromatography. PARAFAC decomposes the three-way array into three matrices, called loading matrices, one for each mode. For the sample mode, the loading matrix is usually referred to as a score matrix and holds the relative concentration of each chemical compound in the sample if the model successfully separates the individual chemical compounds into individual PARAFAC factors. The elution-mode loading matrix correspondingly holds the estimated elution profiles of each analyte and the last mode, the estimated mass spectra of each factor.\nThe major problem with GRAM, DTLD and PARAFAC relates to the intrinsic structure of the data array that these models can handle. The models all assume that the elution profiles and the mass spectra remain invariant (i.e. same profile) for all the samples (i.e. the data set is low-rank trilinear and that data from each analyte have a rank-one contribution to the data) . In an ideal situation, this assumption will be valid. Nevertheless, this assumption is often far from reality due to different sources of variability in the elution-time mode of GC-MS data. Consequently, trilinearity of the data is disturbed, especially due to changes in the elution-time mode (Table 1 ).\nOne method that allows a certain freedom in chromatographic profiles is the MCR-ALS . Here, analysis is performed by unfolding the three-way array in the chromatographic direction, while keeping the MS dimension intact. The main advantage of MCR-ALS is that it can also handle non-trilinear data. Nevertheless, MCR-ALS greatly depends on the initial estimates of input parameters (elution and MS profiles) and the three-way information is lost in the unfolding stage. This implies that it is impossible to recover estimates of the signal from the underlying analytes unless certain requirements are fulfilled.\nLike PARAFAC, PARAFAC2 also decomposes three-way data arrays into loading matrices, but the main difference is that PARAFAC2 does not impose such strong restrictions on the data structure . PARAFAC2 does not assume that the shape (or even length) of the elution profile of an analyte is the same in each sample (Table 1). This property has allowed the use of the PARAFAC2 model in such diverse fields as sensor-based data , semiconductor production , HPLC-DAD , kinetic spectrophotometric analysis , modeling of flavor release and analytical dilution systems . Even though PARAFAC2 allows elution profiles to differ in shape in different samples, it still possesses uniqueness properties that are very similar to those of PARAFAC . This means that, if a successful model is obtained, PARAFAC2 can separate mixture data into the contributions (concentrations, elution profiles and mass spectra) of the underlying analytes directly. PARAFAC2 could be an ideal technique for modeling GC-MS data, as the model allows one elution-time profile to be obtained for each factor of the sample, taking into consideration that each analyte has a mass spectrum that is consistent across all samples. Excellent examples of the use of PARAFAC2 in GC-MS can be found. For example, in the work of Cruz et al., calibration models were developed with PARAFAC2 for the quantification of five hormonal growth promoters and of several steroidal hormones , and similar results obtained compared to an internal-standard calibration in terms of figures of merits. Also, in the work of Hibbert et al. , PARAFAC2 was applied to classify different weathered oils. Nevertheless, as Skov et al. stated, further investigations are needed to establish fully the usefulness of PARAFAC2 in modeling GC-MS data.\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of several problems in GC-MS (e.g., severe shifts in retention time, overlapping peaks, baseline drift and low-intensity peaks) and how PARAFAC2 can handle these. The article also highlights possible limitations in using PARAFAC2.\nThree-way chromatographic data can be arranged in such a way that the first mode refers to mass channels, the second mode to elution times and the third mode to samples (Fig. 1b).\nThe PARAFAC2 model allows that every sample can have its own distinct set of elution-time loadings . Each sample (each slab of X) X k(I \u00d7 J) is modeled as indicated in Equation (1) (Fig. 2 ). Xk=ADk(Bk)T+Ek;k=1,..,K where X k(I \u00d7 J) represents the chromatographic run related to the kth sample. A (I \u00d7 F) holds the resolved mass spectra of the F analytes. D k (F\u00d7F) is a diagonal matrix that holds the kth row of the sample-mode loading matrix C. Each element in this row is the relative concentration of analyte f. Matrix B k(I\u00d7F) ideally holds an estimate of the individual elution profiles for each of the F factors. Matrix E k represents the residuals.\nAn important constraint in PARAFAC2 is that the cross-product of B k has to be constant over all the samples (Equation (2)). This constraint is needed to obtain uniqueness. The implication of this cross-product constraint is that the elution profiles in different experiments may differ (e.g., due to shifting), but should still be somewhat similar. (B1)T(B1)=(B2)T(B2)=\u2026=(Bk)T(Bk) Fig. 2 illustrates the decomposition of the three-way array X. Detailed information about the model and algorithms is available .\nThe data used here comprise GC-MS landscapes of 24 samples of red wines of different origin (Fig. 3 ) . A dynamic headspace-GC-MS (HS-GC-MS) system was used to measure the aroma profile of the wine samples. More information about the collection and the experimental set-up of the samples is available .\nTypical GC-MS problems are reflected in the data (e.g., severe changes in the shape of several peaks, severe shift in elution time, low intensity of peaks, baseline drift and overlapping peaks). Five areas of the data set were selected to reflect these problems (highlighted in solid squares in Fig. 3).\nCurrently, software for computing PARAFAC2 models is available from two sources. The first can be freely downloaded from the Internet . The second can be obtained from Eigenvector Research and is implemented in PLS_Toolbox v. 4.1 . Both algorithms work in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc. 2008). For this article, we used PARAFAC2 from PLS_Toolbox v. 4.1.\nFrom an analytical point of view, the estimated mass spectra as well as their corresponding concentrations cannot be negative, so non-negativity constraints were imposed for sample and MS loadings. In the PARAFAC2 algorithm available and used in this work , it is impossible to impose non-negativity constraints on the elution profiles, even though this would also be appropriate.\nThe selection of the correct number of factors is the most important aspect of the model in applying PARAFAC2. Because of the nature of the model, all parameter estimates (e.g., estimated elution profiles) depend on each other, so the correct number of factors must be used. Otherwise, the parameters will, at worst, be chemically meaningless, even though they are uniquely determined mathematically. In this article and in chromatographic analysis in general, it is advisable to resolve chromatographic peaks individually, hence to work on a small window or region of the elution-time dimension. That way, the quality of the models will be better, because indirect and direct correlations between different compounds do not affect the modeling and because the problem of choosing the number of factors is typically simplified significantly.\nIn the following, the number of factors was determined by assessing the explained variance for the model (Equation (3)) as well as scrutinizing the appearance of the parameters and the residuals. The explained variance was calculated as follows: %var=100\u00d71-SSESSX where SSE is the sum of the squares of the residuals and SSX is the sum of the squares of the elements of the three-way array. Furthermore, visual interpretation of the results (such as residuals) was used to guide the selection.\nAll the MS loadings obtained were scaled in order to compare with experimental mass spectra. The experimental mass spectra were obtained from a run of the pure analyte, if this was identified from the chromatographic software. Otherwise, we used an average of all mass spectra from all scans constituting an individual peak. We made the comparison by calculating the similarity between the experimental mass spectrum and the calculated loading. This was calculated as follows: fit(%)=100\u00d71-\u2211xi-xi\u23222\u2211xi2 where xi corresponds to the intensity for m/z equal to i for the experimental spectrum and xi\u2322 corresponds to the appropriate loading. The Wiley Library for identification of analytes in ChemStation was used to identify the structure of each analyte according to the experimental mass spectrum and the MS loading obtained with PARAFAC2.\nThe peaks in region \u201ca\u201d of the chromatogram (Fig. 3a) represent the classical problem of shifts in elution time. This is a well-defined peak, with high intensity (high signal-to-noise ratio). The peak of one sample is severely shifted but all the remaining ones are also shifted.\nFig. 4 shows results obtained with PARAFAC2. In this situation, it is easy to see that the PARAFAC2 model has to be developed with only one factor. As expected, PARAFAC2 is able to model the chromatogram of the peak for each sample (Fig. 4a).\nFig. 4b shows the relative concentration loading obtained for each sample. This concentration-loading value is an estimate of the area under each chromatographic peak. It can be used for calibration models for the analyte of interest. The mass spectrum obtained with PARAFAC2 perfectly matches the one obtained experimentally. The similarity is 99.9%.\nFig. 4c compares the mass spectrum obtained with PARAFAC2 (upper) and the real mass spectra (bottom). This peak was identified as acetic-acid ethyl ester .\nThe second region selected appears between scan 2635 and 2695. Looking at the enlargement in the inset (Fig. 3b), it is difficult to assess the number of analytes present because of the overlaps, shifts and baseline drift.\nAt first, there seems to be only two slightly overlapping peaks. The explained variance of a PARAFAC2 model with two factors is 97.25%, which is on the low side for data such as these (Table 2 ). The residuals of this model trends present that may indicate that two factors are not enough to explain the systematic variation in the data, probably due to a baseline effect reflected in the background mass spectrum. A PARAFAC2 model with three factors explains more than 99%. Fig. 5 a and b show the chromatographic loadings and the relative concentrations for factor 1 (solid), factor 2 (dashed) and, what is more important, for the background (dotted).\nThe two chemical analytes have been identified as acetic acid-hexyl ester (Fig. 5c) and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (Fig. 5d), respectively. The background signal is most probably due to column bleeding, so it has a specific and consistent mass spectrum within the narrow elution-time window investigated and from this can be described in one PARAFAC2 factor (Fig. 5e). The chromatographic loadings are perfectly defined for each sample, handling the problems of shifts within elution-time profiles and across the samples, overlapping of peaks and baseline drift. The elution-time loading for the background (Fig. 5a) shows how the influence of the background remains almost constant throughout the different samples.\nThe similarity between the background mass spectrum obtained with PARAFAC2 and the mass spectrum obtained experimentally (electron-impact (EI) mass spectrum obtained from ) is more than 99.8%. The similarities for factor 1 and factor 2 mass spectra are 95.5% and 98.9%, respectively.\nWe need to point out that the shape of the chromatographic loading for one sample (red, Fig. 5a) does not have a very well-defined shape. This is merely an artifact due to the way the elution profiles are presented. As can be seen in the concentration mode (red circle, Fig. 5b), the concentration is approximately zero in the sample, so the (normalized) elution profile is not well defined.\nThe next two examples are devoted to showing how PARAFAC2 can help to obtain the mass spectrum of an analyte whose signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Qualitative as well as quantitative analysis is then difficult, because the mass spectrum of the analyte is greatly affected by the background mass spectrum. The elution-time regions between 4340 and 4390 scans (Fig. 3c) and 5500 and 5700 scans (Fig. 3d) reflect problems encountered with low-intensity peaks. Such areas are often not studied because of the low quality of the signal and the high interference of the baseline drift.\nThe first case (Fig. 3c) again reflects the situation where some analytes are absent in some samples, and the peak is greatly affected by the background interference, and that causes low signal-to-noise ratios. As can be expected, PARAFAC2 allows modeling of the chromatographic profile even if there is no analyte (Table 2, Fig. 6 a). The estimated mass spectrum obtained for factor 1 identifies the peak as ethyl dec-9-enoate (Fig. 6c), and the chromatographic loading reflects that there are two samples with a concentration of the analyte close to zero (Fig. 6a and b). Once again, the similarity between mass spectrum obtained for background and the experimental one is above 99.5%.\nIn the second case (Fig. 3d), the peak of the analyte, which is perfectly separated from the background using two factors, is obtained using PARAFAC2 (Fig. 7 a and b). In this case, the chromatographic peak was identified as a common contaminant in GC-MS analysis, bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (Fig. 7c). The mass spectrum obtained for the background perfectly matches the experimental one (similarity above 99.5%).\nAs shown above, PARAFAC2 has a remarkable ability to extract chemical information even in cases of low-intensity signals. Nevertheless, we also need to mention and study situations where the model cannot handle the chromatographic data.\nApart from the time for model calculation (that can be minutes to hours on current state-of-the-art personal computers), the main problem of PARAFAC2 is the need to determine the correct number of factors.\nAn example of the difficulty in determining the number of factors can be found in the area between scans 2100 and 2500 (Fig. 3e). Apparently, there are two peaks in this elution-time interval, so a PARAFAC2 model with two factors would be expected to model both peaks (maybe three if baseline is modeled as well). Nevertheless, the chromatographic loadings obtained for the model with two factors are very different from those expected (results not shown). The first factor involves both peaks, whereas the second factor seems to be an artifact of the mathematical model. This result may indicate an incorrect number of factors were chosen, and both peaks may belong to the same analyte, but in isomeric forms. Nevertheless, these peaks were identified as isoamyl alcohol and hexanoic acid ethyl ester, respectively. The mass spectra of these analytes are indeed different.\nFurther analysis of the raw data between 2250 and 2350 scans indicated that the mass spectrum obtained at scan 2306 (Fig. 8 a) and scan 2325 (Fig. 8b) for sample 1 (as an example) differ in shape. Ideally, all the mass channels have to increase in intensity in the second scan with respect to the first. Nevertheless, there are several mass channels that decrease in intensity (e.g., channels m/z 53 and 54). This may be caused by a perfect co-elution problem of several analytes at low concentration. As mentioned above, the peak was identified as isoamylic alcohol (3-methyl-butanol). It is well known that isomeric forms of methyl-butanol can co-elute .\nA PARAFAC2 model with two and three factors was fitted to the first peak, obtaining models that explained 99.5% and more than 99.9% of the total variance, respectively (Fig. 9 , Table 2). The model with two factors seems to indicate that, effectively, the co-elution of, at least, two isomeric forms of methyl-butanol occurs (Fig. 9a). The dashed peak was identified as isoamylic alcohol (3-methyl-butanol); whereas the dotted peak was identified as 2-methyl-butanol.\nDespite the apparent success of the model, several problems still remain (red-marked samples). The elution profiles obtained for the PARAFAC2 model with three factors (Fig. 9b) allow clear identification of 3-methyl-butanol (dotted) and 2-methyl-butanol (dashed), having a very well-defined shape. Furthermore, a third factor has been modeled (solid). The profile of its mass spectrum is highly correlated with the mass spectrum of 3-methyl-butanol. This may indicate that, apart from the co-elution problem, other variability sources exist in the raw dataset that do not allow a fully satisfactory PARAFAC2 model to be obtained.\nWe have demonstrated that PARAFAC2 is a powerful tool for solving problems derived from experimental variability in GC-MS data. The variance explained in all models was above 99%. The mass spectra obtained matched the real mass spectra, even for the background and for analytes of very low intensity, and even where standard chromatographic software would not have been able to provide meaningful results.\nPARAFAC2 handled problems, such as baseline drifts, differently shaped peaks, overlapping peaks or even low signal-to-noise ratios. This capability and the uniqueness property of the mass spectra allow PARAFAC2 to resolve low-intensity peaks so that MS loadings can be used for qualitative purposes (identification) and that the relative concentration obtained can be used for quantitative determination of the analytes.\nThe technique that we have presented can also be used for other hyphenated separation techniques (e.g., HPLC-UV and LC-MS), where peak shift, peak-shape changes and baseline contributions are often even bigger issues.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Gas chromatography (GC) is a very powerful separation technique for multifactor mixtures of analytes. An ideal chromatographic experiment leads to perfect separation of these chemical analytes. The resolving power can be increased when mass spectrometry (MS) is coupled to GC, since the MS dimension provides additional resolving power compared to traditional detectors such as the flame ionization detector (FID) . The high sensitivity, the low limit of detection, the possibility of analyzing a great number of analytes and identifying these using the mass spectra, makes GC-MS one of the most widespread analytical techniques in many scientific fields. Several excellent reviews have recently been published showing the possibilities and the limitations of GC-MS in biological matrices , geological and forensic research , environmental matrices , proteomics and metabonomics .\nHowever, analysis of GC-MS data is sometimes hampered by different problems, mainly derived from the chromatographic separation and/or MS measurements. Sometimes, it is impossible to achieve perfect separation, because the samples are complex or faster chromatographic runs are preferred. Also, problems with baseline drift, changes in the shapes of peaks and shifts in elution times may decrease the quality of the final result of the analysis . Traditionally, the use of, for example, one or more standards help to control and to locate some of these problems. However, the capability of internal standards is limited in more severe cases of baseline drift and changes in the shapes of peaks.\nDue to the complexity of the samples often measured using GC-MS, standard data-analysis tools from instrument vendors are insufficient for extracting all the relevant information from such data. A more versatile methodology is needed for the analysis of the datasets to provide results that can be plotted in an easy, comprehensive way.\nSeveral mathematical methods have already been proposed to correct for undesirable phenomena introduced during the chromatographic run . Unfortunately, the use of advanced data analysis focusing on detailed analysis of GC-MS data is not widespread. For example, the Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) algorithm has shown promise in handling elution-time shifting due to its peak shape and area-preserving properties . Skov et al. put forward an interesting approach for how to choose the best conditions for applying the COW algorithm in correcting elution-time shifts while preserving peak shapes However, COW does not allow correcting artifacts (e.g., varying baseline or severe overlapping peaks) and can introduce artifacts if peak-shape changes are observed across samples.\nWhen a GC-MS measurement is performed, a two-way matrix is obtained for each sample (Fig. 1 a). The matrix corresponding to the kth sample, X k, is of dimensions I \u00d7 J, where the columns represent each of the length, I, mass spectra for each of the J elution times (rows). A three-way structure is obtained when measurements from a set of samples are obtained and stacked (Fig. 1b). The cube of data will be X(I \u00d7 J \u00d7 K).\nIn the past 10 years, there has been increased focus on taking advantage of this three-way structure of GC-MS data, or of any other hyphenated chromatographic techniques (e.g., LC-MS or HPLC-UV). This has been made possible by the improvement in data acquisition and the power of personal computers. Models used include Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares in the unfolded way (MCR-ALS) , Generalized Rank Annihilation Method (GRAM) and PARAllel FACtor analysis (PARAFAC) .\nThe first general solution for handling the overlapping-peaks problem was GRAM by S\u00e1nchez and co-workers . This method was a generalization of the method Rank Annihilation Factor Analysis (RAFA) of Ho and co-workers , mainly used for quantification. The main feature of GRAM is that it works even with only two samples. The first sample usually holds the chromatographic profile of a mixture containing known standard(s) and the second contains the analytes whose profiles overlap.\nRAFA and GRAM have the serious drawback that they can be used only in cases of a single standard and a single unknown mixture. Hence, the results rely heavily on the quality of the two samples, and no additional benefits can be gained from having more samples. To overcome this problem, S\u00e1nchez and co-workers developed the Direct Trilinear Decomposition (DTLD) algorithm , which is an extension of GRAM for more than two samples. DTLD decomposes the data into three matrices, containing the elution profiles, the mass spectra and quantitative information about each of the components in each sample. Both GRAM and DTLD are efficient when the data are well approximated by the underlying model, but they are often too sensitive to minor deviations (e.g., caused by retention-time shifts).\nThe PARAFAC model is probably the most widespread multi-way method in chromatography. PARAFAC decomposes the three-way array into three matrices, called loading matrices, one for each mode. For the sample mode, the loading matrix is usually referred to as a score matrix and holds the relative concentration of each chemical compound in the sample if the model successfully separates the individual chemical compounds into individual PARAFAC factors. The elution-mode loading matrix correspondingly holds the estimated elution profiles of each analyte and the last mode, the estimated mass spectra of each factor.\nThe major problem with GRAM, DTLD and PARAFAC relates to the intrinsic structure of the data array that these models can handle. The models all assume that the elution profiles and the mass spectra remain invariant (i.e. same profile) for all the samples (i.e. the data set is low-rank trilinear and that data from each analyte have a rank-one contribution to the data) . In an ideal situation, this assumption will be valid. Nevertheless, this assumption is often far from reality due to different sources of variability in the elution-time mode of GC-MS data. Consequently, trilinearity of the data is disturbed, especially due to changes in the elution-time mode (Table 1 ).\nOne method that allows a certain freedom in chromatographic profiles is the MCR-ALS . Here, analysis is performed by unfolding the three-way array in the chromatographic direction, while keeping the MS dimension intact. The main advantage of MCR-ALS is that it can also handle non-trilinear data. Nevertheless, MCR-ALS greatly depends on the initial estimates of input parameters (elution and MS profiles) and the three-way information is lost in the unfolding stage. This implies that it is impossible to recover estimates of the signal from the underlying analytes unless certain requirements are fulfilled.\nLike PARAFAC, PARAFAC2 also decomposes three-way data arrays into loading matrices, but the main difference is that PARAFAC2 does not impose such strong restrictions on the data structure . PARAFAC2 does not assume that the shape (or even length) of the elution profile of an analyte is the same in each sample (Table 1). This property has allowed the use of the PARAFAC2 model in such diverse fields as sensor-based data , semiconductor production , HPLC-DAD , kinetic spectrophotometric analysis , modeling of flavor release and analytical dilution systems . Even though PARAFAC2 allows elution profiles to differ in shape in different samples, it still possesses uniqueness properties that are very similar to those of PARAFAC . This means that, if a successful model is obtained, PARAFAC2 can separate mixture data into the contributions (concentrations, elution profiles and mass spectra) of the underlying analytes directly. PARAFAC2 could be an ideal technique for modeling GC-MS data, as the model allows one elution-time profile to be obtained for each factor of the sample, taking into consideration that each analyte has a mass spectrum that is consistent across all samples. Excellent examples of the use of PARAFAC2 in GC-MS can be found. For example, in the work of Cruz et al., calibration models were developed with PARAFAC2 for the quantification of five hormonal growth promoters and of several steroidal hormones , and similar results obtained compared to an internal-standard calibration in terms of figures of merits. Also, in the work of Hibbert et al. , PARAFAC2 was applied to classify different weathered oils. Nevertheless, as Skov et al. stated, further investigations are needed to establish fully the usefulness of PARAFAC2 in modeling GC-MS data.\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of several problems in GC-MS (e.g., severe shifts in retention time, overlapping peaks, baseline drift and low-intensity peaks) and how PARAFAC2 can handle these. The article also highlights possible limitations in using PARAFAC2.\nThree-way chromatographic data can be arranged in such a way that the first mode refers to mass channels, the second mode to elution times and the third mode to samples (Fig. 1b).\nThe PARAFAC2 model allows that every sample can have its own distinct set of elution-time loadings . Each sample (each slab of X) X k(I \u00d7 J) is modeled as indicated in Equation (1) (Fig. 2 ). Xk=ADk(Bk)T+Ek;k=1,..,K where X k(I \u00d7 J) represents the chromatographic run related to the kth sample. A (I \u00d7 F) holds the resolved mass spectra of the F analytes. D k (F\u00d7F) is a diagonal matrix that holds the kth row of the sample-mode loading matrix C. Each element in this row is the relative concentration of analyte f. Matrix B k(I\u00d7F) ideally holds an estimate of the individual elution profiles for each of the F factors. Matrix E k represents the residuals.\nAn important constraint in PARAFAC2 is that the cross-product of B k has to be constant over all the samples (Equation (2)). This constraint is needed to obtain uniqueness. The implication of this cross-product constraint is that the elution profiles in different experiments may differ (e.g., due to shifting), but should still be somewhat similar. (B1)T(B1)=(B2)T(B2)=\u2026=(Bk)T(Bk) Fig. 2 illustrates the decomposition of the three-way array X. Detailed information about the model and algorithms is available .\nThe data used here comprise GC-MS landscapes of 24 samples of red wines of different origin (Fig. 3 ) . A dynamic headspace-GC-MS (HS-GC-MS) system was used to measure the aroma profile of the wine samples. More information about the collection and the experimental set-up of the samples is available .\nTypical GC-MS problems are reflected in the data (e.g., severe changes in the shape of several peaks, severe shift in elution time, low intensity of peaks, baseline drift and overlapping peaks). Five areas of the data set were selected to reflect these problems (highlighted in solid squares in Fig. 3).\nCurrently, software for computing PARAFAC2 models is available from two sources. The first can be freely downloaded from the Internet . The second can be obtained from Eigenvector Research and is implemented in PLS_Toolbox v. 4.1 . Both algorithms work in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc. 2008). For this article, we used PARAFAC2 from PLS_Toolbox v. 4.1.\nFrom an analytical point of view, the estimated mass spectra as well as their corresponding concentrations cannot be negative, so non-negativity constraints were imposed for sample and MS loadings. In the PARAFAC2 algorithm available and used in this work , it is impossible to impose non-negativity constraints on the elution profiles, even though this would also be appropriate.\nThe selection of the correct number of factors is the most important aspect of the model in applying PARAFAC2. Because of the nature of the model, all parameter estimates (e.g., estimated elution profiles) depend on each other, so the correct number of factors must be used. Otherwise, the parameters will, at worst, be chemically meaningless, even though they are uniquely determined mathematically. In this article and in chromatographic analysis in general, it is advisable to resolve chromatographic peaks individually, hence to work on a small window or region of the elution-time dimension. That way, the quality of the models will be better, because indirect and direct correlations between different compounds do not affect the modeling and because the problem of choosing the number of factors is typically simplified significantly.\nIn the following, the number of factors was determined by assessing the explained variance for the model (Equation (3)) as well as scrutinizing the appearance of the parameters and the residuals. The explained variance was calculated as follows: %var=100\u00d71-SSESSX where SSE is the sum of the squares of the residuals and SSX is the sum of the squares of the elements of the three-way array. Furthermore, visual interpretation of the results (such as residuals) was used to guide the selection.\nAll the MS loadings obtained were scaled in order to compare with experimental mass spectra. The experimental mass spectra were obtained from a run of the pure analyte, if this was identified from the chromatographic software. Otherwise, we used an average of all mass spectra from all scans constituting an individual peak. We made the comparison by calculating the similarity between the experimental mass spectrum and the calculated loading. This was calculated as follows: fit(%)=100\u00d71-\u2211xi-xi\u23222\u2211xi2 where xi corresponds to the intensity for m/z equal to i for the experimental spectrum and xi\u2322 corresponds to the appropriate loading. The Wiley Library for identification of analytes in ChemStation was used to identify the structure of each analyte according to the experimental mass spectrum and the MS loading obtained with PARAFAC2.\nThe peaks in region \u201ca\u201d of the chromatogram (Fig. 3a) represent the classical problem of shifts in elution time. This is a well-defined peak, with high intensity (high signal-to-noise ratio). The peak of one sample is severely shifted but all the remaining ones are also shifted.\nFig. 4 shows results obtained with PARAFAC2. In this situation, it is easy to see that the PARAFAC2 model has to be developed with only one factor. As expected, PARAFAC2 is able to model the chromatogram of the peak for each sample (Fig. 4a).\nFig. 4b shows the relative concentration loading obtained for each sample. This concentration-loading value is an estimate of the area under each chromatographic peak. It can be used for calibration models for the analyte of interest. The mass spectrum obtained with PARAFAC2 perfectly matches the one obtained experimentally. The similarity is 99.9%.\nFig. 4c compares the mass spectrum obtained with PARAFAC2 (upper) and the real mass spectra (bottom). This peak was identified as acetic-acid ethyl ester .\nThe second region selected appears between scan 2635 and 2695. Looking at the enlargement in the inset (Fig. 3b), it is difficult to assess the number of analytes present because of the overlaps, shifts and baseline drift.\nAt first, there seems to be only two slightly overlapping peaks. The explained variance of a PARAFAC2 model with two factors is 97.25%, which is on the low side for data such as these (Table 2 ). The residuals of this model trends present that may indicate that two factors are not enough to explain the systematic variation in the data, probably due to a baseline effect reflected in the background mass spectrum. A PARAFAC2 model with three factors explains more than 99%. Fig. 5 a and b show the chromatographic loadings and the relative concentrations for factor 1 (solid), factor 2 (dashed) and, what is more important, for the background (dotted).\nThe two chemical analytes have been identified as acetic acid-hexyl ester (Fig. 5c) and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (Fig. 5d), respectively. The background signal is most probably due to column bleeding, so it has a specific and consistent mass spectrum within the narrow elution-time window investigated and from this can be described in one PARAFAC2 factor (Fig. 5e). The chromatographic loadings are perfectly defined for each sample, handling the problems of shifts within elution-time profiles and across the samples, overlapping of peaks and baseline drift. The elution-time loading for the background (Fig. 5a) shows how the influence of the background remains almost constant throughout the different samples.\nThe similarity between the background mass spectrum obtained with PARAFAC2 and the mass spectrum obtained experimentally (electron-impact (EI) mass spectrum obtained from ) is more than 99.8%. The similarities for factor 1 and factor 2 mass spectra are 95.5% and 98.9%, respectively.\nWe need to point out that the shape of the chromatographic loading for one sample (red, Fig. 5a) does not have a very well-defined shape. This is merely an artifact due to the way the elution profiles are presented. As can be seen in the concentration mode (red circle, Fig. 5b), the concentration is approximately zero in the sample, so the (normalized) elution profile is not well defined.\nThe next two examples are devoted to showing how PARAFAC2 can help to obtain the mass spectrum of an analyte whose signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Qualitative as well as quantitative analysis is then difficult, because the mass spectrum of the analyte is greatly affected by the background mass spectrum. The elution-time regions between 4340 and 4390 scans (Fig. 3c) and 5500 and 5700 scans (Fig. 3d) reflect problems encountered with low-intensity peaks. Such areas are often not studied because of the low quality of the signal and the high interference of the baseline drift.\nThe first case (Fig. 3c) again reflects the situation where some analytes are absent in some samples, and the peak is greatly affected by the background interference, and that causes low signal-to-noise ratios. As can be expected, PARAFAC2 allows modeling of the chromatographic profile even if there is no analyte (Table 2, Fig. 6 a). The estimated mass spectrum obtained for factor 1 identifies the peak as ethyl dec-9-enoate (Fig. 6c), and the chromatographic loading reflects that there are two samples with a concentration of the analyte close to zero (Fig. 6a and b). Once again, the similarity between mass spectrum obtained for background and the experimental one is above 99.5%.\nIn the second case (Fig. 3d), the peak of the analyte, which is perfectly separated from the background using two factors, is obtained using PARAFAC2 (Fig. 7 a and b). In this case, the chromatographic peak was identified as a common contaminant in GC-MS analysis, bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (Fig. 7c). The mass spectrum obtained for the background perfectly matches the experimental one (similarity above 99.5%).\nAs shown above, PARAFAC2 has a remarkable ability to extract chemical information even in cases of low-intensity signals. Nevertheless, we also need to mention and study situations where the model cannot handle the chromatographic data.\nApart from the time for model calculation (that can be minutes to hours on current state-of-the-art personal computers), the main problem of PARAFAC2 is the need to determine the correct number of factors.\nAn example of the difficulty in determining the number of factors can be found in the area between scans 2100 and 2500 (Fig. 3e). Apparently, there are two peaks in this elution-time interval, so a PARAFAC2 model with two factors would be expected to model both peaks (maybe three if baseline is modeled as well). Nevertheless, the chromatographic loadings obtained for the model with two factors are very different from those expected (results not shown). The first factor involves both peaks, whereas the second factor seems to be an artifact of the mathematical model. This result may indicate an incorrect number of factors were chosen, and both peaks may belong to the same analyte, but in isomeric forms. Nevertheless, these peaks were identified as isoamyl alcohol and hexanoic acid ethyl ester, respectively. The mass spectra of these analytes are indeed different.\nFurther analysis of the raw data between 2250 and 2350 scans indicated that the mass spectrum obtained at scan 2306 (Fig. 8 a) and scan 2325 (Fig. 8b) for sample 1 (as an example) differ in shape. Ideally, all the mass channels have to increase in intensity in the second scan with respect to the first. Nevertheless, there are several mass channels that decrease in intensity (e.g., channels m/z 53 and 54). This may be caused by a perfect co-elution problem of several analytes at low concentration. As mentioned above, the peak was identified as isoamylic alcohol (3-methyl-butanol). It is well known that isomeric forms of methyl-butanol can co-elute .\nA PARAFAC2 model with two and three factors was fitted to the first peak, obtaining models that explained 99.5% and more than 99.9% of the total variance, respectively (Fig. 9 , Table 2). The model with two factors seems to indicate that, effectively, the co-elution of, at least, two isomeric forms of methyl-butanol occurs (Fig. 9a). The dashed peak was identified as isoamylic alcohol (3-methyl-butanol); whereas the dotted peak was identified as 2-methyl-butanol.\nDespite the apparent success of the model, several problems still remain (red-marked samples). The elution profiles obtained for the PARAFAC2 model with three factors (Fig. 9b) allow clear identification of 3-methyl-butanol (dotted) and 2-methyl-butanol (dashed), having a very well-defined shape. Furthermore, a third factor has been modeled (solid). The profile of its mass spectrum is highly correlated with the mass spectrum of 3-methyl-butanol. This may indicate that, apart from the co-elution problem, other variability sources exist in the raw dataset that do not allow a fully satisfactory PARAFAC2 model to be obtained.\nWe have demonstrated that PARAFAC2 is a powerful tool for solving problems derived from experimental variability in GC-MS data. The variance explained in all models was above 99%. The mass spectra obtained matched the real mass spectra, even for the background and for analytes of very low intensity, and even where standard chromatographic software would not have been able to provide meaningful results.\nPARAFAC2 handled problems, such as baseline drifts, differently shaped peaks, overlapping peaks or even low signal-to-noise ratios. This capability and the uniqueness property of the mass spectra allow PARAFAC2 to resolve low-intensity peaks so that MS loadings can be used for qualitative purposes (identification) and that the relative concentration obtained can be used for quantitative determination of the analytes.\nThe technique that we have presented can also be used for other hyphenated separation techniques (e.g., HPLC-UV and LC-MS), where peak shift, peak-shape changes and baseline contributions are often even bigger issues."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe synthesis and application of low-dimensional semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs), consisting of inorganic compounds with nanometer dimensions, is attracting a lot of attention in recent years . In particular, luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals, or \u201cquantum dots\u201d (QDs), have generated a great interest in fundamental research and also in their applications in optoelectronics, analytical chemistry, etc.\nA quantum dot is a semiconductor particle that has all three dimensions confined to the nanometer length scale [2]. Because of their small size (1\u201310 nm) these materials display unique properties unlike the bulk material, due to quantum-size confinement effects, which occur when metal and semiconductor particles are smaller than their exciton Bohr radii [3,4]. The strong confinement of excited electrons and holes leads to dramatically different optical and electronic properties compared to the bulk semiconductor. These usually non-fluorescing compounds develop an intense and long-lasting emission excitable by UV and visible light. Compared with organic fluorescent dyes, the QDs exhibit important advantages, including large fluorescence quantum yields, narrow and Gaussian emission spectra (full height wide maximum ~30 nm), tunable maximum wavelength of emission by controlling the QD size (varying the size from 1 to 7 nm allows most visible colours to be generated) and less susceptibility to photobleaching\nSince the first reports using modified core\u2013shell QDs as fluorescence labels to stain biological samples many publications have appeared reporting applications of such nanostructures as luminescent indicators of different biological processes (e.g. detection of specific receptor\u2013ligand interactions in cells, fluoroimmunoassays and recognition of biotoxins) . Attempts to extend the use of QDs as a new class of luminophores for their use in chemical sensing are now starting [2].\nSo far, very few reports of chemical sensing of small molecules and ions with QDs, via analyte-induced changes in photoluminescence, have been reported. Because the photoluminescence of QDs arises from the recombination of the exciton, it is reasonable to assume that the change of surface charges or components of QDs caused by the chemical or physical interaction between ions or small molecules and QDs affects the efficiency of core electron\u2013hole recombination . In this vein, the effect of butylamine as hole acceptor inducing the quenching of the QDs luminescence has been reported . Also, Diaz et al. showed that binding of MoS4 2\u2212 anions to the surface of CdS nanoparticles causes a red-shift of their absorption and emission bands as a result of effective electronic interaction of the modifier with the surface and core states of the CdS nanoparticles. In a recent paper, the photoluminescence of CdSe nanocrystals incorporated into poly(methylmethacrylate) films was found to respond reversibly to amines in gaseous phase .\nColloidal CdSe and CdS quantum dots are so far most studied, due to their tunable emission in the visible range, the advances in their preparation, and their potential use for industrial and biomedical applications. Coating the surface of these nanocrystals with suitable surface ligands has profound effects on the photoluminescence response of the QDs to some chemical species. In fact, one of the first practical uses of QDs as chemical sensing materials was described for the determination of zinc and copper ions in aqueous media. This application took advantage of the enhancement by zinc and the quenching by copper of the observed luminescence of CdS quantum dots capped with different organic ligands . More recently, peptide-coated CdS quantum dots have been synthesized for optical detection of Cu(II) and Ag(I) . Expanding applications of QDs to develop inorganic anion sensors is a topic of current interest. Particularly, anion recognition chemistry based on chemical and supramolecular recognition interactions has been an active research field for many years. However, to our knowledge, the use of QDs or nanocrystals as selective luminophor indicators for anion detection is almost unexplored. In fact, a few years ago, Lakowicz et al. reported the quenching effect of iodide on the fluorescence of CdS. However, a high concentration of the anion (0.2 M) was used for the detection of QD luminescence changes, being such concentration too high for practical analytical applications.\nThe synthesis of red photoluminescent CdSe quantum dots, their surface modification with tert-butyl-N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-carbamate (BMC) and their potential application, as a selective fluorescent probe, for the determination of free cyanide are reported in this work.\nAll chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.\nCadmium oxide (99.99%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), selenium (powder, 100 mesh, 99.99%), BMC, anhydrous methanol and anhydrous chloroform were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Hexylphosphonic acid (HPA) was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) and the tetrabutylammonium salts of the different anions studied (CN\u2212, NO3 \u2212, Cl\u2212, SCN\u2212 and Br\u2212) were from Fluka (Madrid, Spain).\nThe selenium stock solution was prepared in an Ar-filled dry-box by dissolving 0.12 g of selenium powder in 6 g (7.22 ml) of TOP, to produce a 0.21 M stock solution of trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) .\nCdSe quantum dots ranging from 2 to 7 nm in diameter were synthesized via the procedure described by Peng et al. using CdO as precursor, although some slight modifications were made here. Briefly, 0.03 g of CdO, 0.11 g of HPA and 3.5 g of TOPO were loaded into a 25 ml glass flask. The mixture was heated to 300\u2013320 \u00b0C under argon flow for 15\u201320 min, and CdO was dissolved in HPA and TOPO. The temperature of the solution was then cooled to 270 \u00b0C, 1.2 ml selenium stock solution was swiftly injected and a change of solution color to red was observed. After injection, nanocrystals were left to grew for about 20 min at 250 \u00b0C.\nYellow and brown QDs were also prepared in a similar way by varying the ratio of CdO to Se used (yellow QDs were obtained for 0.0396 g of CdO, while brown QDs were obtained for 0.0254 g of CdO, employed in the synthesis). Yellow QDs were obtained when a molar ratio CdO/Se of 1.20 was ensured during the synthesis process, while red and brown QDs were obtained varying the amount of CdO added in order to obtain molar ratios CdO/Se of 0.90 and 0.77, respectively. After cooling the solution up to room temperature, the QDs solution was transferred to a glass vial and diluted with chloroform (to obtain a final volume of approximately 10 ml). Then, the synthesized QDs were purified by adding 5 ml of methanol to 3 ml of the QDs solution in a 10 ml tube. After sonication in a ultrasonic bath for 2\u20134 min (until homogenization of the mixture), the solution was centrifuged (at about 15,000 rpm), in order to separate the QDs by precipitation. Afterwards, the supernatant liquid phase was decanted to remove any excess of reagents. The purified QD nanocrystals were then dispersed in 10 ml of anhydrous chloroform.\nFor the surface modification of the quantum dots, about 20 mg of purified CdSe QDs were added into 15 ml methanol solution containing 1.0 ml BMC and 1.5 ml tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (~25%). The solution was refluxed for 24 h. The modified QDs were then separated and purified as previously described and then dispersed in methanol.\nOnce the synthesis is finished, the QDs (both modified and unmodified) nanocrystal properties remained unaltered after the purification process (including repeated dissolution and precipitations). Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs.\nCdSe QDs are insoluble in many typical solvents, but the synthesized QDs, following the described procedure (using TOP/TOPO) are soluble in chloroform. Besides, the obtained BMC-CdSe QDs are soluble in methanol (due to the nature of the organic ligand that favors the QDs solubilization in such solvent).\nSynthesized QDs were stored in glass vials in the darkness and, as a rule, exposed to sunlight under ambient conditions for a minimum of 2 days before use. In some experiments, the QDs methanolic solution was placed in a conventional luminescence quartz cell and exposed to a 400 nm light in the sample compartment of the luminometer.\nMost of the reagents used during the synthesis of the different QDs are toxic. Protective clothing and gloves should be worn. Also eye/face protection should be used. No other special safety precautions are necessary if the reagents are used correctly. Particularly, cadmium oxide and TOPO are highly toxic reagents. Special care should be taken to avoid release of these reagents to the environment. These materials and the containers must be disposed as hazardous waste.\nUV\u2013VIS absorption spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-20 UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer. The luminescence spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. Dilute solutions of QDs in methanol were placed in 1 cm quartz cuvettes and their absorption and corresponding fluorescence were measured.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were carried out with JEOL-2000EX II high resolution electron microscope to obtain high-resolution images of individual QDs. Samples were prepared by placing one drop of a dilute solution of QDs in methanol onto a copper grid supporting a thin plastic film and then removing the remaining solvent in about 2 min with the help of a hot air flux.\nLuminescence lifetime measurements were performed with a home-made frequency-domain luminometer based on a laser excitation source (337 nm) and a photomultiplier tube as light detector (at 565 nm). Lifetimes were obtained from the measurement of the phase shift of the excitation light and the luminescence emission [29].\nFirst of all, the spectral properties of the surface-modified BMC-CdSe NPs were investigated as a function of the ratio CdO to Se selected during the synthesis of CdSe quantum dots. Fig. 2 a shows the observed absorption spectra of the three different BMC-CdSe quantum dots dispersed in methanol solution. As expected, the absorption spectral characteristics of the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs were considerably influenced by the CdO to Se molar ratio (which influences the nanoparticle size). As can be seen, the first excitonic band is situated at 526 nm for the yellow QDs (ratio CdO/Se: 1.20), at 552 nm for the red QDs (ratio CdO/Se: 0.90) and at 580 nm for the brown QDs (ratio CdO/Se: 0.77). Modifications of the surface of the QDs (e.g. functionalization of the QDs surface with the organic ligand) did not produce noticeable changes of the absorption spectra. In fact, the observed unmodified CdSe QDs absorption spectra were similar to those of surface-modified BMC-CdSe QDs.\nLuminescence properties of the QDs were also investigated. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, BMC-CdSe quantum dots dispersed in methanol exhibit a strong fluorescence emission at 551 nm (yellow QDs), 590 nm (red QDs) and 647 nm (brown QDs) under 400 nm light excitation. As noticed for the UV\u2013VIS absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra of modified BMC-CdSe QDs were similar to the spectra obtained for pure CdSe QDs. Luminescence lifetimes of surface-modified BMC-CdSe QDs in methanol were also measured and turned out to be rather long (from 300 to 600 ns).\nThe particle sizes of the synthesized QDs were measured from high resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Fig. 3a shows the TEM image of the obtained red CdSe QDs, with their surface modified with BMC, in methanolic solution. Almost spherical particles were observed. TEM images indicate diameters of the functionalized CdSe nanoparticles between 2 and 7 nm. However, it is worth noting that only a small percentage of the total particles showed a diameter size greater than 5 nm.\nBesides, some large particles (Fig. 3b) are also apparent in the Figure, indicating aggregation of NPs. These aggregates may be formed at relatively high QD concentrations (most likely during the solvent evaporation process of TEM experiments) via interconnection of the BMC capped CdSe QDs to form a three-dimensional CdSe QDs network.\nIt was noticed that exposure of the QDs to sunlight affected drastically their final fluorescence emission. Fig. 4 shows the observed effect of sunlight exposure time on the luminescence intensity and wavelength emission of red CdSe quantum dots. As can be seen, exposure of the red CdSe quantum dots chloroformic solutions to sunlight resulted in a considerable and continuous increase of the measured luminescence intensity, along with a blue-shift of the emission spectra (the solution color became canary yellow).\nAs uncoated CdSe QDs, the surface-modified BMC-CdSe QDs exhibited initially slight fluorescence. However, once exposed to sunlight, under ambient conditions for at least two days, BMC-CdSe QDs methanol solutions displayed intense fluorescent emission. Moreover, the emission wavelength maximum changed from 580 to about 550 nm (or even to shorter wavelengths).\nThis effect of photo-activation of semiconductor QDs irradiated with low-power light, resulting in the enhancement of luminescence intensity and in the blue-shifting of emission wavelength maximum, is a phenomenon reported in recent literature . Different mechanisms including photoinduced surface reconstruction of the surface atoms of the nanocrystals or the optimization of surface-ligand passivation induced by photon\u2013photon coupling have been proposed for this photoinduced activation [19], but the exact mechanism is not clear yet.\nAfter photo-activation for several days to obtain a constant emission signal the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs did not exhibit significant changes neither in their luminescence emission intensity nor in their sensitivity to cyanide, even after more that 2 months stored in the dark, at ambient conditions. Analytical measurements were carried out after the irradiated QDs luminescence signal was stable.\nWhen the sunlight photoactivated surface-modified BMC-CdSe quantum dots were exposed to 400 nm light in a conventional fluorescence quartz cell under sealed conditions (using a Parafilm\u00ae cover), the luminescence intensity did not change remarkably with exposure in the time interval investigated (about 4 h). However, when QDs were under contact with air (in an open quartz cell), luminescence intensity decayed slowly with time of exposure, as shown in Fig. 5 (probably the presence of oxygen results in photooxidation).\nTo investigate the photo-activated luminescence process further, once measured the fluorescence of 3 ml methanolic solution of BMC-CdSe QDs the quantum dots were precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm during 2 h. After precipitation, the luminescence of both, the supernatant and the solution resulting from re-dispersion of QDs in 3 ml methanol were measured. Fig. 6 shows the results.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, no significant luminescence emission was recorded coming from the supernatant or from methanol solutions. In other words, observed luminescence does not come from other possible chemical components in solution. As can be seen, re-dispersed NPs in methanol did exhibit again an intense fluorescence, confirming that recorded luminescence derives from the BMC-CdSe nanoparticles (rather than brought about by possible adsorbed components used in the preparation of the QDs). The observed loss of luminescence intensity of re-dispersed QDs in methanol (Fig. 6) is probably due to some adsorption of quantum dots onto centrifugation tube walls with the corresponding loss of luminescent particles dispersed in the methanolic solution.\nLuminescence emission of the BMC surface-modified CdSe QDs turned out to be highly sensitive to the presence of cyanide (tetrabutylammonium cyanide salts) in methanol. Fig. 7 a shows the effect of cyanide ions on fluorescence of QDs. As can be seen, the fluorescent emission was progressively quenched by the addition of cyanide. It should be mentioned that at the low cyanide concentration levels (in the order of 10\u22127 to 10\u22125 M) investigated in the manuscript, the effect of cyanide ions in the unmodified nanoparticles can be considered negligible.\nCyanide quenched surface-modified QDs were separated by centrifugation, re-dispersed in methanol and their fluorescence measured again. It was observed that the luminescence remained quenched. This result indicates that the quenching anions remained adsorbed or linked to the NPs.\nThe effect of CN\u2212 quencher on the decay time of the QDs fluorescence was also examined. As can be seen in Fig. 7b, fluorescence decay observed for BMC-CdSe in methanol changed with increasing additions of CN\u2212. This result indicates that the observed quenching process seems to be at least partially dynamic. In the absence of cyanide, the emission decay showed in Fig. 7b is dominated by two emission components, with corresponding lifetimes of about 300 and 600 ns, consistent with a photoluminescent model that includes multiple emission pathways. It was observed that only the lifetime values corresponding to the slowest decaying components of the BMC-CdSe QDs decreased significantly with the addition of low concentrations of cyanide.\nIn a homogeneous medium having only a single-component exponential decay, the quencher concentration could be obtain from the well known Stern\u2013Volmer relationship: I0I=1+Ksv[Q] where I 0 is the intensity of the luminescence phenomena from the luminophor in absence of quencher, and I the intensity of the luminophor when the quencher is present at concentration [Q]. Interestingly, the plots of I 0/I versus cyanide quencher concentration did not fit a conventional linear Stern\u2013Volmer equation. An steep upward curvature was observed (Fig. 8 ). This may indicate that both dynamic and static quenching seem to act together, here suggesting a more complex quenching model . The obtained experimental data for cyanide determination could be fitted, however, to the following empirical equation: lnI0I\u22121=0.142\u00d7107[Q]\u22122.022 obtaining a good linear relationship (r > 0.998), which could be used to develop a new trace cyanide determination method based on luminescence quenching of QDs.\nThe limit of detection, calculated following the 3\u03c3 IUPAC criteria, was 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M (2.9 \u03bcg l\u22121) of cyanide. It is interesting to note that the sensitivity of the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs to CN\u2212 detection was unaltered after more that 2 months storage of the sensing phase in the dark, at ambient conditions. The precision of the proposed methodology was determined in terms of repeatability (n = 5). R.S.D. values obtained were 2.1% for the determination of a cyanide concentration of 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 M. The quenching by cyanide anions is rather selective: the influence of other anions (including NO3 \u2212, Cl\u2212, SCN\u2212, NO2 \u2212, Br\u2212 and I\u2212) on the luminescence emission from the synthesized NPs was then investigated. Results obtained showed that NO3 \u2212, Cl\u2212, SCN\u2212 did not exhibit any significant effect on the photoluminescence emission of the QDs, even at concentration levels over 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M. However, concentrations of I\u2212 and NO2 \u2212 (over 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) or Br\u2212 (over 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M) produced quenching of the luminescence of the QDs. Fig. 8 resumes the quenching effects of the different anions tested on the luminescence of the NPs. As can be seen, the maximum slope was observed for cyanide quenching, thus indicating that at very low concentrations (typically important in environmentally studies) the effect of other studied anions on QDs luminescence is rather low, pointing to a useful system to develop a cyanide optosensing device based on such measurements.\nResults found here could also suggest some possible quenching mechanisms of the luminescence of QDs by cyanide: first, the interaction of the cyanide (strong ligand) with the functional groups of the QDs modified surface would bring about a disruption by cyanide of the hydrogen bonds between the BMC groups of the surface-modified CdSe QDs (Fig. 1). This would result in a destabilisation of the QDs in solution, with a modification of their luminescence. Also, as a result of the very high surface-to-volume ratio of these nanoparticles, cyanide adsorption on this high surface could be expected. In fact, it has been recently described that the adsorption of negatively charged cyanide on the surface of films of CdSe quantum dots resulted in an increased electron localization due to compression of the electron wave function in the dots and therefore an increase of the size quantization (size-dependent increase in band gap) of the QDs was observed which could account for the observed quenching of luminescence emission by cyanide.\nStudies to obtain functionalised nanoparticles of CdSe semiconductor QDs have been carried out. tert-Butyl-N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-carbamate and CdSe quantum dots have been successfully combined to develop a novel and highly sensitive luminescence nanoprobe for optical recognition of cyanide. Quenching of the luminescence emitted by the synthesized nanoparticles allows the detection of cyanide concentration as low as 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M, thus affording a very sensitive detection system for this toxic chemical species.\nThe synthesized QDs have shown long emission wavelengths and a high separation between the excitation and emission wavelengths (over 100 nm) simplifying photoluminescent measurements.\nA disadvantage of the synthesized QDs, however, is that they were insoluble in water, a clear limitation for environmental applications. However, the possibility of modifying the chemistry of the core\u2013shell system in the QDs, by adding different water soluble organic ligands, is already in progress in our laboratory. In any case, the synthesized surface-functionalized nanoparticles have a considerable potential as optical nanoprobes and are opening new applications via their immobilization in membranes or resin-based solid surfaces. Such optosensing strategies are in progress in our laboratory and could eventually allow the development of highly sensitive and selective optosensors for cyanide traces determinations based either on fluorescence intensity or on lifetime changes induced by the analyte in the surface-modified QDs.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "The synthesis and application of low-dimensional semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs), consisting of inorganic compounds with nanometer dimensions, is attracting a lot of attention in recent years . In particular, luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals, or \u201cquantum dots\u201d (QDs), have generated a great interest in fundamental research and also in their applications in optoelectronics, analytical chemistry, etc.\nA quantum dot is a semiconductor particle that has all three dimensions confined to the nanometer length scale [2]. Because of their small size (1\u201310 nm) these materials display unique properties unlike the bulk material, due to quantum-size confinement effects, which occur when metal and semiconductor particles are smaller than their exciton Bohr radii [3,4]. The strong confinement of excited electrons and holes leads to dramatically different optical and electronic properties compared to the bulk semiconductor. These usually non-fluorescing compounds develop an intense and long-lasting emission excitable by UV and visible light. Compared with organic fluorescent dyes, the QDs exhibit important advantages, including large fluorescence quantum yields, narrow and Gaussian emission spectra (full height wide maximum ~30 nm), tunable maximum wavelength of emission by controlling the QD size (varying the size from 1 to 7 nm allows most visible colours to be generated) and less susceptibility to photobleaching\nSince the first reports using modified core\u2013shell QDs as fluorescence labels to stain biological samples many publications have appeared reporting applications of such nanostructures as luminescent indicators of different biological processes (e.g. detection of specific receptor\u2013ligand interactions in cells, fluoroimmunoassays and recognition of biotoxins) . Attempts to extend the use of QDs as a new class of luminophores for their use in chemical sensing are now starting [2].\nSo far, very few reports of chemical sensing of small molecules and ions with QDs, via analyte-induced changes in photoluminescence, have been reported. Because the photoluminescence of QDs arises from the recombination of the exciton, it is reasonable to assume that the change of surface charges or components of QDs caused by the chemical or physical interaction between ions or small molecules and QDs affects the efficiency of core electron\u2013hole recombination . In this vein, the effect of butylamine as hole acceptor inducing the quenching of the QDs luminescence has been reported . Also, Diaz et al. showed that binding of MoS4 2\u2212 anions to the surface of CdS nanoparticles causes a red-shift of their absorption and emission bands as a result of effective electronic interaction of the modifier with the surface and core states of the CdS nanoparticles. In a recent paper, the photoluminescence of CdSe nanocrystals incorporated into poly(methylmethacrylate) films was found to respond reversibly to amines in gaseous phase .\nColloidal CdSe and CdS quantum dots are so far most studied, due to their tunable emission in the visible range, the advances in their preparation, and their potential use for industrial and biomedical applications. Coating the surface of these nanocrystals with suitable surface ligands has profound effects on the photoluminescence response of the QDs to some chemical species. In fact, one of the first practical uses of QDs as chemical sensing materials was described for the determination of zinc and copper ions in aqueous media. This application took advantage of the enhancement by zinc and the quenching by copper of the observed luminescence of CdS quantum dots capped with different organic ligands . More recently, peptide-coated CdS quantum dots have been synthesized for optical detection of Cu(II) and Ag(I) . Expanding applications of QDs to develop inorganic anion sensors is a topic of current interest. Particularly, anion recognition chemistry based on chemical and supramolecular recognition interactions has been an active research field for many years. However, to our knowledge, the use of QDs or nanocrystals as selective luminophor indicators for anion detection is almost unexplored. In fact, a few years ago, Lakowicz et al. reported the quenching effect of iodide on the fluorescence of CdS. However, a high concentration of the anion (0.2 M) was used for the detection of QD luminescence changes, being such concentration too high for practical analytical applications.\nThe synthesis of red photoluminescent CdSe quantum dots, their surface modification with tert-butyl-N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-carbamate (BMC) and their potential application, as a selective fluorescent probe, for the determination of free cyanide are reported in this work.\nAll chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.\nCadmium oxide (99.99%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), selenium (powder, 100 mesh, 99.99%), BMC, anhydrous methanol and anhydrous chloroform were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Hexylphosphonic acid (HPA) was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) and the tetrabutylammonium salts of the different anions studied (CN\u2212, NO3 \u2212, Cl\u2212, SCN\u2212 and Br\u2212) were from Fluka (Madrid, Spain).\nThe selenium stock solution was prepared in an Ar-filled dry-box by dissolving 0.12 g of selenium powder in 6 g (7.22 ml) of TOP, to produce a 0.21 M stock solution of trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) .\nCdSe quantum dots ranging from 2 to 7 nm in diameter were synthesized via the procedure described by Peng et al. using CdO as precursor, although some slight modifications were made here. Briefly, 0.03 g of CdO, 0.11 g of HPA and 3.5 g of TOPO were loaded into a 25 ml glass flask. The mixture was heated to 300\u2013320 \u00b0C under argon flow for 15\u201320 min, and CdO was dissolved in HPA and TOPO. The temperature of the solution was then cooled to 270 \u00b0C, 1.2 ml selenium stock solution was swiftly injected and a change of solution color to red was observed. After injection, nanocrystals were left to grew for about 20 min at 250 \u00b0C.\nYellow and brown QDs were also prepared in a similar way by varying the ratio of CdO to Se used (yellow QDs were obtained for 0.0396 g of CdO, while brown QDs were obtained for 0.0254 g of CdO, employed in the synthesis). Yellow QDs were obtained when a molar ratio CdO/Se of 1.20 was ensured during the synthesis process, while red and brown QDs were obtained varying the amount of CdO added in order to obtain molar ratios CdO/Se of 0.90 and 0.77, respectively. After cooling the solution up to room temperature, the QDs solution was transferred to a glass vial and diluted with chloroform (to obtain a final volume of approximately 10 ml). Then, the synthesized QDs were purified by adding 5 ml of methanol to 3 ml of the QDs solution in a 10 ml tube. After sonication in a ultrasonic bath for 2\u20134 min (until homogenization of the mixture), the solution was centrifuged (at about 15,000 rpm), in order to separate the QDs by precipitation. Afterwards, the supernatant liquid phase was decanted to remove any excess of reagents. The purified QD nanocrystals were then dispersed in 10 ml of anhydrous chloroform.\nFor the surface modification of the quantum dots, about 20 mg of purified CdSe QDs were added into 15 ml methanol solution containing 1.0 ml BMC and 1.5 ml tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (~25%). The solution was refluxed for 24 h. The modified QDs were then separated and purified as previously described and then dispersed in methanol.\nOnce the synthesis is finished, the QDs (both modified and unmodified) nanocrystal properties remained unaltered after the purification process (including repeated dissolution and precipitations). Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs.\nCdSe QDs are insoluble in many typical solvents, but the synthesized QDs, following the described procedure (using TOP/TOPO) are soluble in chloroform. Besides, the obtained BMC-CdSe QDs are soluble in methanol (due to the nature of the organic ligand that favors the QDs solubilization in such solvent).\nSynthesized QDs were stored in glass vials in the darkness and, as a rule, exposed to sunlight under ambient conditions for a minimum of 2 days before use. In some experiments, the QDs methanolic solution was placed in a conventional luminescence quartz cell and exposed to a 400 nm light in the sample compartment of the luminometer.\nMost of the reagents used during the synthesis of the different QDs are toxic. Protective clothing and gloves should be worn. Also eye/face protection should be used. No other special safety precautions are necessary if the reagents are used correctly. Particularly, cadmium oxide and TOPO are highly toxic reagents. Special care should be taken to avoid release of these reagents to the environment. These materials and the containers must be disposed as hazardous waste.\nUV\u2013VIS absorption spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-20 UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer. The luminescence spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. Dilute solutions of QDs in methanol were placed in 1 cm quartz cuvettes and their absorption and corresponding fluorescence were measured.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were carried out with JEOL-2000EX II high resolution electron microscope to obtain high-resolution images of individual QDs. Samples were prepared by placing one drop of a dilute solution of QDs in methanol onto a copper grid supporting a thin plastic film and then removing the remaining solvent in about 2 min with the help of a hot air flux.\nLuminescence lifetime measurements were performed with a home-made frequency-domain luminometer based on a laser excitation source (337 nm) and a photomultiplier tube as light detector (at 565 nm). Lifetimes were obtained from the measurement of the phase shift of the excitation light and the luminescence emission [29].\nFirst of all, the spectral properties of the surface-modified BMC-CdSe NPs were investigated as a function of the ratio CdO to Se selected during the synthesis of CdSe quantum dots. Fig. 2 a shows the observed absorption spectra of the three different BMC-CdSe quantum dots dispersed in methanol solution. As expected, the absorption spectral characteristics of the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs were considerably influenced by the CdO to Se molar ratio (which influences the nanoparticle size). As can be seen, the first excitonic band is situated at 526 nm for the yellow QDs (ratio CdO/Se: 1.20), at 552 nm for the red QDs (ratio CdO/Se: 0.90) and at 580 nm for the brown QDs (ratio CdO/Se: 0.77). Modifications of the surface of the QDs (e.g. functionalization of the QDs surface with the organic ligand) did not produce noticeable changes of the absorption spectra. In fact, the observed unmodified CdSe QDs absorption spectra were similar to those of surface-modified BMC-CdSe QDs.\nLuminescence properties of the QDs were also investigated. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, BMC-CdSe quantum dots dispersed in methanol exhibit a strong fluorescence emission at 551 nm (yellow QDs), 590 nm (red QDs) and 647 nm (brown QDs) under 400 nm light excitation. As noticed for the UV\u2013VIS absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra of modified BMC-CdSe QDs were similar to the spectra obtained for pure CdSe QDs. Luminescence lifetimes of surface-modified BMC-CdSe QDs in methanol were also measured and turned out to be rather long (from 300 to 600 ns).\nThe particle sizes of the synthesized QDs were measured from high resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Fig. 3a shows the TEM image of the obtained red CdSe QDs, with their surface modified with BMC, in methanolic solution. Almost spherical particles were observed. TEM images indicate diameters of the functionalized CdSe nanoparticles between 2 and 7 nm. However, it is worth noting that only a small percentage of the total particles showed a diameter size greater than 5 nm.\nBesides, some large particles (Fig. 3b) are also apparent in the Figure, indicating aggregation of NPs. These aggregates may be formed at relatively high QD concentrations (most likely during the solvent evaporation process of TEM experiments) via interconnection of the BMC capped CdSe QDs to form a three-dimensional CdSe QDs network.\nIt was noticed that exposure of the QDs to sunlight affected drastically their final fluorescence emission. Fig. 4 shows the observed effect of sunlight exposure time on the luminescence intensity and wavelength emission of red CdSe quantum dots. As can be seen, exposure of the red CdSe quantum dots chloroformic solutions to sunlight resulted in a considerable and continuous increase of the measured luminescence intensity, along with a blue-shift of the emission spectra (the solution color became canary yellow).\nAs uncoated CdSe QDs, the surface-modified BMC-CdSe QDs exhibited initially slight fluorescence. However, once exposed to sunlight, under ambient conditions for at least two days, BMC-CdSe QDs methanol solutions displayed intense fluorescent emission. Moreover, the emission wavelength maximum changed from 580 to about 550 nm (or even to shorter wavelengths).\nThis effect of photo-activation of semiconductor QDs irradiated with low-power light, resulting in the enhancement of luminescence intensity and in the blue-shifting of emission wavelength maximum, is a phenomenon reported in recent literature . Different mechanisms including photoinduced surface reconstruction of the surface atoms of the nanocrystals or the optimization of surface-ligand passivation induced by photon\u2013photon coupling have been proposed for this photoinduced activation [19], but the exact mechanism is not clear yet.\nAfter photo-activation for several days to obtain a constant emission signal the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs did not exhibit significant changes neither in their luminescence emission intensity nor in their sensitivity to cyanide, even after more that 2 months stored in the dark, at ambient conditions. Analytical measurements were carried out after the irradiated QDs luminescence signal was stable.\nWhen the sunlight photoactivated surface-modified BMC-CdSe quantum dots were exposed to 400 nm light in a conventional fluorescence quartz cell under sealed conditions (using a Parafilm\u00ae cover), the luminescence intensity did not change remarkably with exposure in the time interval investigated (about 4 h). However, when QDs were under contact with air (in an open quartz cell), luminescence intensity decayed slowly with time of exposure, as shown in Fig. 5 (probably the presence of oxygen results in photooxidation).\nTo investigate the photo-activated luminescence process further, once measured the fluorescence of 3 ml methanolic solution of BMC-CdSe QDs the quantum dots were precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm during 2 h. After precipitation, the luminescence of both, the supernatant and the solution resulting from re-dispersion of QDs in 3 ml methanol were measured. Fig. 6 shows the results.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, no significant luminescence emission was recorded coming from the supernatant or from methanol solutions. In other words, observed luminescence does not come from other possible chemical components in solution. As can be seen, re-dispersed NPs in methanol did exhibit again an intense fluorescence, confirming that recorded luminescence derives from the BMC-CdSe nanoparticles (rather than brought about by possible adsorbed components used in the preparation of the QDs). The observed loss of luminescence intensity of re-dispersed QDs in methanol (Fig. 6) is probably due to some adsorption of quantum dots onto centrifugation tube walls with the corresponding loss of luminescent particles dispersed in the methanolic solution.\nLuminescence emission of the BMC surface-modified CdSe QDs turned out to be highly sensitive to the presence of cyanide (tetrabutylammonium cyanide salts) in methanol. Fig. 7 a shows the effect of cyanide ions on fluorescence of QDs. As can be seen, the fluorescent emission was progressively quenched by the addition of cyanide. It should be mentioned that at the low cyanide concentration levels (in the order of 10\u22127 to 10\u22125 M) investigated in the manuscript, the effect of cyanide ions in the unmodified nanoparticles can be considered negligible.\nCyanide quenched surface-modified QDs were separated by centrifugation, re-dispersed in methanol and their fluorescence measured again. It was observed that the luminescence remained quenched. This result indicates that the quenching anions remained adsorbed or linked to the NPs.\nThe effect of CN\u2212 quencher on the decay time of the QDs fluorescence was also examined. As can be seen in Fig. 7b, fluorescence decay observed for BMC-CdSe in methanol changed with increasing additions of CN\u2212. This result indicates that the observed quenching process seems to be at least partially dynamic. In the absence of cyanide, the emission decay showed in Fig. 7b is dominated by two emission components, with corresponding lifetimes of about 300 and 600 ns, consistent with a photoluminescent model that includes multiple emission pathways. It was observed that only the lifetime values corresponding to the slowest decaying components of the BMC-CdSe QDs decreased significantly with the addition of low concentrations of cyanide.\nIn a homogeneous medium having only a single-component exponential decay, the quencher concentration could be obtain from the well known Stern\u2013Volmer relationship: I0I=1+Ksv[Q] where I 0 is the intensity of the luminescence phenomena from the luminophor in absence of quencher, and I the intensity of the luminophor when the quencher is present at concentration [Q]. Interestingly, the plots of I 0/I versus cyanide quencher concentration did not fit a conventional linear Stern\u2013Volmer equation. An steep upward curvature was observed (Fig. 8 ). This may indicate that both dynamic and static quenching seem to act together, here suggesting a more complex quenching model . The obtained experimental data for cyanide determination could be fitted, however, to the following empirical equation: lnI0I\u22121=0.142\u00d7107[Q]\u22122.022 obtaining a good linear relationship (r > 0.998), which could be used to develop a new trace cyanide determination method based on luminescence quenching of QDs.\nThe limit of detection, calculated following the 3\u03c3 IUPAC criteria, was 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M (2.9 \u03bcg l\u22121) of cyanide. It is interesting to note that the sensitivity of the synthesized BMC-CdSe QDs to CN\u2212 detection was unaltered after more that 2 months storage of the sensing phase in the dark, at ambient conditions. The precision of the proposed methodology was determined in terms of repeatability (n = 5). R.S.D. values obtained were 2.1% for the determination of a cyanide concentration of 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 M. The quenching by cyanide anions is rather selective: the influence of other anions (including NO3 \u2212, Cl\u2212, SCN\u2212, NO2 \u2212, Br\u2212 and I\u2212) on the luminescence emission from the synthesized NPs was then investigated. Results obtained showed that NO3 \u2212, Cl\u2212, SCN\u2212 did not exhibit any significant effect on the photoluminescence emission of the QDs, even at concentration levels over 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M. However, concentrations of I\u2212 and NO2 \u2212 (over 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) or Br\u2212 (over 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M) produced quenching of the luminescence of the QDs. Fig. 8 resumes the quenching effects of the different anions tested on the luminescence of the NPs. As can be seen, the maximum slope was observed for cyanide quenching, thus indicating that at very low concentrations (typically important in environmentally studies) the effect of other studied anions on QDs luminescence is rather low, pointing to a useful system to develop a cyanide optosensing device based on such measurements.\nResults found here could also suggest some possible quenching mechanisms of the luminescence of QDs by cyanide: first, the interaction of the cyanide (strong ligand) with the functional groups of the QDs modified surface would bring about a disruption by cyanide of the hydrogen bonds between the BMC groups of the surface-modified CdSe QDs (Fig. 1). This would result in a destabilisation of the QDs in solution, with a modification of their luminescence. Also, as a result of the very high surface-to-volume ratio of these nanoparticles, cyanide adsorption on this high surface could be expected. In fact, it has been recently described that the adsorption of negatively charged cyanide on the surface of films of CdSe quantum dots resulted in an increased electron localization due to compression of the electron wave function in the dots and therefore an increase of the size quantization (size-dependent increase in band gap) of the QDs was observed which could account for the observed quenching of luminescence emission by cyanide.\nStudies to obtain functionalised nanoparticles of CdSe semiconductor QDs have been carried out. tert-Butyl-N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-carbamate and CdSe quantum dots have been successfully combined to develop a novel and highly sensitive luminescence nanoprobe for optical recognition of cyanide. Quenching of the luminescence emitted by the synthesized nanoparticles allows the detection of cyanide concentration as low as 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M, thus affording a very sensitive detection system for this toxic chemical species.\nThe synthesized QDs have shown long emission wavelengths and a high separation between the excitation and emission wavelengths (over 100 nm) simplifying photoluminescent measurements.\nA disadvantage of the synthesized QDs, however, is that they were insoluble in water, a clear limitation for environmental applications. However, the possibility of modifying the chemistry of the core\u2013shell system in the QDs, by adding different water soluble organic ligands, is already in progress in our laboratory. In any case, the synthesized surface-functionalized nanoparticles have a considerable potential as optical nanoprobes and are opening new applications via their immobilization in membranes or resin-based solid surfaces. Such optosensing strategies are in progress in our laboratory and could eventually allow the development of highly sensitive and selective optosensors for cyanide traces determinations based either on fluorescence intensity or on lifetime changes induced by the analyte in the surface-modified QDs."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nInorganic modified electrodes are widely used in many areas, such as electroanalysis and site-selective electrocatalysis , electrochromic devices , electrochemical power sources and materials science , photocurrent response studies , protection against corrosion , and interfacial charge and electron transfer , etc. Since the pioneering work of Neff and Itaya et al. on Prussian blue modified electrodes, various inorganic materials such as clays , zeolites , transition metal oxides , metal phthalocyanines , metal porphyrins , transition metal particles , polyoxo-metallate and polynuclear transition metal cyanides have been used to fabricate inorganic film modified electrodes. Of these, the transition metal hexacyanoferrate has received much attention. Considering the wide scope of electrochemical studies and their possible exploitation, attention is currently being paid to the preparation of a number of analogues of Prussian blue as revealed by the growing number of references on this subject . On careful examination of different reports on metal hexacyanoferrate-modified electrodes and their redox characteristics published so far, it is apparent that only a few have been found to be as successful as Prussian blue from the viewpoint of the varied applications listed above, perhaps due to the absence of the characteristics and reversible redox centres referred to in the case of Prussian blue. Among the many metal hexacyanoferrates, cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) is exceptional; it exhibits excellent reversible redox centres very similar to those of Prussian blue.\nElectrodes modified with CoHCF have been prepared recently where two different types of film were reported . One type has a redox couple and the other has two redox couples . Studies concerning the structural aspects of CoHCF and its magnetic properties were recently reported by Kulesza et al. and Sato et al. , respectively. Using voltammetry, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments, Kulesza et al. indicated that CoHCF has a rigid, cubic-type, zeolite structure composed of three orthogonal Fe\ue5f8C\ue606N\ue5f8Co chains in which both metals (Fe and Co) are octahedrally coordinated by six carbons and six nitrogens. The chemical environment of Co(II) in CoHCF, particularly the Co\ue5f8N bond lengths, is dependent on the nature and size of the alkali metal countercations, accommodated in the CoHCF structure. Sato et al. demonstrated that the cobalt iron cyanide thin film (about 0.5\u20130.1 \u03bcm thick), which was synthesized electrochemically on a platinum electrode under potentiostatic conditions at \u22120.4 V (vs. SCE) in aqueous solution, behaves as if it contained molecular magnets that exhibit long-time magnetic ordering or bistability with hysteresis. But the application of CoHCF modified electrodes has not been exploited very much. Green-Pedersen and Korshin studied the possibility of using the CoHCF modified graphic electrode to separate and transfer Cs+ from high sodium waters. Their results indicated that a thin layer of CoHCF was highly selective to Cs+ in the presence of overwhelmingly higher concentrations of Na+ and K+. Cs+ was incorporated into the electrode at 0 V and expelled at +1.0 V. Only a few papers have reported electrocatalytic reactions at the CoHCF film modified electrode; for example, we have reported the electrocatalytic activity of a CoHCF modified glassy carbon electrode toward NADH oxidation and other authors have reported electrocatalytic oxidation of hydroxylamine, nitrite, thiosulfate, hydrazine and p-chlorophenol at CoHCF modified electrodes . This paper reports the electrocatalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid, a typical example of an electrocatalytic reaction, at a CoHCF modified glassy carbon (CoHCF/GC) electrode, and the kinetic processes of the electrocatalytic reaction are explained.\nl-Ascorbic acid (H2A) was purchased from Shanghai Lizhu Dongfeng Biotechnology (Shanghai, PR China) and was used as received without further purification. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Solutions of H2A of the desired concentration were prepared daily. All solutions were prepared with doubly deionized water and deaerated by passing them through high purity nitrogen for 20 min before the electrochemical experiments, and a continuous flow of nitrogen was maintained over the sample solution during experiments.\nThe electrochemical experiments were carried out with an EG&G PAR 273 potentiostat/galvanostat using M270 electrochemical analysis software in a three-electrode cell configuration comprising a PTFE-shrouded glassy carbon (GC) electrode (3 mm in diameter) as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode and a coiled platinum wire as the counter electrode. Rotating disk electrode measurements were carried out with a EG&G PAR M616 disk electrode system using a GC disk electrode (4 mm in diameter). The working electrode was polished with metallographic abrasive paper (no. 6, Shanghai, China) first, then with progressively finer slurries of 1, 0.3, and 0.05 \u03bcm alumina powder to a mirror finish. After thorough rinsing, the electrode was cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner for about 15 min, first with ethanol and finally with distilled water, to eliminate any trace of alumina.\nThe experimental temperature was controlled to 25\u00b10.1\u00b0C with a Type 501 thermostat (Shanghai, China)\nThe CoHCF film was formed electrochemically on the surface of the GC electrode in a manner similar to that previously described . The GC electrode was scanned from \u22120.5 to \u22121.15 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s\u22121 in 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 solution containing 1.0\u00d710\u22123 mol dm\u22123 Co(NO3)2, and kept at a potential of \u22121.15 V for a certain period of time for the deposition of cobalt. After removal from the solution and thorough rinsing with water, the electrode was dipped into a 0.2 mol dm\u22123 NaOAc+HOAc buffer solution (pH 4.7) containing 2.0\u00d710\u22123 mol dm\u22123 K3Fe(CN)6, and scanned from \u22120.8 to +0.4 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s\u22121. Finally, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water, and transferred into the phosphate buffer solution to characterise its electrochemical behaviour and examine the electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of H2A.\nThe electrochemical responses of the CoHCF/GC electrode (see Fig. 1 ), which was formed as above, were those anticipated for a surface-confined redox couple, because the peak currents were directly proportional to the scan rates. The surface coverage of CoHCF is dependent on the deposition time and can be controlled. Surface coverage, \u0393, can be calculated with the equation: \u0393=Q/nFA where Q is the charge consumed, obtained from integrating the peak area in cyclic voltammograms under the background correction, n is the number of electrons consumed in the unit electrode reaction (n=1 in the present case) and the other symbols have their usual meaning. Although the surface of the glassy carbon electrode is microscopically rough, it is difficult to estimate the roughness factors, so in all calculations, we have employed the geometric area. Thus, the values reported represent upper limits. In order to maintain constant coverage of CoHCF throughout the experiments, the typical deposition time is 45 s. This deposition time is responsible for a typical value of 8.6\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122 for \u0393 (obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121). Modification of the electrodes was carried out by employing identical solution compositions for obtaining reproducible results.\nFig. 1 shows the cyclic voltammograms of a CoHCF/GC electrode at various scan rates in a 0.025 mol dm\u22123 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte in the absence of any electroactive material in solution. An important feature of the cyclic voltammetric responses of CoHCF/GC electrode is that the system undergoes double reduction and double oxidation at low scan rate (<20 mV s\u22121, Fig. 1, curves a\u2013c). The formal potential, E\u00b0\u2032, which was taken as the midpoint of the anodic and cathodic peak potential, is 480 and 645 mV for redox couples I and II, respectively, at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Increasing the scan rate, the values of E\u00b0\u2032 for couples I and II shift to the positive and negative direction, respectively; for example, these values changed to 490 and 637.5 mV for couples I and II, respectively, at a scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121. The peak-to-peak potential separation was small, although not zero. The deviation of the experimental peak separation from the theoretical value probably arises from: (i) chemical interaction between the ions and the modified film; (ii) electrostatic factors; (iii) polarizabilities of the cation influencing its penetration in and out of the CoHCF film; and (iv) non-equivalent sites in the CoHCF film. However, at high scan rates (\u226550 mV s\u22121), the two anodic peaks merged into one (Fig. 1, curves d\u2013f). The two redox couples occurring at low scan rate can be explained, as proposed by Kulesza and coworkers , by assuming the existence of two possible stoichiometries of CoHCF, namely K2CoIIFeII(CN)6 and KCo1.5 IIFeII(CN)6. Such a system was postulated to be formed during formation of CoHCF films. The following redox reaction are expected: Co1.5IIFeIII(CN)6+e\u2212+K+=KCo1.5IIFeII(CN)6 KCoIIFeIII(CN)6+e\u2212+K+=K2CoIIFeII(CN)6 The film is doped with alkali-metal ions to provide charge neutrality within the film and a net diffusion of ions in and out of the film takes place when the redox state of the film is changed. The insertion of a countercation into the film during reduction and its exclusion upon oxidation, was verified by Kulesza and coworkers using the EQCM method in the case of CoHCF and nickel hexacyanoferrate . It is likely that the KCo1.5 IIFeII(CN)6 form, which is less strongly paired with potassium cations, is responsible for the appearance of a set of peaks at less positive potentials.\nThe effect of solution pH on the electrochemical behaviour of the CoHCF/GC electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in 0.025 mol dm\u22123 phosphate buffer solution at various pH values containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetric results (not shown here) indicated that the electrochemical responses of the CoHCF/GC electrode were not affected by the solution pH in the pH range 4\u201310. The peak potentials and heights remained unchanged. The E\u00b0\u2032 for CoHCF film was independent of the solution pH in the range 4\u201310.\nThe stability of the CoHCF/GC electrode was examined by repetitive scans at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121. In the first few scans, the peak currents decreased on continuous scanning and the peak currents remained at 95% of the value of the first cycle after 5 min repetitive scanning (about 13 cycles). The currents remained at 90% of that for the first cycle after 50 min continuous scanning (about 125 cycles), then, almost no changes in height and separation of cyclic voltammetric peaks were observed after 110 min repetitive scans (about 275 cycles). In addition, the CoHCF/GC electrode can withstand being exposed in air or being stored in solution for a period of time (at least one week) and the peak height and the separation of the peak potentials remain unchanged.\nThe voltammetric responses of a CoHCF/GC electrode were also affected by the concentrations of supporting electrolyte. Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of a CoHCF/GC electrode in three different concentrations of KNO3 (pH 7.0). With a decrease of the concentration of electrolyte, the redox peak potentials shifted in the negative direction. The dependence of the peak potential (E p), the separation of the peaks potential (\u0394E p) and the formal potential (E\u00b0\u2032) on the concentration of supporting electrolyte are shown in Table 1 .\nFig. 3 shows the effects of alkali metal cations on the voltammetric behaviour of a CoHCF/GC electrode. From the cyclic voltammograms, one can find that the CoHCF/GC electrode showed well-defined redox peaks in K+-containing supporting electrolyte solution. In Na+-containing supporting electrolyte, only one pair of broad redox peaks was observed, the peak currents decreased drastically, and in Li+-containing supporting electrolyte, no obvious redox peak can be observed. It is already known that metallocyanate films exhibit electrolyte cation-dependent voltammetric shapes. In studies of the electrochemistry of Prussian blue with various electrolyte cations, Lundgren and Murray also observed different voltammetric behaviour of Prussian blue in XCl (X=Li+, Na+, K+, \u2026) electrolyte. The Prussian blue exhibited a pair of very sharp redox peaks in the case of the K+ electrolyte; the redox peaks became somewhat broad in the Na+ electrolyte. But in the case of Li+ electrolyte, almost no redox peaks were observed at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121; only at the very low scan rate (2 mV s\u22121), could an unstable voltammetric wave be observed in the first cycle. The dependence of CoHCF voltammetric behaviour on the countercation in the present case is similar to that observed by Lundgren and Murray in the case of Prussian blue.\nAn explanation of the dependence of the system's behaviour on alkali-metal cations can be attempted by considering the size of a hydrated countercation. CoHCF film has a face-centred cubic lattice crystal structure, Co(II) and Fe(II) or Fe(III), bridged by a CN\u2212 group, appearing alternatively at the sites of small cubes . Owing to the rigidity of the crystal lattice of the CoHCF film, the diffusion of cobalt ions in it, is very difficult. Only counterions, such as K+, etc., are transported through the CoHCF film during the electrochemical redox process in order to maintain electroneutrality. It is likely that alkali metal countercations do not retain a complete hydration shell upon entrance to the crystal lattice because the cavity radius for CoCHF is 0.18 nm , the diameters for hydrated cations of Li+, Na+ and K+ are 0.42, 0.36 and 0.24 nm, respectively. The countercations must undergo a partial dehydration in order for them to be of the appropriate size to enter the crystal lattice. The partial dehydration of countercations upon entrance to the crystal lattice was demonstrated by the EQCM data of Kulesza et al. . The extent of dehydration for a given cation is determined by its hydration energy. The higher the hydration energy means the more difficult is the dehydration. The hydration energy in volts, calculated from Gibbs energy of hydration values, for Li+, Na+ and K+ is 5.07, 4.08 and 3.34, respectively . From the value of the hydration energy, one can conclude that the hydrated Li+ undergoes the smallest extent of dehydration among the above three cations. The CoHCF may not be capable of incorporating well the fairly large hydrated Li+ cations, and the film is likely to undergo a structural reorganization to form the non-electroactive counterion-free Co2 IIFeII(CN)6 or its solid solution. The CoHCF film seems to possess greater selectivity for the K+ ion as a counterion. The electrochemical behaviour of CoHCF film was also investigated in ammonium nitrate or rubidium nitrate. The surface activity (height of voltammetric peaks) was lost after the electrode was cycled in NH4NO3 or RbNO3 for a few cycles (typically 2\u20133 cycles). The electrode failed to regain its activity in KNO3 solution after cycling in NH4NO3 or RbNO3 because of the solubility of the ammonium- or rubidium-substituted cobalt analogue. Similar results were also observed by Joseph and coworkers .\nTo test the electrocatalytic activity of the CoHCF/GC electrode toward H2A oxidation, cyclic voltammetric responses were obtained in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte in the absence and presence of H2A. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . In the absence of H2A (curve a), a pair of well-defined redox peaks for the CoHCF on the electrode surface can be observed. On addition of 5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123 H2A, there was a drastic enhancement of the anodic current, and simultaneously, the cathodic current decreased greatly (curve b). This behaviour is consistent with a very strong electrocatalytic effect.\nThe cyclic voltammograms of CoHCF/GC electrode at various scan rates obtained in buffer solution (pH 7.0) containing 5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123 H2A indicate that the anodic peak potential for H2A oxidation shifts slightly in the positive direction with increasing scan rate. The shift of anodic peak potential suggests the existence of a kinetic limitation in the reaction between the CoHCF and H2A. The effects of scan rates on the anodic current for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A are summarized in Table 2 . In the scan-rate range 10\u2013500 mV s\u22121, the current function I pa v \u22121/2 is nearly independent of scan rate, v, changing by about 13%, which indicates that the current is limited mostly by the diffusion of H2A to the electrode surface.\nTable 3 shows the effects of the surface coverage, \u0393, of CoHCF on the GC electrode surface, on the anodic peak current, I pa, for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A. Here, \u0393 has been determined using the method described in Eq. (1). This value is a measure of the number of catalytic centres on the GC electrode surface and thus of the thickness of the CoHCF film. A value of (6.0\u20139.8)\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122 appears to be optimal for electrocatalysis. Markedly thinner or thicker films yield lower anodic peak currents for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A. The thinner films probably do not offer enough catalytic sites to handle the available supply of H2A, while the thicker ones seem to suffer from a resistive barrier to the delivery of electrons to the catalytic sites. Based on these results and to ensure that the electrocatalytic current for H2A oxidation at a CoHCF/GC electrode was independent of \u0393, a deposition time of 45 s, which corresponded to \u0393 of 8.6\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122, was employed in the experiments.\nThe stability of electrocatalytic activity of the CoHCF/GC electrode toward H2A oxidation was tested by repetitive scanning of the electrode in buffer solution (pH 7.0) containing 5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123 H2A. At initial cycles (about five cycles), the electrocatalytic currents decrease quickly with increasing scanning number, then the currents change slowly. After about eight cycles, the electrocatalytic currents reach a relatively stable value, remain ca. 80% of the first cycle, and then no visible changes can be detected. Further experimental results indicated that the stability of the CoHCF/GC electrode for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A can be improved but the anodic peak height decreases remarkably when the CoHCF/GC electrode is conditioned at a potential of 0 V or a more negative potential for 30 s.\nWe have carried out rotating disk electrode experiments, by sweeping the potential of the CoHCF/GC electrode at 2 mV s\u22121 in 0.025 mol dm\u22123 phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte in the presence of H2A, to obtain the kinetic parameters for the electrooxidation of H2A. For a given rotational speed, the electrocatalytic current has a linear relationship to the concentration of H2A in the concentration range 5.0\u00d710\u22125\u201312\u00d710\u22122 mol dm\u22123. For the given concentration of H2A (5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123), plots of electrocatalytic currents, I lim, versus \u03c9 1/2 were found to be non-linear, which suggests that the reaction is limited by kinetics and not by transport. The electrocatalytic currents of H2A increase linearly with increasing rotational speed at low rotation rates and the limiting electrocatalytic current approaches independence of the rotation rate as it is increased. The shape of the curve for electrocatalytic current versus \u03c9 1/2, points to an electrocatalytic reaction scheme for H2A oxidation on the CoHCF/GC electrode, similar to that depicted by Oyama and Anson in the case of the oxidation of Fe2+ catalysed by IrCl6 2\u2212 incorporated in a protonated PVP coating on the electrode surface. At low rotation rates, the transfer of H2A through the rather thick Levich layer controls the current so that linear I lim versus \u03c9 1/2 behaviour results. At higher values of \u03c9, the thickness of the Levich layer decreases and the magnitude of the current is controlled by the rate of the redox reaction between H2A and the CoHCF film. The situation is analogous to that encountered when a homogeneous redox reaction between an electrogenerated reagent and an electroinactive substrate controls the current at a rotating disk electrode. Such cases are conveniently analysed by means of plots of I lim \u22121 versus \u03c9 \u22121/2 . Fig. 5 presents examples of the plots.\nThe linearity of the plots in Fig. 5 indicates that the system follows the equation : Ilim\u22121=Ilev\u22121+Ikin\u22121 where I lim is the measured limited electrocatalytic current and I lev, given by the expression, Ilev=0.62nFAD2/3\u03c91/2\u03bd\u22121/6c* is the Levich current representing the mass transport of H2A in the solution and I kin, the kinetic current corresponding to the electron cross-exchange between H2A and the CoHCF redox site, is given by the equation Ikin=nFAk\u0393c* for reactions that are first-order with respect to both the bulk concentration of H2A, c*, and the surface concentrations of CoHCF on the GC electrode surface, \u0393 (\u0393=8.6\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122 in our rotating disk electrode experiments). k is the rate constant governing the electrocatalytic reaction between H2A and CoHCF, D is the diffusion coefficient of H2A in solution. A value of 5.7\u00d710\u22126 cm2 s\u22121 for D is adopted in the presence case, as determined using chronoamperometry and rotation disk electrode measurements, and all other parameters have their usual meaning. Both the slopes and intercepts of the lines in Fig. 5 are inversely proportional to bulk concentrations of H2A in accord with Eqs. (4)\u2013(6), suggesting the currents are controlled by the rate of a catalytic redox reaction between CoHCF and H2A . This would not be true if the electron transfer reaction between the GC electrode surface and the CoHCF controlled the current. Plots with a common intercept would result in this case because the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (4) would be independent of the bulk concentration of H2A. The average value of k\u0393 calculated from the intercepts of the plots is 1.89\u00d710\u22122 cm s\u22121 corresponding to a moderate intrinsic rate of heterogenous charge transfer.\nThe cyclic voltammograms of the CoHCF modified glassy carbon (CoHCF/GC) electrode show the presence of two pairs of well-defined redox peaks at low scan rate while the two anodic peaks merge to one at high scan rates. The voltammetric responses of the CoHCF/GC electrode were affected by the concentration of supporting electrolyte and the counter cations. The CoHCF/GC shows high electrocatalytic activity toward ascorbic acid oxidation. The electrocatalytic reaction rate constant between H2A and CoHCF was determined using rotating disk electrode measurements.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Inorganic modified electrodes are widely used in many areas, such as electroanalysis and site-selective electrocatalysis , electrochromic devices , electrochemical power sources and materials science , photocurrent response studies , protection against corrosion , and interfacial charge and electron transfer , etc. Since the pioneering work of Neff and Itaya et al. on Prussian blue modified electrodes, various inorganic materials such as clays , zeolites , transition metal oxides , metal phthalocyanines , metal porphyrins , transition metal particles , polyoxo-metallate and polynuclear transition metal cyanides have been used to fabricate inorganic film modified electrodes. Of these, the transition metal hexacyanoferrate has received much attention. Considering the wide scope of electrochemical studies and their possible exploitation, attention is currently being paid to the preparation of a number of analogues of Prussian blue as revealed by the growing number of references on this subject . On careful examination of different reports on metal hexacyanoferrate-modified electrodes and their redox characteristics published so far, it is apparent that only a few have been found to be as successful as Prussian blue from the viewpoint of the varied applications listed above, perhaps due to the absence of the characteristics and reversible redox centres referred to in the case of Prussian blue. Among the many metal hexacyanoferrates, cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) is exceptional; it exhibits excellent reversible redox centres very similar to those of Prussian blue.\nElectrodes modified with CoHCF have been prepared recently where two different types of film were reported . One type has a redox couple and the other has two redox couples . Studies concerning the structural aspects of CoHCF and its magnetic properties were recently reported by Kulesza et al. and Sato et al. , respectively. Using voltammetry, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments, Kulesza et al. indicated that CoHCF has a rigid, cubic-type, zeolite structure composed of three orthogonal Fe\ue5f8C\ue606N\ue5f8Co chains in which both metals (Fe and Co) are octahedrally coordinated by six carbons and six nitrogens. The chemical environment of Co(II) in CoHCF, particularly the Co\ue5f8N bond lengths, is dependent on the nature and size of the alkali metal countercations, accommodated in the CoHCF structure. Sato et al. demonstrated that the cobalt iron cyanide thin film (about 0.5\u20130.1 \u03bcm thick), which was synthesized electrochemically on a platinum electrode under potentiostatic conditions at \u22120.4 V (vs. SCE) in aqueous solution, behaves as if it contained molecular magnets that exhibit long-time magnetic ordering or bistability with hysteresis. But the application of CoHCF modified electrodes has not been exploited very much. Green-Pedersen and Korshin studied the possibility of using the CoHCF modified graphic electrode to separate and transfer Cs+ from high sodium waters. Their results indicated that a thin layer of CoHCF was highly selective to Cs+ in the presence of overwhelmingly higher concentrations of Na+ and K+. Cs+ was incorporated into the electrode at 0 V and expelled at +1.0 V. Only a few papers have reported electrocatalytic reactions at the CoHCF film modified electrode; for example, we have reported the electrocatalytic activity of a CoHCF modified glassy carbon electrode toward NADH oxidation and other authors have reported electrocatalytic oxidation of hydroxylamine, nitrite, thiosulfate, hydrazine and p-chlorophenol at CoHCF modified electrodes . This paper reports the electrocatalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid, a typical example of an electrocatalytic reaction, at a CoHCF modified glassy carbon (CoHCF/GC) electrode, and the kinetic processes of the electrocatalytic reaction are explained.\nl-Ascorbic acid (H2A) was purchased from Shanghai Lizhu Dongfeng Biotechnology (Shanghai, PR China) and was used as received without further purification. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Solutions of H2A of the desired concentration were prepared daily. All solutions were prepared with doubly deionized water and deaerated by passing them through high purity nitrogen for 20 min before the electrochemical experiments, and a continuous flow of nitrogen was maintained over the sample solution during experiments.\nThe electrochemical experiments were carried out with an EG&G PAR 273 potentiostat/galvanostat using M270 electrochemical analysis software in a three-electrode cell configuration comprising a PTFE-shrouded glassy carbon (GC) electrode (3 mm in diameter) as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode and a coiled platinum wire as the counter electrode. Rotating disk electrode measurements were carried out with a EG&G PAR M616 disk electrode system using a GC disk electrode (4 mm in diameter). The working electrode was polished with metallographic abrasive paper (no. 6, Shanghai, China) first, then with progressively finer slurries of 1, 0.3, and 0.05 \u03bcm alumina powder to a mirror finish. After thorough rinsing, the electrode was cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner for about 15 min, first with ethanol and finally with distilled water, to eliminate any trace of alumina.\nThe experimental temperature was controlled to 25\u00b10.1\u00b0C with a Type 501 thermostat (Shanghai, China)\nThe CoHCF film was formed electrochemically on the surface of the GC electrode in a manner similar to that previously described . The GC electrode was scanned from \u22120.5 to \u22121.15 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s\u22121 in 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 solution containing 1.0\u00d710\u22123 mol dm\u22123 Co(NO3)2, and kept at a potential of \u22121.15 V for a certain period of time for the deposition of cobalt. After removal from the solution and thorough rinsing with water, the electrode was dipped into a 0.2 mol dm\u22123 NaOAc+HOAc buffer solution (pH 4.7) containing 2.0\u00d710\u22123 mol dm\u22123 K3Fe(CN)6, and scanned from \u22120.8 to +0.4 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s\u22121. Finally, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water, and transferred into the phosphate buffer solution to characterise its electrochemical behaviour and examine the electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of H2A.\nThe electrochemical responses of the CoHCF/GC electrode (see Fig. 1 ), which was formed as above, were those anticipated for a surface-confined redox couple, because the peak currents were directly proportional to the scan rates. The surface coverage of CoHCF is dependent on the deposition time and can be controlled. Surface coverage, \u0393, can be calculated with the equation: \u0393=Q/nFA where Q is the charge consumed, obtained from integrating the peak area in cyclic voltammograms under the background correction, n is the number of electrons consumed in the unit electrode reaction (n=1 in the present case) and the other symbols have their usual meaning. Although the surface of the glassy carbon electrode is microscopically rough, it is difficult to estimate the roughness factors, so in all calculations, we have employed the geometric area. Thus, the values reported represent upper limits. In order to maintain constant coverage of CoHCF throughout the experiments, the typical deposition time is 45 s. This deposition time is responsible for a typical value of 8.6\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122 for \u0393 (obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121). Modification of the electrodes was carried out by employing identical solution compositions for obtaining reproducible results.\nFig. 1 shows the cyclic voltammograms of a CoHCF/GC electrode at various scan rates in a 0.025 mol dm\u22123 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte in the absence of any electroactive material in solution. An important feature of the cyclic voltammetric responses of CoHCF/GC electrode is that the system undergoes double reduction and double oxidation at low scan rate (<20 mV s\u22121, Fig. 1, curves a\u2013c). The formal potential, E\u00b0\u2032, which was taken as the midpoint of the anodic and cathodic peak potential, is 480 and 645 mV for redox couples I and II, respectively, at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Increasing the scan rate, the values of E\u00b0\u2032 for couples I and II shift to the positive and negative direction, respectively; for example, these values changed to 490 and 637.5 mV for couples I and II, respectively, at a scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121. The peak-to-peak potential separation was small, although not zero. The deviation of the experimental peak separation from the theoretical value probably arises from: (i) chemical interaction between the ions and the modified film; (ii) electrostatic factors; (iii) polarizabilities of the cation influencing its penetration in and out of the CoHCF film; and (iv) non-equivalent sites in the CoHCF film. However, at high scan rates (\u226550 mV s\u22121), the two anodic peaks merged into one (Fig. 1, curves d\u2013f). The two redox couples occurring at low scan rate can be explained, as proposed by Kulesza and coworkers , by assuming the existence of two possible stoichiometries of CoHCF, namely K2CoIIFeII(CN)6 and KCo1.5 IIFeII(CN)6. Such a system was postulated to be formed during formation of CoHCF films. The following redox reaction are expected: Co1.5IIFeIII(CN)6+e\u2212+K+=KCo1.5IIFeII(CN)6 KCoIIFeIII(CN)6+e\u2212+K+=K2CoIIFeII(CN)6 The film is doped with alkali-metal ions to provide charge neutrality within the film and a net diffusion of ions in and out of the film takes place when the redox state of the film is changed. The insertion of a countercation into the film during reduction and its exclusion upon oxidation, was verified by Kulesza and coworkers using the EQCM method in the case of CoHCF and nickel hexacyanoferrate . It is likely that the KCo1.5 IIFeII(CN)6 form, which is less strongly paired with potassium cations, is responsible for the appearance of a set of peaks at less positive potentials.\nThe effect of solution pH on the electrochemical behaviour of the CoHCF/GC electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in 0.025 mol dm\u22123 phosphate buffer solution at various pH values containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetric results (not shown here) indicated that the electrochemical responses of the CoHCF/GC electrode were not affected by the solution pH in the pH range 4\u201310. The peak potentials and heights remained unchanged. The E\u00b0\u2032 for CoHCF film was independent of the solution pH in the range 4\u201310.\nThe stability of the CoHCF/GC electrode was examined by repetitive scans at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121. In the first few scans, the peak currents decreased on continuous scanning and the peak currents remained at 95% of the value of the first cycle after 5 min repetitive scanning (about 13 cycles). The currents remained at 90% of that for the first cycle after 50 min continuous scanning (about 125 cycles), then, almost no changes in height and separation of cyclic voltammetric peaks were observed after 110 min repetitive scans (about 275 cycles). In addition, the CoHCF/GC electrode can withstand being exposed in air or being stored in solution for a period of time (at least one week) and the peak height and the separation of the peak potentials remain unchanged.\nThe voltammetric responses of a CoHCF/GC electrode were also affected by the concentrations of supporting electrolyte. Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of a CoHCF/GC electrode in three different concentrations of KNO3 (pH 7.0). With a decrease of the concentration of electrolyte, the redox peak potentials shifted in the negative direction. The dependence of the peak potential (E p), the separation of the peaks potential (\u0394E p) and the formal potential (E\u00b0\u2032) on the concentration of supporting electrolyte are shown in Table 1 .\nFig. 3 shows the effects of alkali metal cations on the voltammetric behaviour of a CoHCF/GC electrode. From the cyclic voltammograms, one can find that the CoHCF/GC electrode showed well-defined redox peaks in K+-containing supporting electrolyte solution. In Na+-containing supporting electrolyte, only one pair of broad redox peaks was observed, the peak currents decreased drastically, and in Li+-containing supporting electrolyte, no obvious redox peak can be observed. It is already known that metallocyanate films exhibit electrolyte cation-dependent voltammetric shapes. In studies of the electrochemistry of Prussian blue with various electrolyte cations, Lundgren and Murray also observed different voltammetric behaviour of Prussian blue in XCl (X=Li+, Na+, K+, \u2026) electrolyte. The Prussian blue exhibited a pair of very sharp redox peaks in the case of the K+ electrolyte; the redox peaks became somewhat broad in the Na+ electrolyte. But in the case of Li+ electrolyte, almost no redox peaks were observed at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121; only at the very low scan rate (2 mV s\u22121), could an unstable voltammetric wave be observed in the first cycle. The dependence of CoHCF voltammetric behaviour on the countercation in the present case is similar to that observed by Lundgren and Murray in the case of Prussian blue.\nAn explanation of the dependence of the system's behaviour on alkali-metal cations can be attempted by considering the size of a hydrated countercation. CoHCF film has a face-centred cubic lattice crystal structure, Co(II) and Fe(II) or Fe(III), bridged by a CN\u2212 group, appearing alternatively at the sites of small cubes . Owing to the rigidity of the crystal lattice of the CoHCF film, the diffusion of cobalt ions in it, is very difficult. Only counterions, such as K+, etc., are transported through the CoHCF film during the electrochemical redox process in order to maintain electroneutrality. It is likely that alkali metal countercations do not retain a complete hydration shell upon entrance to the crystal lattice because the cavity radius for CoCHF is 0.18 nm , the diameters for hydrated cations of Li+, Na+ and K+ are 0.42, 0.36 and 0.24 nm, respectively. The countercations must undergo a partial dehydration in order for them to be of the appropriate size to enter the crystal lattice. The partial dehydration of countercations upon entrance to the crystal lattice was demonstrated by the EQCM data of Kulesza et al. . The extent of dehydration for a given cation is determined by its hydration energy. The higher the hydration energy means the more difficult is the dehydration. The hydration energy in volts, calculated from Gibbs energy of hydration values, for Li+, Na+ and K+ is 5.07, 4.08 and 3.34, respectively . From the value of the hydration energy, one can conclude that the hydrated Li+ undergoes the smallest extent of dehydration among the above three cations. The CoHCF may not be capable of incorporating well the fairly large hydrated Li+ cations, and the film is likely to undergo a structural reorganization to form the non-electroactive counterion-free Co2 IIFeII(CN)6 or its solid solution. The CoHCF film seems to possess greater selectivity for the K+ ion as a counterion. The electrochemical behaviour of CoHCF film was also investigated in ammonium nitrate or rubidium nitrate. The surface activity (height of voltammetric peaks) was lost after the electrode was cycled in NH4NO3 or RbNO3 for a few cycles (typically 2\u20133 cycles). The electrode failed to regain its activity in KNO3 solution after cycling in NH4NO3 or RbNO3 because of the solubility of the ammonium- or rubidium-substituted cobalt analogue. Similar results were also observed by Joseph and coworkers .\nTo test the electrocatalytic activity of the CoHCF/GC electrode toward H2A oxidation, cyclic voltammetric responses were obtained in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte in the absence and presence of H2A. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . In the absence of H2A (curve a), a pair of well-defined redox peaks for the CoHCF on the electrode surface can be observed. On addition of 5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123 H2A, there was a drastic enhancement of the anodic current, and simultaneously, the cathodic current decreased greatly (curve b). This behaviour is consistent with a very strong electrocatalytic effect.\nThe cyclic voltammograms of CoHCF/GC electrode at various scan rates obtained in buffer solution (pH 7.0) containing 5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123 H2A indicate that the anodic peak potential for H2A oxidation shifts slightly in the positive direction with increasing scan rate. The shift of anodic peak potential suggests the existence of a kinetic limitation in the reaction between the CoHCF and H2A. The effects of scan rates on the anodic current for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A are summarized in Table 2 . In the scan-rate range 10\u2013500 mV s\u22121, the current function I pa v \u22121/2 is nearly independent of scan rate, v, changing by about 13%, which indicates that the current is limited mostly by the diffusion of H2A to the electrode surface.\nTable 3 shows the effects of the surface coverage, \u0393, of CoHCF on the GC electrode surface, on the anodic peak current, I pa, for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A. Here, \u0393 has been determined using the method described in Eq. (1). This value is a measure of the number of catalytic centres on the GC electrode surface and thus of the thickness of the CoHCF film. A value of (6.0\u20139.8)\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122 appears to be optimal for electrocatalysis. Markedly thinner or thicker films yield lower anodic peak currents for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A. The thinner films probably do not offer enough catalytic sites to handle the available supply of H2A, while the thicker ones seem to suffer from a resistive barrier to the delivery of electrons to the catalytic sites. Based on these results and to ensure that the electrocatalytic current for H2A oxidation at a CoHCF/GC electrode was independent of \u0393, a deposition time of 45 s, which corresponded to \u0393 of 8.6\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122, was employed in the experiments.\nThe stability of electrocatalytic activity of the CoHCF/GC electrode toward H2A oxidation was tested by repetitive scanning of the electrode in buffer solution (pH 7.0) containing 5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123 H2A. At initial cycles (about five cycles), the electrocatalytic currents decrease quickly with increasing scanning number, then the currents change slowly. After about eight cycles, the electrocatalytic currents reach a relatively stable value, remain ca. 80% of the first cycle, and then no visible changes can be detected. Further experimental results indicated that the stability of the CoHCF/GC electrode for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2A can be improved but the anodic peak height decreases remarkably when the CoHCF/GC electrode is conditioned at a potential of 0 V or a more negative potential for 30 s.\nWe have carried out rotating disk electrode experiments, by sweeping the potential of the CoHCF/GC electrode at 2 mV s\u22121 in 0.025 mol dm\u22123 phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KNO3 as supporting electrolyte in the presence of H2A, to obtain the kinetic parameters for the electrooxidation of H2A. For a given rotational speed, the electrocatalytic current has a linear relationship to the concentration of H2A in the concentration range 5.0\u00d710\u22125\u201312\u00d710\u22122 mol dm\u22123. For the given concentration of H2A (5.0\u00d710\u22124 mol dm\u22123), plots of electrocatalytic currents, I lim, versus \u03c9 1/2 were found to be non-linear, which suggests that the reaction is limited by kinetics and not by transport. The electrocatalytic currents of H2A increase linearly with increasing rotational speed at low rotation rates and the limiting electrocatalytic current approaches independence of the rotation rate as it is increased. The shape of the curve for electrocatalytic current versus \u03c9 1/2, points to an electrocatalytic reaction scheme for H2A oxidation on the CoHCF/GC electrode, similar to that depicted by Oyama and Anson in the case of the oxidation of Fe2+ catalysed by IrCl6 2\u2212 incorporated in a protonated PVP coating on the electrode surface. At low rotation rates, the transfer of H2A through the rather thick Levich layer controls the current so that linear I lim versus \u03c9 1/2 behaviour results. At higher values of \u03c9, the thickness of the Levich layer decreases and the magnitude of the current is controlled by the rate of the redox reaction between H2A and the CoHCF film. The situation is analogous to that encountered when a homogeneous redox reaction between an electrogenerated reagent and an electroinactive substrate controls the current at a rotating disk electrode. Such cases are conveniently analysed by means of plots of I lim \u22121 versus \u03c9 \u22121/2 . Fig. 5 presents examples of the plots.\nThe linearity of the plots in Fig. 5 indicates that the system follows the equation : Ilim\u22121=Ilev\u22121+Ikin\u22121 where I lim is the measured limited electrocatalytic current and I lev, given by the expression, Ilev=0.62nFAD2/3\u03c91/2\u03bd\u22121/6c* is the Levich current representing the mass transport of H2A in the solution and I kin, the kinetic current corresponding to the electron cross-exchange between H2A and the CoHCF redox site, is given by the equation Ikin=nFAk\u0393c* for reactions that are first-order with respect to both the bulk concentration of H2A, c*, and the surface concentrations of CoHCF on the GC electrode surface, \u0393 (\u0393=8.6\u00d710\u22128 mol cm\u22122 in our rotating disk electrode experiments). k is the rate constant governing the electrocatalytic reaction between H2A and CoHCF, D is the diffusion coefficient of H2A in solution. A value of 5.7\u00d710\u22126 cm2 s\u22121 for D is adopted in the presence case, as determined using chronoamperometry and rotation disk electrode measurements, and all other parameters have their usual meaning. Both the slopes and intercepts of the lines in Fig. 5 are inversely proportional to bulk concentrations of H2A in accord with Eqs. (4)\u2013(6), suggesting the currents are controlled by the rate of a catalytic redox reaction between CoHCF and H2A . This would not be true if the electron transfer reaction between the GC electrode surface and the CoHCF controlled the current. Plots with a common intercept would result in this case because the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (4) would be independent of the bulk concentration of H2A. The average value of k\u0393 calculated from the intercepts of the plots is 1.89\u00d710\u22122 cm s\u22121 corresponding to a moderate intrinsic rate of heterogenous charge transfer.\nThe cyclic voltammograms of the CoHCF modified glassy carbon (CoHCF/GC) electrode show the presence of two pairs of well-defined redox peaks at low scan rate while the two anodic peaks merge to one at high scan rates. The voltammetric responses of the CoHCF/GC electrode were affected by the concentration of supporting electrolyte and the counter cations. The CoHCF/GC shows high electrocatalytic activity toward ascorbic acid oxidation. The electrocatalytic reaction rate constant between H2A and CoHCF was determined using rotating disk electrode measurements."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nSerum albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulatory system. The most important physiological function of serum albumin is to maintain the osmotic pressure and pH of blood , and transport a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds including fatty acids, metal, amino acids, steroids and drugs . Because of these extraordinary characteristics, albumins from various sources have gained extensive biomedical and industrial applications as well as research interest. The crystal structure of human serum albumin (HSA) has been determined and the interaction with fatty acids has been studied for HSA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) . Although the conformation of BSA is thought to be similar to HSA due to 76% of amino acid sequence homology, the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of BSA has yet to be characterized.\nThe biological function of a protein depends on its conformation. The most informative method to study the 3-D structure of proteins is X-ray crystallography. The X-ray crystallography, which provides information regarding the atomic distances of a crystallized compound, is not always applicable because not all proteins can be readily crystallized. In addition, proteins rarely exist as crystals under physiological conditions, but are soluble in cytosol or associated with the membrane or other components of the cell. A native biochemical condition is often required to maintain an optimal biological activity of proteins. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can generate the tertiary structural information of proteins in solution, and therefore, complementing X-ray crystallography. However, both techniques require large amount of samples, imposing limitations in many biological settings.\nOver the past years mass spectrometry, in conjunction with chemical cross-linking, has emerged as a sensitive tool for probing the tertiary structure of proteins . A protein is modified covalently by bi-functional cross-linking reagents, followed by proteolytic digestion. Cross-linked peptides are analyzed by mass spectrometry to assign the amino acid residues participating in the cross-linking. The maximum distance between the cross-linked residues is dependent on the cross-linker arm length. This information generates the intramolecular distance constraints, assisting computational method to determine the 3-D atomic arrangement of a protein. The approach is rapid and requires small amounts of proteins with no limitation on the size of the molecule. In addition, the method can be applied in native biochemical conditions, showing promises in studying conformational changes of a protein associated with its biological function. Recently, Back et al. has used the O-18 labeled proteolysis to unambiguously recognize the cross-linking between two peptide segments . In the mass spectra of peptides obtained from the cross-linked proteins digested in O-18 water, the through-space cross-linked peptides were distinguished by a characteristic 8 Da mass shift, whereas the non-modified, internally cross-linked or end-capped peptides showed a 4 Da mass shift. The mass shifts rely on the complete incorporation of two O-18 atoms during proteolytic hydrolysis for each C-terminus ending with either lysine or arginine .\nIn this study, we probe the conformation of BSA by mass spectrometry, combined with lysine-specific cross-linking and tryptic digestion. To generate information about the distance constraints for BSA, which contains 60 lysines as well as many hydrophobic pockets, we used three different lysine-specific cross-linkers of varying spacer arm lengths and hydrophobicity (Figure 1). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, (BS3), a water-soluble chemical cross-linker with a spacer arm length of 11.4 \u00c5, was chosen to generate information of the lysine\u2013lysine distance constraints for the lysines in the hydrophilic or surface regions. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a water-insoluble analog of BS3 whose reactivity and spacer arm length are virtually identical to BS3 , was used in an attempt to generate the cross-linking information for the lysines in the hydrophobic regions. In addition, we used disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), a hydrophobic cross-linker with a shorter spacer arm length (7.7 \u00c5), to further refine the distance constraints between lysine residues in the BSA molecule. Each cross-linked peptide was recognized with the aid of O-18 labeling and characterized by the MS/MS analysis. The distance constraints obtained from the cross-linked lysine residues in BSA were compared with the distance between the corresponding lysine residues in HSA from the crystal structure, wherever such comparison was feasible.\nFatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), and disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Modified trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). O-18 enriched water (99%) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Potassium phosphate was purchased from Mallinckrodt (Phillipsburg, NJ). Pure water was obtained from a Milli-Q UV plus ultra-pure water system (Bedford, MA). Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).\nBSA at 10 \u03bcM in phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was incubated with 500 \u03bcM cross-linkers (prepared freshly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions) at room temperature for 30 min. This condition represents a cross-linker to protein ratio of 50:1. We have also used a cross-linker to protein ratio of 20:1, which is supposed to generate only one cross-linking per molecule [24], and found virtually identical results. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra for the BSA molecules cross-linked under our experimental condition was also identical to that of the non-cross-linked control (data not shown), indicating that no major conformational changes occurred due to cross-linking. The reaction was quenched with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The protein was reduced with dithiothreitol (100 mM) for 1 h at 56 \u00b0C and alkylated with iodoacetamide (100 mM) for 45 min at room temperature. The sample mixture was dialyzed against pure water using a membrane with MW cutoff of 3500 Da (Waters) three times within 24 h. The sample was divided into two equal aliquots which were dried using a vacuum centrifuge. As described by Back , the samples were reconstituted in either pure water or 99% O-18 enriched water containing 5% ACN. The reconstituted mixture was subjected to tryptic digestion at 37 \u00b0C for 20 h with a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:10. Alternatively, after reduction and alkylation, SDS/PAGE was carried out to isolate the intramolecular-crosslinked monomer from the intermolecular-crosslinked multimers. The monomer was subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Under our experimental conditions, the multimeric bands were not observed after visualization with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.\nAfter desalting using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the tryptic peptides were analyzed by a QSTAR pulsar Qq-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Toronto, CA) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. The ion source voltage was set at 1100 V in the positive ion mode. A full mass spectrum was acquired over an m/z range of 500\u20132000, and the ions of interest were subjected to collision-induced dissociation using high purity argon for MS/MS analysis.\nLC-nano-ESI MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap XCT mass spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system. Peptides were separated using a Zorbax 300 SB C18 column (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 150 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Wilmington, DE) using a mobile phase that contained Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mobile phase composition was held initially at 2% B for 3 min and then changed from 2\u201380% B over 80 min. A capillary voltage was set at 1600 V. The mass spectrometer was scanned from 300 to 2000 m/z range.\nThe mass values of tryptic peptides were assigned with the help of the Protein Analysis Work Sheet (PAWS) (ProteoMetrics, NY). The cross-linked tryptic peptide peaks were distinguished by the comparison of the mass spectra obtained from the digests of the non-cross-linked control or cross-linked BSA. The through-space cross-linked peptide peaks were confirmed by the characteristic 8 Da mass shift when digested in O-18 water. The identity of the cross-linked peptides was revealed through the amino acid sequence information obtained using the MS/MS analysis.\nThe 3-D structure of BSA is believed to be very similar to HSA, because the two proteins share 76% sequence identity. Figure 2a shows the crystal structure of HSA and the amino acid sequences of BSA and HSA. The heart-shaped HSA molecule is made up of three homologous \u03b1-helical domains (I, II, III) . Each domain contains two subdomains (A and B) that share common structure motifs. Each domain can be divided into 10 helical segments: for example, h1\u2013h6 for the Subdomain A and h7\u2013h10 for the Subdomain B (Figure 2b). Human serum albumin structure is predominantly \u03b1-helical (67%) with the remaining polypeptide occurring in turns and extended or flexible regions between subdomains, and contains no \u03b2-sheets . The subdomain information is indicated along with the amino acid sequences of BSA and HSA. The distance constraints between lysine residues in BSA obtained in the present study was compared with the distances of the corresponding lysine residues of HSA determined by the crystal structure, if such corresponding residues are present.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the cross-linked peptides can be identified by comparing the mass spectra of tryptic digests obtained from unmodified (3a) and BS3-modified BSA (3b,c). The newly emerging peptide peaks in the spectra from BS3-modified BSA digested with trypsin in O-16 water (3b) or 99% O-18 water (3c) revealed the nature of the cross-linking. With the digestion in O-18 water, the characteristic mass shifts of 8 Da confirmed the through-space cross-linking peptides, whereas the cross-linked peptides within one segment or peptides end-capped with the cross-linker showed 4 Da shift. An example is shown in Figure 3b for a representative through-space cross-linked peptide with a mass value of 2952.5, which was reconstructed from a triply charged ion at m/z 985.2 (inset). In the spectrum of BS3-modified BSA digested in O-18 water (Figure 3c), the corresponding peak appeared at a mass of 2960.5 which was derived from the triply charged ion detected at m/z 987.9. The 8 Da difference in the mass indicated that this peak resulted from through-space cross-linking.\nThe identity of the cross-linked peptides detected as the triply charged ion at m/z 985.2 was determined by the amino acid sequence analyzed by MS/MS, as shown in Figure 4. Clearly, the data revealed that this peak resulted from the through-space cross-linking between the segments A[233\u2013241]R, and L[372\u2013386]K, with K235 from the Subdomain IIA cross-linked to K374 from the Subdomain IIB. Good coverage of y-series ions was observed for both segments. The amide bond cleavages due to the fragmentation of A[233\u2013241]R are labeled with lower case letters, whereas those from L[372\u2013386]K are marked with upper case letters. O-18 labeling during tryptic digestion assisted in distinguishing the C-terminal ions from the N-terminal ions. The y ions from O-18 labeled peptides showed a mass shift of 4 Da in comparison to the corresponding y ions, because these ions contained a single C-terminus. In contrast, b ions were not affected by O-18 labeling as shown for B3 or b3 at m/z 451 as an example. The B3 or b3 ion in this case included C8H12O2 of BS3 with a net mass increase of 138 considering the loss of two hydrogen atoms from the lysine side chains upon cross-linking.\nIn some cases, LC/MS/MS analyses allowed more reliable identification of cross-linked peptides as the separation of the tryptic peptide mixture precedes the mass spectrometric detection. Figure 5 depicts a typical extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) reconstructed for a cross-linked peptide with a molecular weight of 1974 Da. The peptide was detected as triply and quadruply charged ions at m/z 659.0 and 494.5, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 5b, and therefore, these two ions were used to reconstruct the ion chromatogram. This chromatographic peak eluting at 27.8 min was observed in the digests of the BS3-modified BSA, and as expected, was not present in the digest from the unmodified control BSA (Figure 5a). The corresponding chromatographic peak for the O-18 labeled peptides contained the triply charged ion at m/z 661.7 and quadruply charged ion at m/z 496.5, representing a through-space cross-linked peptide with the molecular weight of 1982 (Figure 5c).\nFigure 6 shows the MS/MS spectra for the triply charged ions at m/z 659.0 and 661.7 derived from O-16 and O-18 labeled digests. The fragments detected in the spectra revealed that this peptide resulted from the cross-linking between the segments E[210\u2013218]R and L[242\u2013248]K, with K211 (located in the turn between Subdomain IB and Subdomain IIA) linked to K245 (from Subdomain IIA). The assignment of each fragment was assisted by O-18 labeling. For example, the fragment ion at m/z 1080.6 appeared in both O-16 and O-18 labeled peptide spectra, indicating that it belonged to the N-terminal ions. The singly charged ion of m/z 1225.5 increased 4 mass units in the O-18 trace, implying that this ion contained only one C-terminus. The doubly charged fragment ion of 923.0 shifted to 927.0 for the O-18 labeled peptide, reflecting a mass shift of 8 Da. Therefore, this ion was readily identified as a y-series ion containing both C-termini of the cross-linked segments. For the fragment ions containing both segments the loss of NH3 was commonly observed as shown for y9Y4, y9Y5, y9Y6, b2Y7, and b3Y7 ions. The ion y9Y4 represented the fragment containing y9 from the peptide segment of E[210\u2013218]R and Y4 of the segment L[242\u2013248]K plus C8H12O2 of BS3 (net mass increase of 138). According to the above information, the fragment ions detected in the MS/MS spectra of all the cross-linked peptides were unambiguously assigned. A summary of all the cross-linked and end-capped peptides detected by LC/MS and Qq-TOF is presented in Table 1. Nine through space and four internally cross-linked peptides as well as two end-capped peptides were identified and characterized. The table also lists the distances between the corresponding lysine residues from the crystal structure of HSA molecule as a comparison for the distance constraints obtained in this study.\nFigure 7 depicts representative reconstructed mass spectra of tryptic digests obtained from unmodified control (7a), DSS (7b, c) or DSG-modified BSA (7d, e). The cross-linked BSA was digested in either O-16 or O-18 water. The newly formed cross-linked peptides were identified by Qq-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the digests from the DSS-modified or DSG-modified BSA. An example is shown for a peak with a mass of 3251.5 reconstructed from the quadruply charged ion of m/z 813.9 (inset b), which appeared in the mass spectrum of DSS-modified BSA digested with trypsin in O-16 water. Its mass shifted to 3259.6 (reconstructed from 815.9, inset c) in the corresponding O-18 spectrum, indicating a through-space cross-linking. In the mass spectrum of DSG-modified BSA digested in O-16 water, a new peak with mass of 3209.7 (reconstructed from the quadruply charged ion of m/z 803.4, inset d) was observed. The peak showed an increase of 8 Da in mass (3217.6 Da, reconstructed from 805.4, inset,e) in the corresponding O-18 spectrum. The MS/MS spectrum of the peak with the mass of 3251.5 or 3259.6 (O-16 or O-18) was essentially the same as that from the peak with the mass of 3209.7 or 3217.6 (O-16 or O-18) shown in Figure 8. The MS/MS analyses revealed that the peaks originated from the cross-linking between K235 in helix 2, and K263 of helix 3 in the Subdomain IIA, via C8H12O2 of DSS (net mass increase of 138) or C5H6O2 of DSG (net mass increase of 96), respectively. The LC-MS/MS results were consistent with the data obtained from static nanospray ionization/Qq-TOF analysis. Tables 2 and 3 list all cross-linked and capped peptides that were modified by DSS and DSG, respectively. Using DSS, 12 through-space and 5 internally cross-linked peptides, and 1 end-capped cross-linked peptide were identified. With DSG, 8 through-space and 4 internally cross-linked peptides, and 1 end-capped cross-linked peptide were detected.\nThe cross-linking with BS3 (Table 1) generated three short-span internal cross-linked peptides, which are within 7 amino acids in a segment (K138\u2013K140, K156\u2013K160, and K399\u2013K401). These peptides were of little value in providing the 3-D spatial constraints, because BS3 coupling with two lysines could span up to 7 amino acids . The remaining long-span internal cross-linking between K412 and K420 of the Subdomain IIIA, as well as the 9 through-space lysine cross-linking, should provide valuable information on the distance constraints in the 3-D structure of BSA. Six inter-domain cross-linked pairs (K140 of IA to K455 of IIIA, K228 of IIA to K489 of IIIA, K204 of IB/IIA to K495 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA to K463 of IIIA, K245 of IIA and K463 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA to K245 of IIA), 2 inter-subdomain cross-linked pairs (K437 of IIIA to K561 of IIIB, K235 of IIA to K374 of IIB), as well as 2 intra-subdomain cross-linked peptides (K412 to K420 within IIIA, K455 to K463 within IIIA) were found.\nModification of BSA with DSS generated 17 cross-linked lysine pairs (Table 2). Of these, 11 pairs including K140\u2013K455, K437\u2013K561, K235\u2013K374, K228\u2013K489, K204\u2013K495, K211\u2013K463, K245\u2013K463, K455\u2013K463, K211\u2013245, K412\u2013420, and K138\u2013K140, were seen in the BS3-modified BSA. However, three through-space cross-linked pairs including K235\u2013K266, K235\u2013K263, and K548\u2013K559, along with a long-span internally cross-linked pair K88\u2013K100, and two short-span internally cross-linked pairs, K263\u2013K266, and K495\u2013K498, were observed only in the DSS-modified BSA. In contrast, the internally cross-linked pairs K399\u2013K401 and K156\u2013K160 were observed only with the BS3-modified BSA.\nWhen hydrophobic cross-linkers were used, 5% DMSO was included in the reaction mixture. However, DMSO had no influence on the integrity of the BSA conformation, as cross-linking of BSA with BS3 in the presence or absence of 5% DMSO generated virtually the same results (data not shown). One plausible explanation for the additional cross-linked pairs using DSS is that some lysine residues may not be accessible to the cross-linker BS3 due to hydrophobicity of the surrounding environments. For example, K100 is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues, including leucine, cysteine, valine, and alanine, and thus is more accessible to hydrophobic cross-linker DSS but not to BS3. This view is corroborated with the observation that the cross-linking between K88 and K100 was found only with hydrophobic cross-linker DSS and not with BS3, even though end-capping at K88 was observed with both cross-linkers. Similarly, K498 is located in the hydrophobic pockets in the IIIA domain, surrounded by cysteines. Also, K548 and K559 are located in the hydrophobic cavity of the IIIB domain; K263 and K266 are also located in the hydrophobic region in IIA . These lysine residues in the hydrophobic regions may not be accessible to BS3, and therefore, were not cross-linked when a water soluble BS3 was used as a cross-linker. In contrast, K156 or K160 might be easily accessible to BS3 but not to DSS, due to the influence of the nearby hydroxyl group of Y161 . As a consequence, the cross-linking of K156\u2013K160 occurred only when BS3 was used. Likewise, K399 and K401, modified only with BS3 (Table 1), may be spatially surrounded with polar side chains, preventing the penetration of the hydrophobic cross-linkers to these lysine residues.\nThe lysines that are located at the interfaces between helices or turns between domains, including K138 and K140 (interface between h6 and h7 of IA); K489 (interface between h4\u2013h5 of IIIA); K228 (right before the interface between h1 and h2 of IIA); K204 and K211 (turn between IB and IIA); K495 (near interface between h4 and h5 of IIIA); K463 (interface between h3 and h4 of IIIA); K412 (turn between IIB and IIIA), K420 (interface between h1 and h2 of IIIA); K561 (interface between h8 and h9 of IIIB); K437(near the interface between h2 and h3 of IIIA); K88 (interface between h3 and h4 of IA); K245 (near the interface between h2 and h3 of IIA), are exposed to the surface, and therefore, accessible to both water-soluble BS3 and hydrophobic DSS, for cross-linking reactions, as evidenced by most of the common cross-linked pairs. Considering the length of flexible lysine side chains, the maximum span allowed by the cross-linking with DSS or BS3 is approximately 24 \u00c5 . Therefore, the distance between the cross-linked lysine pairs should be within 24 \u00c5.\nThe spacer arm length of DSG is 7.7 \u00c5, which is shorter than that of DSS or BS3 (11.4 \u00c5) by 3.7 \u00c5. Accordingly, the maximum distance between lysine pairs cross-linked with DSG would be approximately 20 \u00c5. Of the 17 cross-linked pairs found in DSS- modified BSA, only 12 were identified using DSG. This information further refined the distance constraint for these 12 lysine pairs to approximately 20 \u00c5 (Table 3). However, the remaining five cross-linked pairs, including K140\u2013K455, K235\u2013K374, K245\u2013K463, K211\u2013K245, and K412\u2013420, were not found, implying that the K\u2013K distances for these lysine pairs are greater than 20 \u00c5 but less than 24 \u00c5.\nOf the total 19 cross-linked lysine pairs observed with BSA, only 6 homologous pairs can be found in the HSA crystal structure (PDB entry 1ao6). The K\u2013K distances of these pairs were obtained using Protein Explorer (version 1.982) (Tables 1\u20133). The distance constraints obtained in this study are consistent with the HSA crystal structure with the exception of K235-K374. The distance between K235 and K374 in BSA is expected to be between 20 and 24 \u00c5, based on the fact that they were cross-linked with DSS but not with DSG. However, the distance between the corresponding lysine residues K236 and K375 in HSA is 13.4 \u00c5, suggesting that the 3-D structure of BSA may deviate from that of HSA in this region. The information on the distance constraints obtained from the cross-linked lysine residues, particularly for which homologous lysines were not found in HSA, should be valuable in assisting the characterization of BSA conformation.\nWe have used mass spectrometric analysis coupled with chemical cross-linking to probe the 3-D structure of BSA. Because BSA contains 60 lysines, lysine specific cross-linkers were employed. Considering that many lysine residues exist in the hydrophobic regions, the hydrophobic cross-linkers DSS and DSG, as well as the water-soluble cross-linker, BS3, were used to obtain complementary information. The through-space cross-linked peptides were identified rapidly with the assistance of O-18 labeling during digestion with trypsin. The O-18 labeling also assisted in the interpretation of MS/MS spectra of the cross-linked peptides by distinguishing the C-terminal ions from N-terminal ions. Each cross-linked peptide was characterized by MS/MS for unambiguous assignment. The distance constraints were obtained from 12 through-space and 7 internally cross-linked lysine pairs identified in this study. Our data indicated that the distance between K140 of IA and K455 of IIIA, K235 of IIA and K374 of IIB, K245 of IIA and K463 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA and K245 of IIA, and K412 and 420 of IIIA, is between 20 and 24 \u00c5. The distance constraints for 12 lysine pairs including K235\u2013K266, K437\u2013K561, K228\u2013K489, K204\u2013K495, K211\u2013K463, K235\u2013K263, K455\u2013K463, K548\u2013K559, K88\u2013K100, K263\u2013K266, K138\u2013K140, and K495\u2013K498, were found to be approximately 20 \u00c5. The distance constraints obtained in this study also suggested that K235 and K374 are farther away from each other in BSA molecule in comparison to the corresponding lysine residues in HSA. We have demonstrated in this study that chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometric detection can be employed to readily generate the 3-D information of BSA. With proper choice of cross-linking criteria, for example, using multiple cross-linkers with different span lengths and chemistry, comprehensive information about the tertiary structure can be obtained for proteins of interest.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulatory system. The most important physiological function of serum albumin is to maintain the osmotic pressure and pH of blood , and transport a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds including fatty acids, metal, amino acids, steroids and drugs . Because of these extraordinary characteristics, albumins from various sources have gained extensive biomedical and industrial applications as well as research interest. The crystal structure of human serum albumin (HSA) has been determined and the interaction with fatty acids has been studied for HSA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) . Although the conformation of BSA is thought to be similar to HSA due to 76% of amino acid sequence homology, the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of BSA has yet to be characterized.\nThe biological function of a protein depends on its conformation. The most informative method to study the 3-D structure of proteins is X-ray crystallography. The X-ray crystallography, which provides information regarding the atomic distances of a crystallized compound, is not always applicable because not all proteins can be readily crystallized. In addition, proteins rarely exist as crystals under physiological conditions, but are soluble in cytosol or associated with the membrane or other components of the cell. A native biochemical condition is often required to maintain an optimal biological activity of proteins. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can generate the tertiary structural information of proteins in solution, and therefore, complementing X-ray crystallography. However, both techniques require large amount of samples, imposing limitations in many biological settings.\nOver the past years mass spectrometry, in conjunction with chemical cross-linking, has emerged as a sensitive tool for probing the tertiary structure of proteins . A protein is modified covalently by bi-functional cross-linking reagents, followed by proteolytic digestion. Cross-linked peptides are analyzed by mass spectrometry to assign the amino acid residues participating in the cross-linking. The maximum distance between the cross-linked residues is dependent on the cross-linker arm length. This information generates the intramolecular distance constraints, assisting computational method to determine the 3-D atomic arrangement of a protein. The approach is rapid and requires small amounts of proteins with no limitation on the size of the molecule. In addition, the method can be applied in native biochemical conditions, showing promises in studying conformational changes of a protein associated with its biological function. Recently, Back et al. has used the O-18 labeled proteolysis to unambiguously recognize the cross-linking between two peptide segments . In the mass spectra of peptides obtained from the cross-linked proteins digested in O-18 water, the through-space cross-linked peptides were distinguished by a characteristic 8 Da mass shift, whereas the non-modified, internally cross-linked or end-capped peptides showed a 4 Da mass shift. The mass shifts rely on the complete incorporation of two O-18 atoms during proteolytic hydrolysis for each C-terminus ending with either lysine or arginine .\nIn this study, we probe the conformation of BSA by mass spectrometry, combined with lysine-specific cross-linking and tryptic digestion. To generate information about the distance constraints for BSA, which contains 60 lysines as well as many hydrophobic pockets, we used three different lysine-specific cross-linkers of varying spacer arm lengths and hydrophobicity (Figure 1). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, (BS3), a water-soluble chemical cross-linker with a spacer arm length of 11.4 \u00c5, was chosen to generate information of the lysine\u2013lysine distance constraints for the lysines in the hydrophilic or surface regions. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a water-insoluble analog of BS3 whose reactivity and spacer arm length are virtually identical to BS3 , was used in an attempt to generate the cross-linking information for the lysines in the hydrophobic regions. In addition, we used disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), a hydrophobic cross-linker with a shorter spacer arm length (7.7 \u00c5), to further refine the distance constraints between lysine residues in the BSA molecule. Each cross-linked peptide was recognized with the aid of O-18 labeling and characterized by the MS/MS analysis. The distance constraints obtained from the cross-linked lysine residues in BSA were compared with the distance between the corresponding lysine residues in HSA from the crystal structure, wherever such comparison was feasible.\nFatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), and disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Modified trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). O-18 enriched water (99%) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Potassium phosphate was purchased from Mallinckrodt (Phillipsburg, NJ). Pure water was obtained from a Milli-Q UV plus ultra-pure water system (Bedford, MA). Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).\nBSA at 10 \u03bcM in phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was incubated with 500 \u03bcM cross-linkers (prepared freshly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions) at room temperature for 30 min. This condition represents a cross-linker to protein ratio of 50:1. We have also used a cross-linker to protein ratio of 20:1, which is supposed to generate only one cross-linking per molecule [24], and found virtually identical results. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra for the BSA molecules cross-linked under our experimental condition was also identical to that of the non-cross-linked control (data not shown), indicating that no major conformational changes occurred due to cross-linking. The reaction was quenched with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The protein was reduced with dithiothreitol (100 mM) for 1 h at 56 \u00b0C and alkylated with iodoacetamide (100 mM) for 45 min at room temperature. The sample mixture was dialyzed against pure water using a membrane with MW cutoff of 3500 Da (Waters) three times within 24 h. The sample was divided into two equal aliquots which were dried using a vacuum centrifuge. As described by Back , the samples were reconstituted in either pure water or 99% O-18 enriched water containing 5% ACN. The reconstituted mixture was subjected to tryptic digestion at 37 \u00b0C for 20 h with a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:10. Alternatively, after reduction and alkylation, SDS/PAGE was carried out to isolate the intramolecular-crosslinked monomer from the intermolecular-crosslinked multimers. The monomer was subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Under our experimental conditions, the multimeric bands were not observed after visualization with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.\nAfter desalting using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the tryptic peptides were analyzed by a QSTAR pulsar Qq-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Toronto, CA) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. The ion source voltage was set at 1100 V in the positive ion mode. A full mass spectrum was acquired over an m/z range of 500\u20132000, and the ions of interest were subjected to collision-induced dissociation using high purity argon for MS/MS analysis.\nLC-nano-ESI MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap XCT mass spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system. Peptides were separated using a Zorbax 300 SB C18 column (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 150 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Wilmington, DE) using a mobile phase that contained Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mobile phase composition was held initially at 2% B for 3 min and then changed from 2\u201380% B over 80 min. A capillary voltage was set at 1600 V. The mass spectrometer was scanned from 300 to 2000 m/z range.\nThe mass values of tryptic peptides were assigned with the help of the Protein Analysis Work Sheet (PAWS) (ProteoMetrics, NY). The cross-linked tryptic peptide peaks were distinguished by the comparison of the mass spectra obtained from the digests of the non-cross-linked control or cross-linked BSA. The through-space cross-linked peptide peaks were confirmed by the characteristic 8 Da mass shift when digested in O-18 water. The identity of the cross-linked peptides was revealed through the amino acid sequence information obtained using the MS/MS analysis.\nThe 3-D structure of BSA is believed to be very similar to HSA, because the two proteins share 76% sequence identity. Figure 2a shows the crystal structure of HSA and the amino acid sequences of BSA and HSA. The heart-shaped HSA molecule is made up of three homologous \u03b1-helical domains (I, II, III) . Each domain contains two subdomains (A and B) that share common structure motifs. Each domain can be divided into 10 helical segments: for example, h1\u2013h6 for the Subdomain A and h7\u2013h10 for the Subdomain B (Figure 2b). Human serum albumin structure is predominantly \u03b1-helical (67%) with the remaining polypeptide occurring in turns and extended or flexible regions between subdomains, and contains no \u03b2-sheets . The subdomain information is indicated along with the amino acid sequences of BSA and HSA. The distance constraints between lysine residues in BSA obtained in the present study was compared with the distances of the corresponding lysine residues of HSA determined by the crystal structure, if such corresponding residues are present.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the cross-linked peptides can be identified by comparing the mass spectra of tryptic digests obtained from unmodified (3a) and BS3-modified BSA (3b,c). The newly emerging peptide peaks in the spectra from BS3-modified BSA digested with trypsin in O-16 water (3b) or 99% O-18 water (3c) revealed the nature of the cross-linking. With the digestion in O-18 water, the characteristic mass shifts of 8 Da confirmed the through-space cross-linking peptides, whereas the cross-linked peptides within one segment or peptides end-capped with the cross-linker showed 4 Da shift. An example is shown in Figure 3b for a representative through-space cross-linked peptide with a mass value of 2952.5, which was reconstructed from a triply charged ion at m/z 985.2 (inset). In the spectrum of BS3-modified BSA digested in O-18 water (Figure 3c), the corresponding peak appeared at a mass of 2960.5 which was derived from the triply charged ion detected at m/z 987.9. The 8 Da difference in the mass indicated that this peak resulted from through-space cross-linking.\nThe identity of the cross-linked peptides detected as the triply charged ion at m/z 985.2 was determined by the amino acid sequence analyzed by MS/MS, as shown in Figure 4. Clearly, the data revealed that this peak resulted from the through-space cross-linking between the segments A[233\u2013241]R, and L[372\u2013386]K, with K235 from the Subdomain IIA cross-linked to K374 from the Subdomain IIB. Good coverage of y-series ions was observed for both segments. The amide bond cleavages due to the fragmentation of A[233\u2013241]R are labeled with lower case letters, whereas those from L[372\u2013386]K are marked with upper case letters. O-18 labeling during tryptic digestion assisted in distinguishing the C-terminal ions from the N-terminal ions. The y ions from O-18 labeled peptides showed a mass shift of 4 Da in comparison to the corresponding y ions, because these ions contained a single C-terminus. In contrast, b ions were not affected by O-18 labeling as shown for B3 or b3 at m/z 451 as an example. The B3 or b3 ion in this case included C8H12O2 of BS3 with a net mass increase of 138 considering the loss of two hydrogen atoms from the lysine side chains upon cross-linking.\nIn some cases, LC/MS/MS analyses allowed more reliable identification of cross-linked peptides as the separation of the tryptic peptide mixture precedes the mass spectrometric detection. Figure 5 depicts a typical extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) reconstructed for a cross-linked peptide with a molecular weight of 1974 Da. The peptide was detected as triply and quadruply charged ions at m/z 659.0 and 494.5, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 5b, and therefore, these two ions were used to reconstruct the ion chromatogram. This chromatographic peak eluting at 27.8 min was observed in the digests of the BS3-modified BSA, and as expected, was not present in the digest from the unmodified control BSA (Figure 5a). The corresponding chromatographic peak for the O-18 labeled peptides contained the triply charged ion at m/z 661.7 and quadruply charged ion at m/z 496.5, representing a through-space cross-linked peptide with the molecular weight of 1982 (Figure 5c).\nFigure 6 shows the MS/MS spectra for the triply charged ions at m/z 659.0 and 661.7 derived from O-16 and O-18 labeled digests. The fragments detected in the spectra revealed that this peptide resulted from the cross-linking between the segments E[210\u2013218]R and L[242\u2013248]K, with K211 (located in the turn between Subdomain IB and Subdomain IIA) linked to K245 (from Subdomain IIA). The assignment of each fragment was assisted by O-18 labeling. For example, the fragment ion at m/z 1080.6 appeared in both O-16 and O-18 labeled peptide spectra, indicating that it belonged to the N-terminal ions. The singly charged ion of m/z 1225.5 increased 4 mass units in the O-18 trace, implying that this ion contained only one C-terminus. The doubly charged fragment ion of 923.0 shifted to 927.0 for the O-18 labeled peptide, reflecting a mass shift of 8 Da. Therefore, this ion was readily identified as a y-series ion containing both C-termini of the cross-linked segments. For the fragment ions containing both segments the loss of NH3 was commonly observed as shown for y9Y4, y9Y5, y9Y6, b2Y7, and b3Y7 ions. The ion y9Y4 represented the fragment containing y9 from the peptide segment of E[210\u2013218]R and Y4 of the segment L[242\u2013248]K plus C8H12O2 of BS3 (net mass increase of 138). According to the above information, the fragment ions detected in the MS/MS spectra of all the cross-linked peptides were unambiguously assigned. A summary of all the cross-linked and end-capped peptides detected by LC/MS and Qq-TOF is presented in Table 1. Nine through space and four internally cross-linked peptides as well as two end-capped peptides were identified and characterized. The table also lists the distances between the corresponding lysine residues from the crystal structure of HSA molecule as a comparison for the distance constraints obtained in this study.\nFigure 7 depicts representative reconstructed mass spectra of tryptic digests obtained from unmodified control (7a), DSS (7b, c) or DSG-modified BSA (7d, e). The cross-linked BSA was digested in either O-16 or O-18 water. The newly formed cross-linked peptides were identified by Qq-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the digests from the DSS-modified or DSG-modified BSA. An example is shown for a peak with a mass of 3251.5 reconstructed from the quadruply charged ion of m/z 813.9 (inset b), which appeared in the mass spectrum of DSS-modified BSA digested with trypsin in O-16 water. Its mass shifted to 3259.6 (reconstructed from 815.9, inset c) in the corresponding O-18 spectrum, indicating a through-space cross-linking. In the mass spectrum of DSG-modified BSA digested in O-16 water, a new peak with mass of 3209.7 (reconstructed from the quadruply charged ion of m/z 803.4, inset d) was observed. The peak showed an increase of 8 Da in mass (3217.6 Da, reconstructed from 805.4, inset,e) in the corresponding O-18 spectrum. The MS/MS spectrum of the peak with the mass of 3251.5 or 3259.6 (O-16 or O-18) was essentially the same as that from the peak with the mass of 3209.7 or 3217.6 (O-16 or O-18) shown in Figure 8. The MS/MS analyses revealed that the peaks originated from the cross-linking between K235 in helix 2, and K263 of helix 3 in the Subdomain IIA, via C8H12O2 of DSS (net mass increase of 138) or C5H6O2 of DSG (net mass increase of 96), respectively. The LC-MS/MS results were consistent with the data obtained from static nanospray ionization/Qq-TOF analysis. Tables 2 and 3 list all cross-linked and capped peptides that were modified by DSS and DSG, respectively. Using DSS, 12 through-space and 5 internally cross-linked peptides, and 1 end-capped cross-linked peptide were identified. With DSG, 8 through-space and 4 internally cross-linked peptides, and 1 end-capped cross-linked peptide were detected.\nThe cross-linking with BS3 (Table 1) generated three short-span internal cross-linked peptides, which are within 7 amino acids in a segment (K138\u2013K140, K156\u2013K160, and K399\u2013K401). These peptides were of little value in providing the 3-D spatial constraints, because BS3 coupling with two lysines could span up to 7 amino acids . The remaining long-span internal cross-linking between K412 and K420 of the Subdomain IIIA, as well as the 9 through-space lysine cross-linking, should provide valuable information on the distance constraints in the 3-D structure of BSA. Six inter-domain cross-linked pairs (K140 of IA to K455 of IIIA, K228 of IIA to K489 of IIIA, K204 of IB/IIA to K495 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA to K463 of IIIA, K245 of IIA and K463 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA to K245 of IIA), 2 inter-subdomain cross-linked pairs (K437 of IIIA to K561 of IIIB, K235 of IIA to K374 of IIB), as well as 2 intra-subdomain cross-linked peptides (K412 to K420 within IIIA, K455 to K463 within IIIA) were found.\nModification of BSA with DSS generated 17 cross-linked lysine pairs (Table 2). Of these, 11 pairs including K140\u2013K455, K437\u2013K561, K235\u2013K374, K228\u2013K489, K204\u2013K495, K211\u2013K463, K245\u2013K463, K455\u2013K463, K211\u2013245, K412\u2013420, and K138\u2013K140, were seen in the BS3-modified BSA. However, three through-space cross-linked pairs including K235\u2013K266, K235\u2013K263, and K548\u2013K559, along with a long-span internally cross-linked pair K88\u2013K100, and two short-span internally cross-linked pairs, K263\u2013K266, and K495\u2013K498, were observed only in the DSS-modified BSA. In contrast, the internally cross-linked pairs K399\u2013K401 and K156\u2013K160 were observed only with the BS3-modified BSA.\nWhen hydrophobic cross-linkers were used, 5% DMSO was included in the reaction mixture. However, DMSO had no influence on the integrity of the BSA conformation, as cross-linking of BSA with BS3 in the presence or absence of 5% DMSO generated virtually the same results (data not shown). One plausible explanation for the additional cross-linked pairs using DSS is that some lysine residues may not be accessible to the cross-linker BS3 due to hydrophobicity of the surrounding environments. For example, K100 is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues, including leucine, cysteine, valine, and alanine, and thus is more accessible to hydrophobic cross-linker DSS but not to BS3. This view is corroborated with the observation that the cross-linking between K88 and K100 was found only with hydrophobic cross-linker DSS and not with BS3, even though end-capping at K88 was observed with both cross-linkers. Similarly, K498 is located in the hydrophobic pockets in the IIIA domain, surrounded by cysteines. Also, K548 and K559 are located in the hydrophobic cavity of the IIIB domain; K263 and K266 are also located in the hydrophobic region in IIA . These lysine residues in the hydrophobic regions may not be accessible to BS3, and therefore, were not cross-linked when a water soluble BS3 was used as a cross-linker. In contrast, K156 or K160 might be easily accessible to BS3 but not to DSS, due to the influence of the nearby hydroxyl group of Y161 . As a consequence, the cross-linking of K156\u2013K160 occurred only when BS3 was used. Likewise, K399 and K401, modified only with BS3 (Table 1), may be spatially surrounded with polar side chains, preventing the penetration of the hydrophobic cross-linkers to these lysine residues.\nThe lysines that are located at the interfaces between helices or turns between domains, including K138 and K140 (interface between h6 and h7 of IA); K489 (interface between h4\u2013h5 of IIIA); K228 (right before the interface between h1 and h2 of IIA); K204 and K211 (turn between IB and IIA); K495 (near interface between h4 and h5 of IIIA); K463 (interface between h3 and h4 of IIIA); K412 (turn between IIB and IIIA), K420 (interface between h1 and h2 of IIIA); K561 (interface between h8 and h9 of IIIB); K437(near the interface between h2 and h3 of IIIA); K88 (interface between h3 and h4 of IA); K245 (near the interface between h2 and h3 of IIA), are exposed to the surface, and therefore, accessible to both water-soluble BS3 and hydrophobic DSS, for cross-linking reactions, as evidenced by most of the common cross-linked pairs. Considering the length of flexible lysine side chains, the maximum span allowed by the cross-linking with DSS or BS3 is approximately 24 \u00c5 . Therefore, the distance between the cross-linked lysine pairs should be within 24 \u00c5.\nThe spacer arm length of DSG is 7.7 \u00c5, which is shorter than that of DSS or BS3 (11.4 \u00c5) by 3.7 \u00c5. Accordingly, the maximum distance between lysine pairs cross-linked with DSG would be approximately 20 \u00c5. Of the 17 cross-linked pairs found in DSS- modified BSA, only 12 were identified using DSG. This information further refined the distance constraint for these 12 lysine pairs to approximately 20 \u00c5 (Table 3). However, the remaining five cross-linked pairs, including K140\u2013K455, K235\u2013K374, K245\u2013K463, K211\u2013K245, and K412\u2013420, were not found, implying that the K\u2013K distances for these lysine pairs are greater than 20 \u00c5 but less than 24 \u00c5.\nOf the total 19 cross-linked lysine pairs observed with BSA, only 6 homologous pairs can be found in the HSA crystal structure (PDB entry 1ao6). The K\u2013K distances of these pairs were obtained using Protein Explorer (version 1.982) (Tables 1\u20133). The distance constraints obtained in this study are consistent with the HSA crystal structure with the exception of K235-K374. The distance between K235 and K374 in BSA is expected to be between 20 and 24 \u00c5, based on the fact that they were cross-linked with DSS but not with DSG. However, the distance between the corresponding lysine residues K236 and K375 in HSA is 13.4 \u00c5, suggesting that the 3-D structure of BSA may deviate from that of HSA in this region. The information on the distance constraints obtained from the cross-linked lysine residues, particularly for which homologous lysines were not found in HSA, should be valuable in assisting the characterization of BSA conformation.\nWe have used mass spectrometric analysis coupled with chemical cross-linking to probe the 3-D structure of BSA. Because BSA contains 60 lysines, lysine specific cross-linkers were employed. Considering that many lysine residues exist in the hydrophobic regions, the hydrophobic cross-linkers DSS and DSG, as well as the water-soluble cross-linker, BS3, were used to obtain complementary information. The through-space cross-linked peptides were identified rapidly with the assistance of O-18 labeling during digestion with trypsin. The O-18 labeling also assisted in the interpretation of MS/MS spectra of the cross-linked peptides by distinguishing the C-terminal ions from N-terminal ions. Each cross-linked peptide was characterized by MS/MS for unambiguous assignment. The distance constraints were obtained from 12 through-space and 7 internally cross-linked lysine pairs identified in this study. Our data indicated that the distance between K140 of IA and K455 of IIIA, K235 of IIA and K374 of IIB, K245 of IIA and K463 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA and K245 of IIA, and K412 and 420 of IIIA, is between 20 and 24 \u00c5. The distance constraints for 12 lysine pairs including K235\u2013K266, K437\u2013K561, K228\u2013K489, K204\u2013K495, K211\u2013K463, K235\u2013K263, K455\u2013K463, K548\u2013K559, K88\u2013K100, K263\u2013K266, K138\u2013K140, and K495\u2013K498, were found to be approximately 20 \u00c5. The distance constraints obtained in this study also suggested that K235 and K374 are farther away from each other in BSA molecule in comparison to the corresponding lysine residues in HSA. We have demonstrated in this study that chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometric detection can be employed to readily generate the 3-D information of BSA. With proper choice of cross-linking criteria, for example, using multiple cross-linkers with different span lengths and chemistry, comprehensive information about the tertiary structure can be obtained for proteins of interest."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nDiabetes mellitus is a worldwide public health problem. This metabolic disorder originates from an absolute or a relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. It is reflected by blood glucose concentrations higher than the normal range of 4.4\u20136.6 mM . Diabetes can lead to higher risks of heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes require a tight daily monitoring of the blood glucose level. Fast and accurate determination of glucose concentration are therefore of great importance.\nIn recent years, tremendous amount of attention and efforts have been paid to develop reliable glucose biosensors including electrochemical , surface-enhanced Raman scattering , chemiluminescence , electrochemical transistor sensor , potentiometric sensor , and other methods . Intracellular sensors for glucose, metabolic precursors, and signaling ligands such as amino acids have also been used for real-time detection, diagnosis, and classification of different forms of biochemical reactions within single cells in order to understand cellular behavior and the complex roles of these small molecules in biology. Such biosensors offer enormous potential to the development of cell-biology research . The use of nanomaterials has allowed the introduction of many new signal-transduction technologies in biosensors resulting in improved sensitivity and performance. Nanosensors, nanoprobes, and other nanosystems have also allowed simple and rapid analysis of in vivo measurements because their submicrometer dimensions are comparable to the size of target biological and chemical species being sensed, which render them excellent material choice for producing electrical signals . However, most of the intracellular biosensors involve indirect methods, or large experimental setups. A robust simple technique for intracellular measurement is thus highly desired.\nAmong all glucose biosensors, enzyme-based electrochemical glucose biosensors have been in the main focus of biosensor research because of their simplicity, relatively low cost, and high sensitivity . The intrinsic advantages of electrochemical biosensors are their robustness, easy miniaturization, excellent detection limits, also with small sample volumes, and ability to be used in turbid biofluids. In enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors, enzyme immobilization is regarded to be one of the most important issues. Since proper immobilization of enzymes on a suitable matrix and their stability are important factors in the fabrication of biosensors, the search of support materials that provide large surface area for higher enzyme loading and a compatible microenvironment that helps enzyme bioactivity is thus of great importance.\nRecently, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures have attracted considerable interest in the applications of biosensors due to many advantages, including non-toxicity, bio-safety, excellent biological compatibility, high electron-transfer rates, enhanced analytical performance, increased sensitivity, and easy preparation . In addition, it is important to note that ZnO is relatively stable around biological pH-values, which makes ZnO compatible with biological fluids and species . Furthermore, the high isoelectric point (IEP) of ZnO (IEP 9.5) makes it a good matrix for immobilizing low IEP acidic proteins or DNA by electrostatic interactions with high binding stability . This will suit glucose oxidase (GOD) which has an IEP of 4.5 and is widely employed in most of the glucose biosensors due to its stability and high selectivity to glucose. All these advantageous properties render ZnO suitable for sensitive intracellular ion measurements and can allow for stable and reversible signals with respect to glucose concentration changes.\nIn previous investigations, we have successfully demonstrated that ZnO nanorods can be used to measure the intracellular Ca2+ and glucose concentrations in human adipocytes and frog oocytes . This has proved that ZnO nanostructures have the potential to measure intracellular biological species in living cells. However, there has been no report of using other alternative materials to improve the performance of this intracellular glucose biosensor. Many methods, such as covalent bonding , embedding , and cross-linking , have been used to immobilize GOD on different supporting materials. As compared to ZnO nanorods and nanowires, ZnO nanotubes and nanoporous material possess several interesting unique properties such as highly dispersed structure and large surface area. There have been reports on the use of tubular ZnO structures as amperometric extracellular glucose biosensors with improved performance and higher sensitivity compared to ZnO nanorods and nanowires . It has also been reported that the low IEP enzyme GOD binds well on the ZnO nanoporous material , resulting in enhanced sensitivity of the glucose biosensors.\nThe focus of the current study is to demonstrate an intracellular glucose biosensor based on a nano-honeycomb ZnO as an alternative to ZnO-nanorod-based sensors. Our main effort has been directed to the construction of tips coated with functionalized nanoflake ZnO that are selective to glucose and capable of gently penetrating the cell membrane. The new design differs from the previous ones by the introduction of a nanoflake ZnO that provides a larger surface area for the immobilization of GOD, which will lead to higher sensitivity and stability due to higher capture efficiency provided by higher surface-to-volume ratio. This offers a new simple and reliable way to measure intracellular glucose concentrations within single living cells.\nGlucose oxidase (E.C. 1.1.3.4) from Aspergillus niger 360 U/mg was purchased from BBI Enzymes (UK) Ltd. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, \u226598%), glutaraldehyde (50% solution), Nafion (5 wt%), d-(+)-glucose (99.5%), Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Borosilicate glass capillaries (sterile Femtotip II with tip inner diameter of 0.5 \u03bcm, tip outer diameter of 0.7 \u03bcm, and length of 49 mm) were purchased from Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 10 mM solution was prepared from Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4 (Sigma Aldrich) with 0.135 M NaCl and pH was adjusted to 7.4. Glucose stock solution was kept at least 24 h after preparation for mutarotation. All chemicals used (Sigma Aldrich) were of analytical reagent grade.\nHuman adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of pieces of subcutaneous adipose tissue , obtained during elective surgery at the University Hospital in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden (all patients gave their informed consent and procedures were approved by the local ethics committee). The adipocytes were incubated overnight before use as described by Str\u00e5lfors and Honor , and used in a Krebs\u2013Ringer solution buffered with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 .\nOocytes from female Xenopus laevis were obtained as previously described . In brief, a X. laevis was anesthetized in a bath with tricaine (1.4 g/L, Sigma Aldrich) and ovarian lobes were cut off through a small abdominal incision (procedure approved by the local ethics committee). Oocytes were manually dissected into smaller groups and defolliculated by enzymatic treatment with liberase (Roche Diagnostics, Sweden) for 2.5 h. Stage-III and -VI oocytes (approximately 1 mm in diameter) without spots and with clear delimitation between the animal and vegetal pole were selected. Oocytes were kept in MBS solution (in mM: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 15 HEPES, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, pH adjusted to 7.6 by NaOH) supplemented with 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 U/mL penicillin, and 25 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all from Sigma Aldrich) at 11 \u00b0C for 1\u20135 days before measurements.\nA main effort has been directed to make the tip geometry of intracellular electrodes extremely sharp (submicrometer dimension) and long enough (>10 \u03bcm) to be manipulated into small living cells.\nThe selective intracellular glucose measurements were accomplished by a potentiometric method utilizing two electrodes: (1) An Ag/AgCl electrode as the intracellular reference microelectrode, and (2) an intracellular aluminum electrode covered with nanoflake ZnO with attached enzyme molecules.\nThe reference microelectrode was prepared from a borosilicate glass capillary fixed on a flat support in the vacuum chamber of an evaporation system (Evaporator Satis CR725). First chromium and then silver (with a thickness of 10 and 125 nm, respectively) were uniformly deposited onto the outer surface of the capillary tip. The AgCl tip coating was prepared electrochemically by dipping the silver coated end of one capillary in 0.2 M HCl solution and then by electrolyzing the silver film to form AgCl by polarizing it at 1.0 V for 1 min.\nAnother borosilicate glass capillary was fixed on a flat support in the vacuum chamber of an evaporation system and titanium and aluminum (with a thickness of 10 and 200 nm, respectively) were uniformly deposited onto the outer surface of the capillary tip. After that the tip was first dipped into a seed solution for 2 min and then baked for 3 min at a temperature of 110 \u00b0C as described in Ref. . In the second step, nanoflake ZnO was grown by a hydrothermal process as described in Ref. . In brief, the growth solution contained 0.025 M Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O and 0.025 M hexamethylenetetramine. The solution was kept at 90 \u00b0C for 4 h to form nanoflake ZnO as shown in Fig. 1a. Before functionalization, the glucose-sensing microelectrode was carefully cleaned with de-ionized water and dried in the air. The electrical contact was attached to the surface of the prepared electrodes for obtaining electrical signal during measurements.\nBefore immobilization of the enzyme, the ZnO covered microelectrode was rinsed with PBS to generate a hydrophilic surface. Enzyme solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg GOD and 20 mg BSA in 200 \u03bcL PBS. The electrode was dipped into the enzyme solution for 15 min where after it was left in the air for 20 min to dry. The cross-linking procedure was carried out by adding 2 \u03bcL aqueous solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% Nafion onto the electrode surface. After drying at room temperature, 2 \u03bcL of 0.5% Nafion solution was further applied onto the electrode surface to prevent possible enzyme leakage and to eliminate foreign interferences. All enzyme-covered microelectrodes were stored in dry condition at 4 \u00b0C when not in use.\nThe morphology of ZnO was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, and the crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction. Elemental analysis was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. All the electrochemical experiments were carried out using a Metrohm pH meter model 744 (Metrohm Ltd., Switzerland). For the time response measurements, a model 363A potentiostat/galvanostat (EG&G Ltd., USA) was used.\nFig. 1a shows scanning electron microscopy images of the nanoflake ZnO grown on the tip of the borosilicate glass capillary before enzyme immobilization. As clearly seen, nano-honeycomb structures with a wall thickness around 200 nm with uniform density and spatial distribution had been formed on the tip of the electrode.\nIt has been shown in previous studies that aluminum directs the growth of the nano-honeycomb ZnO and suppresses the growth along the [0 0 1] direction . Aluminum substrates are known to favor the synthesis of ZnO nanomaterials with 2D morphology . The dissolution of aluminum is a prerequisite and since aluminum is an amphoteric metal, it can be dissolved under alkaline conditions in the presence of an amine (such as hexamethylenetetramine) forming Al(OH)4 \u2212. In addition, the additive ions usually act as regulators to promote or inhibit the growth by capping the ZnO surface . Presumably Al(OH)4 \u2212 binds to the Zn2+ terminated (0 0 1) surface suppressing the growth along [0 0 1] direction. This triggers the lateral growth that forms oriented nanoflake ZnO .\nThe X-ray diffraction pattern of the nanoflake ZnO is shown in Fig. 1b. All three peaks that belong to ZnO indicate formation of single-phase ZnO with wurtzite structure. Fig. 1c shows energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, indicating that the nano-honeycomb structure consists of Zn and O. Fig. 1d shows a scanning electron microscopy image of the nanoflake ZnO after modification with GOD and Nafion.\nThe sensing mechanism of most electrochemical glucose sensors is based on the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by GOD according to the following reaction: H2O+O2+\u03b2-d-glucose\u27f6GOD\u03b4-d-gluconolactone+H2O2 as a result of this reaction, \u03b4-d-gluconolactone and H2O2 are produced. The concentration of these two products and the oxygen consumption can be used for the glucose determination. With H2O available in the reaction, gluconolactone is spontaneously converted to gluconic acid, which at neutral pH, form the charged products of gluconate\u2212 and H+, according to the equation below: \u03b4-d-gluconolactone\u27f6spontaneousd-gluconate\u2212+H+ this protolytic reaction results in a decrease of the pH and can be used for determination of the glucose concentration . In our case, it is the resulting change in ionic distribution around the ZnO crystal structure that causes a change of the overall potential of the glucose-sensing microelectrode.\nFirst, the extracellular function of the GOD immobilized on the ZnO electrode was tested. A two-electrode configuration with the glucose-sensing and Ag/AgCl microelectrodes was employed for microliter volumes in the electrochemical measurements. The extracellular potentiometric response of the two microelectrodes was studied for calibration purpose in a buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) with glucose concentrations ranging from 500 nM to 10 mM. The response time when glucose was added to the solution was fast, reaching 95% of the steady-state potential within 4 s. A typical example of the response for 50 \u03bcM glucose is shown in Fig. 2a. The steady-state potential showed linear dependence with the logarithm of the glucose concentration over the complete glucose concentration range studied (Fig. 2b). This is an improvement over the previously proposed ZnO-nanorod-based intracellular glucose-sensing microelectrode , which failed to show linear response for glucose concentration over 1 mM. This wider range could be due to the different immobilization techniques used in the new sensor, in which immobilized GOD retained its enzymatic activity for a longer duration and the prevention of possible enzyme leakage from the electrode by the Nafion membrane coating which also reduces foreign interferences. The sensitivity of the nanoflake ZnO sensor was \u221265.2 mV/decade (Fig. 2b), which is 1.6\u20131.8 times higher sensitivity than for earlier reported glucose sensors . The higher sensitivity may be ascribed to the fact that nano-honeycomb structures provide a larger and more accessible surface area, which might lead to different enzymes coverage and a different distribution of reactants on the ZnO surface at equilibrium.\nIn order to measure the intracellular glucose concentration in a single human adipocyte, a glass slide (5 cm length, 4 cm width, and 0.17 mm thickness) with sparsely distributed human adipocytes was placed on the microscope stage. The microelectrodes, mounted on a micropipette holder of a micromanipulation system, were then gently micromanipulated into the cell using the hydraulic fine adjustments for penetrating the cell membrane and extending a short way into the cell as shown schematically in Fig. 3 . Once the microelectrodes were inside the cell, the electrochemical potential difference signal could be measured and the glucose concentration determined. The intracellular glucose concentration in a single human adipocyte was 60 \u00b1 15 \u03bcM (n = 5), corresponding well with the 70 \u03bcM intracellular concentration determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in rat muscle tissue in the presence of a high, 10 mM, extracellular glucose concentration . As soon as we got a stable potential for intracellular measurement, a 3 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM insulin was injected into the total volume of 0.25 mL of extracellular solution, and the glucose concentration in the cell increased from 60 \u00b1 15 to 130 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM (n = 5). It took a few minutes to reach the final potential for intracellular glucose uptake as shown in Fig. 4a. The increase in intracellular glucose after insulin treatment was expected because insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake as shown schematically in Fig. 4b. Insulin binds to its receptor at the cell surface. This initiates an intracellular signal-transduction causing translocation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4; encoded by the GLUT4 gene) from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane. After integration into the plasma membrane, GLUT4 allows glucose to enter the cell down a concentration gradient.\nIn the human body, the hormone insulin only stimulates glucose transport into muscle and fat cells. However, insulin has also been found to affect glucose uptake in oocytes from X. laevis . The large size of these cells makes it possible to micro-inject specific reagents that interrupt or activate signal transmission to glucose. Thus, in another set of experiment, we used the microelectrodes to measure the intracellular glucose concentration in single frog oocytes. The intracellular concentration was 110 \u00b1 20 \u03bcM (n = 5), which was slightly higher than what has been reported (<50 \u03bcM) in a previous investigation using another method . We do not know the reason for this difference, but one possibility is that the electrodes behave slightly different inside the oocyte than outside, where they were calibrated. To test if the electrode can monitor changes in the glucose concentration inside the frog oocytes, 10 nM insulin again was added to the cell medium and the glucose concentration in the frog oocytes increased from 110 \u00b1 20 to 225 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM. The increase in glucose response and stabilized on the new value could be noted within few minutes.\nThe introduction of the ZnO nanosensor into the cytoplasm of the single living cell did not visibly seem to affect cellular viability. The viability of the penetrated cells depends strongly on the size of the sensor. This study demonstrated that size of the proposed sensor made it a minimally invasive tool appropriate for monitoring glucose changes inside living cells of the actual size.\nTo obtain an accurate and reusable glucose-sensing microelectrode, parameters such as reproducibility, stability, and anti-interference were examined. Fig. 5a shows a reproducibility test of 5 independently developed ZnO nanosensor in human adipocytes. The relative standard deviation determined from this measurement was less than 5%.\nFig. 5b displays the results of three experiments for the same glucose-sensing microelectrode showing good repeatability and linearity in various glucose concentrations PBS solution (pH 7.4). The glucose-sensing microelectrode was carefully washed with de-ionized water after each measurement to clean and to remove the residual ions from the surface of the electrode.\nThe selectivity of a glucose-sensing microelectrode depends on two major factors: the enzyme analyte reaction and the selective measurements. The enzyme analyte reaction with \u03b2-d-glucose is highly specific without any major interfering reaction with other types of sugars. It could however, be useful to control for possible interferences from reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, which are well known interferents with amperometric GOD biosensors. The results are shown in Fig. 5c and clearly demonstrate that the addition of these potential interferents did not substantially change the signal. Addition of 100 \u03bcM of ascorbic acid or uric acid to 1000 \u03bcM glucose only generated some small transient signals. Also long-term measurements could be a problem because of the solubility of ZnO in aqueous solution although the solubility is lowest at neutral pH. Furthermore, the experiments described here were short and could be performed without influence of this drawback. However, if the long-term stability really is an issue it can be improved to the same level as for most other sensors in use by a thin membrane coating .\nNanoflake ZnO was grown on the tip of an aluminum-coated glass capillary to be used as basis for an intracellular glucose biosensor as an alternative to previously used ZnO nanowires. By growing the ZnO on aluminum the crystal growth was directed towards a nano-honeycomb structure well suited for electrostatic immobilization of the glucose oxidase enzyme. For increased stability and selectivity the sensing layer was protected by Nafion. The sensor was tested in measurements of glucose in human adipocytes and frog oocytes giving results consistent with the values reported in the literature. It was also possible to monitor the time course of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by the cells. The developed sensor showed reliable stability, selectivity, and reproducibility. It was insensitive to compounds known to interfere with amperometric measurements. The proposed biosensor showed a fast response within 4 s and an improved linear electrochemical response (EMF) over a wide range of glucose concentrations (500 nM\u201310 mM) as well as higher sensitivity than previous micro/nanosensor concepts. The fabrication method used for this intracellular sensor is simple and can be used to immobilize other enzymes and bio-molecular species with low isoelectric points. An advantage to potentiometric devices in intracellular measurements is that they can be tuned for very low analyte consumption, which is of particular importance in intracellular applications.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide public health problem. This metabolic disorder originates from an absolute or a relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. It is reflected by blood glucose concentrations higher than the normal range of 4.4\u20136.6 mM . Diabetes can lead to higher risks of heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes require a tight daily monitoring of the blood glucose level. Fast and accurate determination of glucose concentration are therefore of great importance.\nIn recent years, tremendous amount of attention and efforts have been paid to develop reliable glucose biosensors including electrochemical , surface-enhanced Raman scattering , chemiluminescence , electrochemical transistor sensor , potentiometric sensor , and other methods . Intracellular sensors for glucose, metabolic precursors, and signaling ligands such as amino acids have also been used for real-time detection, diagnosis, and classification of different forms of biochemical reactions within single cells in order to understand cellular behavior and the complex roles of these small molecules in biology. Such biosensors offer enormous potential to the development of cell-biology research . The use of nanomaterials has allowed the introduction of many new signal-transduction technologies in biosensors resulting in improved sensitivity and performance. Nanosensors, nanoprobes, and other nanosystems have also allowed simple and rapid analysis of in vivo measurements because their submicrometer dimensions are comparable to the size of target biological and chemical species being sensed, which render them excellent material choice for producing electrical signals . However, most of the intracellular biosensors involve indirect methods, or large experimental setups. A robust simple technique for intracellular measurement is thus highly desired.\nAmong all glucose biosensors, enzyme-based electrochemical glucose biosensors have been in the main focus of biosensor research because of their simplicity, relatively low cost, and high sensitivity . The intrinsic advantages of electrochemical biosensors are their robustness, easy miniaturization, excellent detection limits, also with small sample volumes, and ability to be used in turbid biofluids. In enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors, enzyme immobilization is regarded to be one of the most important issues. Since proper immobilization of enzymes on a suitable matrix and their stability are important factors in the fabrication of biosensors, the search of support materials that provide large surface area for higher enzyme loading and a compatible microenvironment that helps enzyme bioactivity is thus of great importance.\nRecently, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures have attracted considerable interest in the applications of biosensors due to many advantages, including non-toxicity, bio-safety, excellent biological compatibility, high electron-transfer rates, enhanced analytical performance, increased sensitivity, and easy preparation . In addition, it is important to note that ZnO is relatively stable around biological pH-values, which makes ZnO compatible with biological fluids and species . Furthermore, the high isoelectric point (IEP) of ZnO (IEP 9.5) makes it a good matrix for immobilizing low IEP acidic proteins or DNA by electrostatic interactions with high binding stability . This will suit glucose oxidase (GOD) which has an IEP of 4.5 and is widely employed in most of the glucose biosensors due to its stability and high selectivity to glucose. All these advantageous properties render ZnO suitable for sensitive intracellular ion measurements and can allow for stable and reversible signals with respect to glucose concentration changes.\nIn previous investigations, we have successfully demonstrated that ZnO nanorods can be used to measure the intracellular Ca2+ and glucose concentrations in human adipocytes and frog oocytes . This has proved that ZnO nanostructures have the potential to measure intracellular biological species in living cells. However, there has been no report of using other alternative materials to improve the performance of this intracellular glucose biosensor. Many methods, such as covalent bonding , embedding , and cross-linking , have been used to immobilize GOD on different supporting materials. As compared to ZnO nanorods and nanowires, ZnO nanotubes and nanoporous material possess several interesting unique properties such as highly dispersed structure and large surface area. There have been reports on the use of tubular ZnO structures as amperometric extracellular glucose biosensors with improved performance and higher sensitivity compared to ZnO nanorods and nanowires . It has also been reported that the low IEP enzyme GOD binds well on the ZnO nanoporous material , resulting in enhanced sensitivity of the glucose biosensors.\nThe focus of the current study is to demonstrate an intracellular glucose biosensor based on a nano-honeycomb ZnO as an alternative to ZnO-nanorod-based sensors. Our main effort has been directed to the construction of tips coated with functionalized nanoflake ZnO that are selective to glucose and capable of gently penetrating the cell membrane. The new design differs from the previous ones by the introduction of a nanoflake ZnO that provides a larger surface area for the immobilization of GOD, which will lead to higher sensitivity and stability due to higher capture efficiency provided by higher surface-to-volume ratio. This offers a new simple and reliable way to measure intracellular glucose concentrations within single living cells.\nGlucose oxidase (E.C. 1.1.3.4) from Aspergillus niger 360 U/mg was purchased from BBI Enzymes (UK) Ltd. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, \u226598%), glutaraldehyde (50% solution), Nafion (5 wt%), d-(+)-glucose (99.5%), Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Borosilicate glass capillaries (sterile Femtotip II with tip inner diameter of 0.5 \u03bcm, tip outer diameter of 0.7 \u03bcm, and length of 49 mm) were purchased from Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 10 mM solution was prepared from Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4 (Sigma Aldrich) with 0.135 M NaCl and pH was adjusted to 7.4. Glucose stock solution was kept at least 24 h after preparation for mutarotation. All chemicals used (Sigma Aldrich) were of analytical reagent grade.\nHuman adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of pieces of subcutaneous adipose tissue , obtained during elective surgery at the University Hospital in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden (all patients gave their informed consent and procedures were approved by the local ethics committee). The adipocytes were incubated overnight before use as described by Str\u00e5lfors and Honor , and used in a Krebs\u2013Ringer solution buffered with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 .\nOocytes from female Xenopus laevis were obtained as previously described . In brief, a X. laevis was anesthetized in a bath with tricaine (1.4 g/L, Sigma Aldrich) and ovarian lobes were cut off through a small abdominal incision (procedure approved by the local ethics committee). Oocytes were manually dissected into smaller groups and defolliculated by enzymatic treatment with liberase (Roche Diagnostics, Sweden) for 2.5 h. Stage-III and -VI oocytes (approximately 1 mm in diameter) without spots and with clear delimitation between the animal and vegetal pole were selected. Oocytes were kept in MBS solution (in mM: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 15 HEPES, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, pH adjusted to 7.6 by NaOH) supplemented with 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 U/mL penicillin, and 25 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all from Sigma Aldrich) at 11 \u00b0C for 1\u20135 days before measurements.\nA main effort has been directed to make the tip geometry of intracellular electrodes extremely sharp (submicrometer dimension) and long enough (>10 \u03bcm) to be manipulated into small living cells.\nThe selective intracellular glucose measurements were accomplished by a potentiometric method utilizing two electrodes: (1) An Ag/AgCl electrode as the intracellular reference microelectrode, and (2) an intracellular aluminum electrode covered with nanoflake ZnO with attached enzyme molecules.\nThe reference microelectrode was prepared from a borosilicate glass capillary fixed on a flat support in the vacuum chamber of an evaporation system (Evaporator Satis CR725). First chromium and then silver (with a thickness of 10 and 125 nm, respectively) were uniformly deposited onto the outer surface of the capillary tip. The AgCl tip coating was prepared electrochemically by dipping the silver coated end of one capillary in 0.2 M HCl solution and then by electrolyzing the silver film to form AgCl by polarizing it at 1.0 V for 1 min.\nAnother borosilicate glass capillary was fixed on a flat support in the vacuum chamber of an evaporation system and titanium and aluminum (with a thickness of 10 and 200 nm, respectively) were uniformly deposited onto the outer surface of the capillary tip. After that the tip was first dipped into a seed solution for 2 min and then baked for 3 min at a temperature of 110 \u00b0C as described in Ref. . In the second step, nanoflake ZnO was grown by a hydrothermal process as described in Ref. . In brief, the growth solution contained 0.025 M Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O and 0.025 M hexamethylenetetramine. The solution was kept at 90 \u00b0C for 4 h to form nanoflake ZnO as shown in Fig. 1a. Before functionalization, the glucose-sensing microelectrode was carefully cleaned with de-ionized water and dried in the air. The electrical contact was attached to the surface of the prepared electrodes for obtaining electrical signal during measurements.\nBefore immobilization of the enzyme, the ZnO covered microelectrode was rinsed with PBS to generate a hydrophilic surface. Enzyme solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg GOD and 20 mg BSA in 200 \u03bcL PBS. The electrode was dipped into the enzyme solution for 15 min where after it was left in the air for 20 min to dry. The cross-linking procedure was carried out by adding 2 \u03bcL aqueous solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% Nafion onto the electrode surface. After drying at room temperature, 2 \u03bcL of 0.5% Nafion solution was further applied onto the electrode surface to prevent possible enzyme leakage and to eliminate foreign interferences. All enzyme-covered microelectrodes were stored in dry condition at 4 \u00b0C when not in use.\nThe morphology of ZnO was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, and the crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction. Elemental analysis was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. All the electrochemical experiments were carried out using a Metrohm pH meter model 744 (Metrohm Ltd., Switzerland). For the time response measurements, a model 363A potentiostat/galvanostat (EG&G Ltd., USA) was used.\nFig. 1a shows scanning electron microscopy images of the nanoflake ZnO grown on the tip of the borosilicate glass capillary before enzyme immobilization. As clearly seen, nano-honeycomb structures with a wall thickness around 200 nm with uniform density and spatial distribution had been formed on the tip of the electrode.\nIt has been shown in previous studies that aluminum directs the growth of the nano-honeycomb ZnO and suppresses the growth along the [0 0 1] direction . Aluminum substrates are known to favor the synthesis of ZnO nanomaterials with 2D morphology . The dissolution of aluminum is a prerequisite and since aluminum is an amphoteric metal, it can be dissolved under alkaline conditions in the presence of an amine (such as hexamethylenetetramine) forming Al(OH)4 \u2212. In addition, the additive ions usually act as regulators to promote or inhibit the growth by capping the ZnO surface . Presumably Al(OH)4 \u2212 binds to the Zn2+ terminated (0 0 1) surface suppressing the growth along [0 0 1] direction. This triggers the lateral growth that forms oriented nanoflake ZnO .\nThe X-ray diffraction pattern of the nanoflake ZnO is shown in Fig. 1b. All three peaks that belong to ZnO indicate formation of single-phase ZnO with wurtzite structure. Fig. 1c shows energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, indicating that the nano-honeycomb structure consists of Zn and O. Fig. 1d shows a scanning electron microscopy image of the nanoflake ZnO after modification with GOD and Nafion.\nThe sensing mechanism of most electrochemical glucose sensors is based on the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by GOD according to the following reaction: H2O+O2+\u03b2-d-glucose\u27f6GOD\u03b4-d-gluconolactone+H2O2 as a result of this reaction, \u03b4-d-gluconolactone and H2O2 are produced. The concentration of these two products and the oxygen consumption can be used for the glucose determination. With H2O available in the reaction, gluconolactone is spontaneously converted to gluconic acid, which at neutral pH, form the charged products of gluconate\u2212 and H+, according to the equation below: \u03b4-d-gluconolactone\u27f6spontaneousd-gluconate\u2212+H+ this protolytic reaction results in a decrease of the pH and can be used for determination of the glucose concentration . In our case, it is the resulting change in ionic distribution around the ZnO crystal structure that causes a change of the overall potential of the glucose-sensing microelectrode.\nFirst, the extracellular function of the GOD immobilized on the ZnO electrode was tested. A two-electrode configuration with the glucose-sensing and Ag/AgCl microelectrodes was employed for microliter volumes in the electrochemical measurements. The extracellular potentiometric response of the two microelectrodes was studied for calibration purpose in a buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) with glucose concentrations ranging from 500 nM to 10 mM. The response time when glucose was added to the solution was fast, reaching 95% of the steady-state potential within 4 s. A typical example of the response for 50 \u03bcM glucose is shown in Fig. 2a. The steady-state potential showed linear dependence with the logarithm of the glucose concentration over the complete glucose concentration range studied (Fig. 2b). This is an improvement over the previously proposed ZnO-nanorod-based intracellular glucose-sensing microelectrode , which failed to show linear response for glucose concentration over 1 mM. This wider range could be due to the different immobilization techniques used in the new sensor, in which immobilized GOD retained its enzymatic activity for a longer duration and the prevention of possible enzyme leakage from the electrode by the Nafion membrane coating which also reduces foreign interferences. The sensitivity of the nanoflake ZnO sensor was \u221265.2 mV/decade (Fig. 2b), which is 1.6\u20131.8 times higher sensitivity than for earlier reported glucose sensors . The higher sensitivity may be ascribed to the fact that nano-honeycomb structures provide a larger and more accessible surface area, which might lead to different enzymes coverage and a different distribution of reactants on the ZnO surface at equilibrium.\nIn order to measure the intracellular glucose concentration in a single human adipocyte, a glass slide (5 cm length, 4 cm width, and 0.17 mm thickness) with sparsely distributed human adipocytes was placed on the microscope stage. The microelectrodes, mounted on a micropipette holder of a micromanipulation system, were then gently micromanipulated into the cell using the hydraulic fine adjustments for penetrating the cell membrane and extending a short way into the cell as shown schematically in Fig. 3 . Once the microelectrodes were inside the cell, the electrochemical potential difference signal could be measured and the glucose concentration determined. The intracellular glucose concentration in a single human adipocyte was 60 \u00b1 15 \u03bcM (n = 5), corresponding well with the 70 \u03bcM intracellular concentration determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in rat muscle tissue in the presence of a high, 10 mM, extracellular glucose concentration . As soon as we got a stable potential for intracellular measurement, a 3 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM insulin was injected into the total volume of 0.25 mL of extracellular solution, and the glucose concentration in the cell increased from 60 \u00b1 15 to 130 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM (n = 5). It took a few minutes to reach the final potential for intracellular glucose uptake as shown in Fig. 4a. The increase in intracellular glucose after insulin treatment was expected because insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake as shown schematically in Fig. 4b. Insulin binds to its receptor at the cell surface. This initiates an intracellular signal-transduction causing translocation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4; encoded by the GLUT4 gene) from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane. After integration into the plasma membrane, GLUT4 allows glucose to enter the cell down a concentration gradient.\nIn the human body, the hormone insulin only stimulates glucose transport into muscle and fat cells. However, insulin has also been found to affect glucose uptake in oocytes from X. laevis . The large size of these cells makes it possible to micro-inject specific reagents that interrupt or activate signal transmission to glucose. Thus, in another set of experiment, we used the microelectrodes to measure the intracellular glucose concentration in single frog oocytes. The intracellular concentration was 110 \u00b1 20 \u03bcM (n = 5), which was slightly higher than what has been reported (<50 \u03bcM) in a previous investigation using another method . We do not know the reason for this difference, but one possibility is that the electrodes behave slightly different inside the oocyte than outside, where they were calibrated. To test if the electrode can monitor changes in the glucose concentration inside the frog oocytes, 10 nM insulin again was added to the cell medium and the glucose concentration in the frog oocytes increased from 110 \u00b1 20 to 225 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM. The increase in glucose response and stabilized on the new value could be noted within few minutes.\nThe introduction of the ZnO nanosensor into the cytoplasm of the single living cell did not visibly seem to affect cellular viability. The viability of the penetrated cells depends strongly on the size of the sensor. This study demonstrated that size of the proposed sensor made it a minimally invasive tool appropriate for monitoring glucose changes inside living cells of the actual size.\nTo obtain an accurate and reusable glucose-sensing microelectrode, parameters such as reproducibility, stability, and anti-interference were examined. Fig. 5a shows a reproducibility test of 5 independently developed ZnO nanosensor in human adipocytes. The relative standard deviation determined from this measurement was less than 5%.\nFig. 5b displays the results of three experiments for the same glucose-sensing microelectrode showing good repeatability and linearity in various glucose concentrations PBS solution (pH 7.4). The glucose-sensing microelectrode was carefully washed with de-ionized water after each measurement to clean and to remove the residual ions from the surface of the electrode.\nThe selectivity of a glucose-sensing microelectrode depends on two major factors: the enzyme analyte reaction and the selective measurements. The enzyme analyte reaction with \u03b2-d-glucose is highly specific without any major interfering reaction with other types of sugars. It could however, be useful to control for possible interferences from reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, which are well known interferents with amperometric GOD biosensors. The results are shown in Fig. 5c and clearly demonstrate that the addition of these potential interferents did not substantially change the signal. Addition of 100 \u03bcM of ascorbic acid or uric acid to 1000 \u03bcM glucose only generated some small transient signals. Also long-term measurements could be a problem because of the solubility of ZnO in aqueous solution although the solubility is lowest at neutral pH. Furthermore, the experiments described here were short and could be performed without influence of this drawback. However, if the long-term stability really is an issue it can be improved to the same level as for most other sensors in use by a thin membrane coating .\nNanoflake ZnO was grown on the tip of an aluminum-coated glass capillary to be used as basis for an intracellular glucose biosensor as an alternative to previously used ZnO nanowires. By growing the ZnO on aluminum the crystal growth was directed towards a nano-honeycomb structure well suited for electrostatic immobilization of the glucose oxidase enzyme. For increased stability and selectivity the sensing layer was protected by Nafion. The sensor was tested in measurements of glucose in human adipocytes and frog oocytes giving results consistent with the values reported in the literature. It was also possible to monitor the time course of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by the cells. The developed sensor showed reliable stability, selectivity, and reproducibility. It was insensitive to compounds known to interfere with amperometric measurements. The proposed biosensor showed a fast response within 4 s and an improved linear electrochemical response (EMF) over a wide range of glucose concentrations (500 nM\u201310 mM) as well as higher sensitivity than previous micro/nanosensor concepts. The fabrication method used for this intracellular sensor is simple and can be used to immobilize other enzymes and bio-molecular species with low isoelectric points. An advantage to potentiometric devices in intracellular measurements is that they can be tuned for very low analyte consumption, which is of particular importance in intracellular applications."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nConfirmation of identity of forensically relevant compounds and especially drugs of abuse is a necessary part of the process to decide whether an individual was under the influence of drugs during the particular event, for example medico\u2013legal event controls of people involved in crime, e.g. robberies, rapes, homicides and traffic and workplace accidents, driving under influence of drugs, etc. Because law courts rely on analytical results from toxicological analyses, the confirmation of identity of a particular drug or its metabolites in biological fluid or tissue should be objective and reliable.\nAccording to the SOFT/AAFS Forensic Laboratory Guidelines and to the guidelines of the German Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry (GTFCH) , the initial detection of drugs and other toxins should be confirmed whenever possible by a second technique based on a different chemical principle. The use of mass spectrometry is recommended as the confirmatory technique, wherever practical. However, most of the recommendations refer to GC/MS and only recently attention has been given to the LC/MS/MS technique. Because this technique is becoming intensively used for drug confirmation, there is a need to establish minimal necessary requirements for LC/MS/MS analyses. Although detailed international guidelines have been established by the EU for confirmation of veterinary drugs in residue control as well as for doping-agents by the world anti-doping agency (WADA) and by the IOC, no detailed international guidelines are available for forensic toxicology. Recently, a review article has been published where several new rules and quality assurance criteria are summarized. They concern the identification of organic molecules in biosamples taking into account the latest advances in mass spectrometry. These criteria are expressed as so called identification points (IP) that the particular method has to fulfill to ensure reliable and objective identification of the particular substance. Criteria mentioned in the review article are based on theoretical considerations and no concrete cases tested under these criteria have been presented.\nThe general criteria for any analytical procedure require that the method has to be able to distinguish between the analyte and all known interfering substances that may possibly occur in the relevant matrix. Since every analytical technique has different identification power a system of IP has been set up to characterize a particular technique. In this study we describe two LC/MS/MS methods for analysis of drugs of abuse that show different fragmentation features and present the results with respect to current recommendations and EU guidelines taking into account the criteria of \u201cminimum number of MRM transitions\u201d and the \u201crelative intensities of the transitions\u201d. As examples, we have chosen a method for determination of three forensically relevant cannabinoids \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 11-hydroxy-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and a method for the simultaneous determination of basic drugs and their metabolites: codeine, morphine, morphine-3\u03b2-d-glucuronide (M3G), normorphine, 6-O-monoacetylmorphine (MAM), benzoylecgonine (BE), heroin, lysergide (LSD), cocaine and methadone. Even though validated LC/MS methods for determination of drugs of abuse have been published, e.g. for determination of opioids in biological fluids , methadone in saliva , cocaine in urine , cocaine in several matrices , opiates and cocaine in meconium and opioids, cocaine and metabolites in urine , none of the authors has followed the recommendations concerning the necessity to use at least two MRM transition for compound identification and/or they did not take into consideration the relative intensities of diagnostic ions or transitions. Only one study describes the use of quantifiers and qualifiers for confirmation of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in urine and discusses the quality control requirements established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services . However, it seems that only quantifiers were used for validation parameters.\nOur presented methods have been validated for determination of the mentioned drugs (except of heroin and LSD) in human plasma and have been successfully applied to the identification of these drugs in blood, plasma and urine samples. At least two MRM transitions for each substance were monitored to provide sufficient identification of drugs, deuterated analogues of analytes were used as internal standards for quantitation where possible. The quantifiers were used for all validation parameters except for limit of detection (LOD); for calculation of LOD the qualifiers (with \u03b1-error 10%) were used as suggested by the guidelines of the GTFCh for the confirmatory analysis of the drugs of abuse.\nStandard solutions of codeine (1 mg/ml), morphine (100 \u03bcg/ml), M3G (100 \u03bcg/ml), normorphine (1 mg/ml), MAM (1 mg/ml), BE (100 \u03bcg/ml), heroin (100 \u03bcg/ml), LSD (1 mg/ml), cocaine (1 mg/ml), methadone (100 \u03bcg/ml), THC (1 mg/ml), 11-OH-THC (100 \u03bcg/ml), THC-COOH (1 mg/ml) and deuterated analogues (100 \u03bcg/ml) used as internal standards (IS) in methanol were obtained from Promochem/Radian (Wesel, Germany). Acetonitrile (HPLC gradient grade), all solvents for SPE (analytical grade), ammonium carbonate (p.a.), ammonium formate (p.a.) and ammonium acetate (p.a.) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). SPE cartridges Chromabond C18 (3 ml/500 mg) for extraction of cannabinoids and Chromabond C18 (3 ml/200 mg) for extraction of basic drugs were supplied by Macherey-Nagel (D\u00fcren, Germany). Deionized water was prepared on a cartridge-deionizer from Memtech (Moorenweis, Germany).\nSPE was performed with a Zymark RapidTrace SPE Workstation (Zymark, Idstein, Germany). For the evaporation of the extracts the speed vacuum concentrator (Alpha RVC, Martin Christ, Osterode, Germany) was used.\nIn case of cannabinoid analysis LC/MS/MS system consisted of an API 3000\u2122 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Turbo IonSpray interface and LINAC\u2122 collision cell (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Langen, Germany) and Series 200 LC Plus system (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). Analytes were separated at 40 \u00b0C on a Luna 3\u03bc PhenylHexyl column 50 mm \u00d7 2 mm, 3 \u03bcm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) fitted up with guard cartridge Polar-RP, 4 mm \u00d7 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using gradient elution of 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) (A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and the gradient was: 0\u20130.4 min: 30% B; 0.4\u20137.8 min: linear from 30% to 90% B; 7.8\u20138.2 min: 90% B; 8.2\u20138.5 min: linear from 90% to 30% B; 8.5\u201311 min: 30% B. Detailed description of MS/MS conditions and MS/MS spectra for selection of MRM transitions are published elsewhere .\nIn case of basic drugs analysis, LC/MS/MS system consisted of an API 365\u2122 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Turbo IonSpray interface (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Langen, Germany) two HPLC pumps Shimadzu-LC-10AD VP and controller SCL 10Avp (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany). Analytes were separated at 40 \u00b0C on a Synergi Hydro-RP column 150 mm \u00d7 2 mm, 3 \u03bcm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) fitted up with guard cartridge Polar-RP 4 mm \u00d7 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using gradient elution of 4 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.6) (A) and acetonitrile (B) and post column addition of acetonitrile (0.05 ml/min). The mobile phase flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and the gradient was: 0\u20131 min: 0% B; 1\u201313 min: linear from 0% to 60% B; 13\u201315 min: 60% B; 15\u201317 min: linear from 60% to 0% B; 17\u201323 min: 0% B. MS conditions were as follows: TurboIonSpray gas, 4 l/min; nebulizer gas (NEB), 69 kPa; curtain gas (CUR), 76 kPa; collision gas (CAD), 28 kPa; IonSpray voltage (IS), 5250 V; temperature (TEM), 350 \u00b0C; focusing potential (FP), 230 V; dwell time, 0.05 s; entrance potential (EP), 10 V; collision cell exit potential (CXP), 15 V; declustering potential (DP), 20 V; collision energies (CE) for particular MRM transitions are mentioned in Table 3 .\nPositive electrospray ionisation was used in all cases and all analyses were performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) .\nFor validation of both methods two series of nine calibration standards were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma. The validation of linearity, accuracy and precision were done by Quantitation Wizard of the Analyst\u00ae software. The program for statistical data evaluation B.E.N. Version 2.0 was used for calculation of limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ). Six different sources of blank plasma were tested for matrix interferences. For determination of relative intensities of ion ratios (qualifier-to-quantifier) and determination of percent deviations of relative intensities of MRM transitions for basic drugs duplicate analysis of six different plasma samples spiked with 5 and 50 ng/ml were performed on two separate days. For calculation of relative intensities of ion ratios (qualifier-to-quantifier) and determination of percent deviations of relative intensities of MRM transitions for cannabinoids the same calibration samples were used as for the LOD and LOQ determination.\nThe stock solutions of cannabinoids (1 \u03bcg/ml and 100 ng/ml for THC and 11-OH-THC, 5 \u03bcg/ml and 500 ng/ml for THC-COOH; and mixture of deuterated analogues 1 \u03bcg/ml THC-d3, 1 \u03bcg/ml 11-OH-THC-d3, 5 \u03bcg/ml THC-COOH-d3) were prepared by diluting the standard solution of drugs in methanol. Two series of calibration standards were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma. The concentration in plasma calibration standards were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100 ng/ml for THC and 11-OH-THC and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 250, 500 ng/ml for THC-COOH. The validation included also blank plasma samples. Sets of five quality control samples at two concentration levels (8 and 20 ng/ml of THC and 11-OH-THC, 15 and 40 ng/ml of THC-COOH) were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma and were used to determine the accuracy and the precision of the method. Linear regressions with equidistant calibration levels (0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ng/ml for THC and 11-OH-THC and 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ng/ml for THC-COOH) were used for the calculation of LOD and LOQ with a relative uncertainty of 33% (k = 3) .\nAliquots (10 \u03bcl) of deuterated standard-mix stock solution were added into every sample (calibration, quality control, real sample) in the beginning of the sample preparation process. Two millilitres of 0.1 M acetic acid was added into 1 ml of sample and this mixture was vortex-mixed for 20 s. This solution was applied onto preconditioned SPE cartridge for extraction. Detailed SPE program of Zymark RapidTrace SPE-Automat is published elsewhere . The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a speed vacuum concentrator at 40 \u00b0C, 500 Pa. The residue was reconstituted in 100 \u03bcl of the HPLC mobile phase (70% 5 mM ammonium acetate and 30% acetonitrile) and 20 \u03bcl aliquots were injected for LC/MS/MS analysis.\nThe stock solutions of drugs (1 \u03bcg/ml and 100 ng/ml each; 1 \u03bcg/ml of deuterated analogues) were prepared by diluting the standard solution of drugs in methanol. Two series of nine calibration standards were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma to cover the concentration range 1\u2013250 ng/ml for normorphine, morphine and M3G; 1\u2013250 ng/ml for codeine and MAM; 1\u2013500 ng/ml for BE and methadone; 2\u2013500 ng/ml for cocaine. Sets of five quality control samples at two concentration levels (summarized in Table 2 ) were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma as well and were used to determine the accuracy and the precision of the method. Linear regressions with following calibration levels were used for the calculation of LOD and LOQ with a relative uncertainty of 33% (k = 3) : 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 ng/ml for normorphine, morphine and M3G; 0,1, 2, 3, 5, 10 ng/ml for codeine and MAM; 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ng/ml for cocaine, BE and methadone.\nAliquots (20 \u03bcl) of deuterated standards stock solution were added into every sample (calibration, quality control, real sample) in the beginning of the sample preparation process. Two millilitres of 4 mM ammonium carbonate buffer (AC buffer) (pH 9.4) were added into 1 ml of sample and this mixture was vortex-mixed for 20 s. This solution was applied onto preconditioned SPE cartridge for extraction. The operation program of automated SPE was as described in Table 1 . The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a speed vacuum concentrator at 40 \u00b0C, 500 Pa. The residue was reconstituted in 100 \u03bcl of the HPLC mobile phase (4 mM ammonium acetate) and 20 \u03bcl aliquots were injected for LC/MS/MS analysis.\nThe MRM transitions of basic drugs have been chosen based on measurement of product ion spectra (MS/MS) (Fig. 1 ) at three different collision energies (CE) to ensure different fragmentation of compounds. Three collisions energies 20, 35, 50 eV have been chosen for responding to already existing MS/MS libraries . Selection of MRM transitions of cannabinoids has already been published , MRM transition for THC-COOHglu m/z 521 \u2192 345, 345 \u2192 327 have been chosen according to the literature and the transitions for codeine\u2013glucuronide m/z 476 \u2192 300, 476 \u2192 215 were based on theoretical calculations that opiate-glucuronides fragment yielding an ion [M \u2212 176]+. The chosen MRM transitions are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 3. The most prominent MRM transitions were used for quantification and the other ones were used as so called qualifiers, except of opioids. Here, the unfragmented precursor ions were used for quantification. The transitions for deuterated analogues were m/z 348 \u2192 330 for THC-COOH-d3, m/z 334 \u2192 316 for 11-OH-THC-d3, m/z 318 \u2192 196 for THC-d3, m/z 303 \u2192 303 for codeine-d3, m/z 289 \u2192 289 for morphine-d3, m/z 331 \u2192 168 for MAM-d3, m/z 465 \u2192 465 for M3G-d3, m/z 293 \u2192171 for BE-d3, m/z 307 \u2192 185 for cocaine-d3, m/z 313 \u2192 268 for methadone-d3. The validation parameters for particular compounds are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The validation for LSD has not been performed because the developed SPE method has proved to be unsuitable for LSD isolation. The linear regression model was used to calculate regression lines. The relative intensities of selected MRM transitions are summarized together with particular collision energies in Table 3 and corresponding LODs and LOQs are shown here as well. The relative intensities are presented in percent of the intensity of corresponding quantifier (the most abundant MRM transition) and the percent deviation of relative intensites. The percent deviations of relative intensities of MRM transitions for basic drugs were determined from 12 measurements at concentrations 5 and 50 ng/ml and the results for 5 ng/ml are shown in Table 3. However, the results for MRM intensities at 50 ng/ml were in the same ranges. For identification of codeine, morphine, M3G and normorphine two qualifiers have been used because the quantitation of these have been done with the unfragmented precursor ions. It is also apparent from results in Table 3 that the relative intensities of qualifiers vary significantly for selected drugs. However, the results (LOD) are satisfactory for all substances, also for those such as morphine and codeine that have very low intensities of MRM transition used as qualifiers.\nAs was already mentioned criteria that the particular method has to fulfill to ensure reliable and objective identification of the particular substance are expressed as so called identification points (IP). Examples of this IP attributed to some methods are shown in Table 4 . Generally two multiple reaction monitoring (MRM transitions) transitions (correspond to three diagnostic ions) are required using LC/MS/MS method, first one (usually the most intensive) as so called \u201cquantifier\u201d and the second one as so called \u201cqualifier\u201d for confirmation of identity of substance. This gives for our developed methods four IP. Table 5 shows then the required relative intensities of the detected ions using various LC/MS/(MS) techniques expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the most intense ion or transition. Comparing required relative intensities stated in Table 5 with our results mentioned in Table 3, it is apparent that our LC/MS/MS methods easy fulfill criteria for permitted relative intensities of MRM transitions.\nLC/MS/MS chromatograms of studied drugs are shown in Fig. 2. The most intense peak corresponds to the quantifier (most intense MRM transition) and the other ones to qualifiers.\nIn case of cannabinoids the influence of mobile phase was studied. Fig. 3 shows chromatograms of standard mixtures obtained by using mobile phases with different pH. No bigger differences have been observed for 11-OH-THC when using mobile phase I. (A) 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 2.7) and as (B) acetonitrile with 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 5.5) or mobile phase II: (A) 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) and (B) acetonitrile, but on the other hand, the analysis and ionization of THC-COOH and especially THC have been influenced by the pH of mobile phase more significantly. The peak areas of analytes were approximately 1.3\u00d7 smaller for 11-OH-THC, 2\u00d7 for THC-COOH and 6.5\u00d7 for THC when using more acidic mobile phase I. As can be seen (Fig. 3), there was practically no separation of 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH using these conditions.\nThe method developed for basic drugs shows very good selectivity. As an example one of the six different blank plasma samples is shown in Fig. 4 and a calibration plasma sample spiked at level 10 ng/ml is shown here as well. No matrix interferences have been observed during any other analysis. Examples of analysis of real case samples are illustrated in Fig. 5 . These show chromatograms of urine sample after heroin and cocaine intake and urine sample after codeine intake. The second example demonstrates the possibility of application of this method for the identification of codeine\u2013glucuronide, the major phase-II-metabolite of codeine. Ion suppression effects, which have been reported to be a problem in some cases with ESI of drugs and have been investigated in several studies, were not further investigated here. It was because the deuterated internal analogues of the analytes were used for quantification and good linearity was found throughout the calibration range for every analyte.\nLC/MS/MS is a very powerful analytical tool for confirmatory analysis of drugs of abuse especially of polar, thermally labile and not volatile compounds and their metabolites. However, only the most recent criteria concerning confirmation of identity of substances in forensic toxicology also take into consideration LC/MS and LC/MS/MS methods. We have presented two validated methods taking into account recently established criteria for confirmation of identity using LC/MS/MS. Presented methods can fulfill the requirement for a minimum of four identification points with two MRM transitions for confirmation of compound identity. Furthermore, the requirements of the EU guidelines concerning the variability of relative ion intensities of the MRM transitions could be met by these methods even at low analyte concentrations. Both methods are sufficiently sensitive to fulfill current recommendations of the German Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry for confirmatory analysis of drugs of abuse in driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) cases. Furthermore, they can also be used for the fast and simultaneous detection of illegal drugs in drug related deaths.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Confirmation of identity of forensically relevant compounds and especially drugs of abuse is a necessary part of the process to decide whether an individual was under the influence of drugs during the particular event, for example medico\u2013legal event controls of people involved in crime, e.g. robberies, rapes, homicides and traffic and workplace accidents, driving under influence of drugs, etc. Because law courts rely on analytical results from toxicological analyses, the confirmation of identity of a particular drug or its metabolites in biological fluid or tissue should be objective and reliable.\nAccording to the SOFT/AAFS Forensic Laboratory Guidelines and to the guidelines of the German Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry (GTFCH) , the initial detection of drugs and other toxins should be confirmed whenever possible by a second technique based on a different chemical principle. The use of mass spectrometry is recommended as the confirmatory technique, wherever practical. However, most of the recommendations refer to GC/MS and only recently attention has been given to the LC/MS/MS technique. Because this technique is becoming intensively used for drug confirmation, there is a need to establish minimal necessary requirements for LC/MS/MS analyses. Although detailed international guidelines have been established by the EU for confirmation of veterinary drugs in residue control as well as for doping-agents by the world anti-doping agency (WADA) and by the IOC, no detailed international guidelines are available for forensic toxicology. Recently, a review article has been published where several new rules and quality assurance criteria are summarized. They concern the identification of organic molecules in biosamples taking into account the latest advances in mass spectrometry. These criteria are expressed as so called identification points (IP) that the particular method has to fulfill to ensure reliable and objective identification of the particular substance. Criteria mentioned in the review article are based on theoretical considerations and no concrete cases tested under these criteria have been presented.\nThe general criteria for any analytical procedure require that the method has to be able to distinguish between the analyte and all known interfering substances that may possibly occur in the relevant matrix. Since every analytical technique has different identification power a system of IP has been set up to characterize a particular technique. In this study we describe two LC/MS/MS methods for analysis of drugs of abuse that show different fragmentation features and present the results with respect to current recommendations and EU guidelines taking into account the criteria of \u201cminimum number of MRM transitions\u201d and the \u201crelative intensities of the transitions\u201d. As examples, we have chosen a method for determination of three forensically relevant cannabinoids \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 11-hydroxy-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and a method for the simultaneous determination of basic drugs and their metabolites: codeine, morphine, morphine-3\u03b2-d-glucuronide (M3G), normorphine, 6-O-monoacetylmorphine (MAM), benzoylecgonine (BE), heroin, lysergide (LSD), cocaine and methadone. Even though validated LC/MS methods for determination of drugs of abuse have been published, e.g. for determination of opioids in biological fluids , methadone in saliva , cocaine in urine , cocaine in several matrices , opiates and cocaine in meconium and opioids, cocaine and metabolites in urine , none of the authors has followed the recommendations concerning the necessity to use at least two MRM transition for compound identification and/or they did not take into consideration the relative intensities of diagnostic ions or transitions. Only one study describes the use of quantifiers and qualifiers for confirmation of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in urine and discusses the quality control requirements established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services . However, it seems that only quantifiers were used for validation parameters.\nOur presented methods have been validated for determination of the mentioned drugs (except of heroin and LSD) in human plasma and have been successfully applied to the identification of these drugs in blood, plasma and urine samples. At least two MRM transitions for each substance were monitored to provide sufficient identification of drugs, deuterated analogues of analytes were used as internal standards for quantitation where possible. The quantifiers were used for all validation parameters except for limit of detection (LOD); for calculation of LOD the qualifiers (with \u03b1-error 10%) were used as suggested by the guidelines of the GTFCh for the confirmatory analysis of the drugs of abuse.\nStandard solutions of codeine (1 mg/ml), morphine (100 \u03bcg/ml), M3G (100 \u03bcg/ml), normorphine (1 mg/ml), MAM (1 mg/ml), BE (100 \u03bcg/ml), heroin (100 \u03bcg/ml), LSD (1 mg/ml), cocaine (1 mg/ml), methadone (100 \u03bcg/ml), THC (1 mg/ml), 11-OH-THC (100 \u03bcg/ml), THC-COOH (1 mg/ml) and deuterated analogues (100 \u03bcg/ml) used as internal standards (IS) in methanol were obtained from Promochem/Radian (Wesel, Germany). Acetonitrile (HPLC gradient grade), all solvents for SPE (analytical grade), ammonium carbonate (p.a.), ammonium formate (p.a.) and ammonium acetate (p.a.) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). SPE cartridges Chromabond C18 (3 ml/500 mg) for extraction of cannabinoids and Chromabond C18 (3 ml/200 mg) for extraction of basic drugs were supplied by Macherey-Nagel (D\u00fcren, Germany). Deionized water was prepared on a cartridge-deionizer from Memtech (Moorenweis, Germany).\nSPE was performed with a Zymark RapidTrace SPE Workstation (Zymark, Idstein, Germany). For the evaporation of the extracts the speed vacuum concentrator (Alpha RVC, Martin Christ, Osterode, Germany) was used.\nIn case of cannabinoid analysis LC/MS/MS system consisted of an API 3000\u2122 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Turbo IonSpray interface and LINAC\u2122 collision cell (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Langen, Germany) and Series 200 LC Plus system (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). Analytes were separated at 40 \u00b0C on a Luna 3\u03bc PhenylHexyl column 50 mm \u00d7 2 mm, 3 \u03bcm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) fitted up with guard cartridge Polar-RP, 4 mm \u00d7 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using gradient elution of 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) (A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and the gradient was: 0\u20130.4 min: 30% B; 0.4\u20137.8 min: linear from 30% to 90% B; 7.8\u20138.2 min: 90% B; 8.2\u20138.5 min: linear from 90% to 30% B; 8.5\u201311 min: 30% B. Detailed description of MS/MS conditions and MS/MS spectra for selection of MRM transitions are published elsewhere .\nIn case of basic drugs analysis, LC/MS/MS system consisted of an API 365\u2122 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Turbo IonSpray interface (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Langen, Germany) two HPLC pumps Shimadzu-LC-10AD VP and controller SCL 10Avp (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany). Analytes were separated at 40 \u00b0C on a Synergi Hydro-RP column 150 mm \u00d7 2 mm, 3 \u03bcm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) fitted up with guard cartridge Polar-RP 4 mm \u00d7 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using gradient elution of 4 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.6) (A) and acetonitrile (B) and post column addition of acetonitrile (0.05 ml/min). The mobile phase flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and the gradient was: 0\u20131 min: 0% B; 1\u201313 min: linear from 0% to 60% B; 13\u201315 min: 60% B; 15\u201317 min: linear from 60% to 0% B; 17\u201323 min: 0% B. MS conditions were as follows: TurboIonSpray gas, 4 l/min; nebulizer gas (NEB), 69 kPa; curtain gas (CUR), 76 kPa; collision gas (CAD), 28 kPa; IonSpray voltage (IS), 5250 V; temperature (TEM), 350 \u00b0C; focusing potential (FP), 230 V; dwell time, 0.05 s; entrance potential (EP), 10 V; collision cell exit potential (CXP), 15 V; declustering potential (DP), 20 V; collision energies (CE) for particular MRM transitions are mentioned in Table 3 .\nPositive electrospray ionisation was used in all cases and all analyses were performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) .\nFor validation of both methods two series of nine calibration standards were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma. The validation of linearity, accuracy and precision were done by Quantitation Wizard of the Analyst\u00ae software. The program for statistical data evaluation B.E.N. Version 2.0 was used for calculation of limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ). Six different sources of blank plasma were tested for matrix interferences. For determination of relative intensities of ion ratios (qualifier-to-quantifier) and determination of percent deviations of relative intensities of MRM transitions for basic drugs duplicate analysis of six different plasma samples spiked with 5 and 50 ng/ml were performed on two separate days. For calculation of relative intensities of ion ratios (qualifier-to-quantifier) and determination of percent deviations of relative intensities of MRM transitions for cannabinoids the same calibration samples were used as for the LOD and LOQ determination.\nThe stock solutions of cannabinoids (1 \u03bcg/ml and 100 ng/ml for THC and 11-OH-THC, 5 \u03bcg/ml and 500 ng/ml for THC-COOH; and mixture of deuterated analogues 1 \u03bcg/ml THC-d3, 1 \u03bcg/ml 11-OH-THC-d3, 5 \u03bcg/ml THC-COOH-d3) were prepared by diluting the standard solution of drugs in methanol. Two series of calibration standards were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma. The concentration in plasma calibration standards were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100 ng/ml for THC and 11-OH-THC and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 250, 500 ng/ml for THC-COOH. The validation included also blank plasma samples. Sets of five quality control samples at two concentration levels (8 and 20 ng/ml of THC and 11-OH-THC, 15 and 40 ng/ml of THC-COOH) were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma and were used to determine the accuracy and the precision of the method. Linear regressions with equidistant calibration levels (0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ng/ml for THC and 11-OH-THC and 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ng/ml for THC-COOH) were used for the calculation of LOD and LOQ with a relative uncertainty of 33% (k = 3) .\nAliquots (10 \u03bcl) of deuterated standard-mix stock solution were added into every sample (calibration, quality control, real sample) in the beginning of the sample preparation process. Two millilitres of 0.1 M acetic acid was added into 1 ml of sample and this mixture was vortex-mixed for 20 s. This solution was applied onto preconditioned SPE cartridge for extraction. Detailed SPE program of Zymark RapidTrace SPE-Automat is published elsewhere . The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a speed vacuum concentrator at 40 \u00b0C, 500 Pa. The residue was reconstituted in 100 \u03bcl of the HPLC mobile phase (70% 5 mM ammonium acetate and 30% acetonitrile) and 20 \u03bcl aliquots were injected for LC/MS/MS analysis.\nThe stock solutions of drugs (1 \u03bcg/ml and 100 ng/ml each; 1 \u03bcg/ml of deuterated analogues) were prepared by diluting the standard solution of drugs in methanol. Two series of nine calibration standards were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma to cover the concentration range 1\u2013250 ng/ml for normorphine, morphine and M3G; 1\u2013250 ng/ml for codeine and MAM; 1\u2013500 ng/ml for BE and methadone; 2\u2013500 ng/ml for cocaine. Sets of five quality control samples at two concentration levels (summarized in Table 2 ) were prepared by adding aliquots of stock solution into 1 ml of drug-free plasma as well and were used to determine the accuracy and the precision of the method. Linear regressions with following calibration levels were used for the calculation of LOD and LOQ with a relative uncertainty of 33% (k = 3) : 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 ng/ml for normorphine, morphine and M3G; 0,1, 2, 3, 5, 10 ng/ml for codeine and MAM; 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ng/ml for cocaine, BE and methadone.\nAliquots (20 \u03bcl) of deuterated standards stock solution were added into every sample (calibration, quality control, real sample) in the beginning of the sample preparation process. Two millilitres of 4 mM ammonium carbonate buffer (AC buffer) (pH 9.4) were added into 1 ml of sample and this mixture was vortex-mixed for 20 s. This solution was applied onto preconditioned SPE cartridge for extraction. The operation program of automated SPE was as described in Table 1 . The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a speed vacuum concentrator at 40 \u00b0C, 500 Pa. The residue was reconstituted in 100 \u03bcl of the HPLC mobile phase (4 mM ammonium acetate) and 20 \u03bcl aliquots were injected for LC/MS/MS analysis.\nThe MRM transitions of basic drugs have been chosen based on measurement of product ion spectra (MS/MS) (Fig. 1 ) at three different collision energies (CE) to ensure different fragmentation of compounds. Three collisions energies 20, 35, 50 eV have been chosen for responding to already existing MS/MS libraries . Selection of MRM transitions of cannabinoids has already been published , MRM transition for THC-COOHglu m/z 521 \u2192 345, 345 \u2192 327 have been chosen according to the literature and the transitions for codeine\u2013glucuronide m/z 476 \u2192 300, 476 \u2192 215 were based on theoretical calculations that opiate-glucuronides fragment yielding an ion [M \u2212 176]+. The chosen MRM transitions are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 3. The most prominent MRM transitions were used for quantification and the other ones were used as so called qualifiers, except of opioids. Here, the unfragmented precursor ions were used for quantification. The transitions for deuterated analogues were m/z 348 \u2192 330 for THC-COOH-d3, m/z 334 \u2192 316 for 11-OH-THC-d3, m/z 318 \u2192 196 for THC-d3, m/z 303 \u2192 303 for codeine-d3, m/z 289 \u2192 289 for morphine-d3, m/z 331 \u2192 168 for MAM-d3, m/z 465 \u2192 465 for M3G-d3, m/z 293 \u2192171 for BE-d3, m/z 307 \u2192 185 for cocaine-d3, m/z 313 \u2192 268 for methadone-d3. The validation parameters for particular compounds are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The validation for LSD has not been performed because the developed SPE method has proved to be unsuitable for LSD isolation. The linear regression model was used to calculate regression lines. The relative intensities of selected MRM transitions are summarized together with particular collision energies in Table 3 and corresponding LODs and LOQs are shown here as well. The relative intensities are presented in percent of the intensity of corresponding quantifier (the most abundant MRM transition) and the percent deviation of relative intensites. The percent deviations of relative intensities of MRM transitions for basic drugs were determined from 12 measurements at concentrations 5 and 50 ng/ml and the results for 5 ng/ml are shown in Table 3. However, the results for MRM intensities at 50 ng/ml were in the same ranges. For identification of codeine, morphine, M3G and normorphine two qualifiers have been used because the quantitation of these have been done with the unfragmented precursor ions. It is also apparent from results in Table 3 that the relative intensities of qualifiers vary significantly for selected drugs. However, the results (LOD) are satisfactory for all substances, also for those such as morphine and codeine that have very low intensities of MRM transition used as qualifiers.\nAs was already mentioned criteria that the particular method has to fulfill to ensure reliable and objective identification of the particular substance are expressed as so called identification points (IP). Examples of this IP attributed to some methods are shown in Table 4 . Generally two multiple reaction monitoring (MRM transitions) transitions (correspond to three diagnostic ions) are required using LC/MS/MS method, first one (usually the most intensive) as so called \u201cquantifier\u201d and the second one as so called \u201cqualifier\u201d for confirmation of identity of substance. This gives for our developed methods four IP. Table 5 shows then the required relative intensities of the detected ions using various LC/MS/(MS) techniques expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the most intense ion or transition. Comparing required relative intensities stated in Table 5 with our results mentioned in Table 3, it is apparent that our LC/MS/MS methods easy fulfill criteria for permitted relative intensities of MRM transitions.\nLC/MS/MS chromatograms of studied drugs are shown in Fig. 2. The most intense peak corresponds to the quantifier (most intense MRM transition) and the other ones to qualifiers.\nIn case of cannabinoids the influence of mobile phase was studied. Fig. 3 shows chromatograms of standard mixtures obtained by using mobile phases with different pH. No bigger differences have been observed for 11-OH-THC when using mobile phase I. (A) 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 2.7) and as (B) acetonitrile with 1 mM ammonium formate (pH 5.5) or mobile phase II: (A) 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) and (B) acetonitrile, but on the other hand, the analysis and ionization of THC-COOH and especially THC have been influenced by the pH of mobile phase more significantly. The peak areas of analytes were approximately 1.3\u00d7 smaller for 11-OH-THC, 2\u00d7 for THC-COOH and 6.5\u00d7 for THC when using more acidic mobile phase I. As can be seen (Fig. 3), there was practically no separation of 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH using these conditions.\nThe method developed for basic drugs shows very good selectivity. As an example one of the six different blank plasma samples is shown in Fig. 4 and a calibration plasma sample spiked at level 10 ng/ml is shown here as well. No matrix interferences have been observed during any other analysis. Examples of analysis of real case samples are illustrated in Fig. 5 . These show chromatograms of urine sample after heroin and cocaine intake and urine sample after codeine intake. The second example demonstrates the possibility of application of this method for the identification of codeine\u2013glucuronide, the major phase-II-metabolite of codeine. Ion suppression effects, which have been reported to be a problem in some cases with ESI of drugs and have been investigated in several studies, were not further investigated here. It was because the deuterated internal analogues of the analytes were used for quantification and good linearity was found throughout the calibration range for every analyte.\nLC/MS/MS is a very powerful analytical tool for confirmatory analysis of drugs of abuse especially of polar, thermally labile and not volatile compounds and their metabolites. However, only the most recent criteria concerning confirmation of identity of substances in forensic toxicology also take into consideration LC/MS and LC/MS/MS methods. We have presented two validated methods taking into account recently established criteria for confirmation of identity using LC/MS/MS. Presented methods can fulfill the requirement for a minimum of four identification points with two MRM transitions for confirmation of compound identity. Furthermore, the requirements of the EU guidelines concerning the variability of relative ion intensities of the MRM transitions could be met by these methods even at low analyte concentrations. Both methods are sufficiently sensitive to fulfill current recommendations of the German Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry for confirmatory analysis of drugs of abuse in driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) cases. Furthermore, they can also be used for the fast and simultaneous detection of illegal drugs in drug related deaths."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nAmong various carbon nanostructures, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have recently attracted a great interest in diverse application areas owing to their unique characteristics such as excellent chemical/mechanical stability and possibility of mass production . Especially, CNFs are promising candidate materials for hydrogen storage devices , electronic components , catalysts and catalytic supports , bioanalytical tools , functional nanocomposites , field emission devices , and substitutes for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) . Such a recent outburst of CNF-based study may originate from their chemical similarity to fullerenes and CNTs. Moreover, CNFs are distinctive high-surface-area materials that can expose exclusively either basal graphite planes or edge planes. Despite of these advantages, a little research has been so far done on the development of CNF-based sensors due to their inherent chemical and environmental stability .\nConducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline, and polythiophene have exhibited beneficial properties attributed to their characteristic \u03c0-electron conjugation system . In particular, the oxidation level of conducting polymers can be easily tuned by the doping/dedoping (oxidation/reduction) mechanism. Thus, conducting polymers are sensitive to specific chemical/biological species, and they are also capable of showing an improved performance as chemical sensors . As a typical example, PPy has been extensively utilized as a sensing element to recognize various analytes. PPy can be easily synthesized and possesses its inherent advantages such as a low band gap, tunable electrical conductivity, environmental stability and electrochromic properties . PPy is capable of presenting noticeable responses to different types of chemical vapors, including acids, bases, alcohols, and alkanes via distinctive response mechanisms .\nWhen CNF is combined with PPy, the CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables may provide an enhanced performance with mechanical durability and improved electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the ultrathin and uniform deposition of a PPy layer (<100 nm) onto the CNF surface can furnish excellent environmental stability, tunable surface property, and enhanced sensitivity. Accordingly, the resulting CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables are expected to exhibit an improved sensor performance compared with single pristine CNF or PPy.\nFrom the viewpoint of uniform and ultrathin polymer coating, vapor deposition polymerization (VDP) provides the polymerization step of vaporized monomers under a vacuum condition and forms the polymer ultrathin layer onto the curved CNF surface. This VDP method may be applicable to surface modification, promotion of adhesion to substrate, and coating of polymeric materials on complicated geometries . Until now, a considerable effort has been devoted toward efficient detection of irritant and toxic gases such as ammonia (NH3), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and NOx for human health and environment protection . Representatively, PPy has been widely exploited as an NH3 sensor . In contrast, detection of HCl has been mainly achieved by polyaniline or its derivatives, because these materials are readily doped with HCl . Meanwhile, CNT/polymer hybrids have been utilized for detection of both NH3 and HCl . However, incorporation of CNF-based materials into a toxic gas sensor has not yet been explored. Accordingly, the motivation of this study is to deposit a uniform and ultrathin PPy layer onto the CNF surface by a one-step VDP method and to investigate the feasibility of CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables as a highly sensitive sensor. This work is a first experimental demonstration for realization of an efficient toxic gas sensor based on the CNF/conducting polymer hybrid. In addition, the chemical response of CNFs encapsulated with PPy was also evaluated with variation in thickness of the PPy layer.\nCNFs with an average diameter of 50 nm were synthesized according to a well-established method, as described in the next section. Fig. 1 exhibits the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the CNFs employed in this work. The detailed preparation conditions and physical properties of the CNF were summarized in Table 1 . Pyrrole (Py) monomer was purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and used without further purification . Iron(III) chloride as a redox initiator was also purchased from Aldrich and employed as received.\nCNFs were prepared from a mixed gas of carbon monoxide, ethylene and hydrogen (CO/C2H2/H2 = 2/2/1, v/v/v) on a non-supported iron catalyst at 600 \u00b0C using a conventional horizontal tube furnace . The iron catalyst powder used was prepared via precipitation of ferric carbonate by adding ammonium bicarbonate, as described by Best and Russell . The precipitate was dried overnight in an oven at 100 \u00b0C and then calcined in air at 400 \u00b0C for 5 h to convert the carbonate into oxide. The calcined oxide was reduced in a 10% H2/He mixture for 20 h at 480 \u00b0C. The reduced catalyst was subsequently cooled to ambient temperature in a helium atmosphere before being passivated in a 5% Air/He mixture for 1 h at room temperature. The passivated catalyst was then removed from the reactor and stored for later use. A quartz flow reactor for the preparation of CNFs was heated in a conventional horizontal tube furnace. The gas flow to the reactor was precisely monitored and regulated with MKS mass flow controllers. The powdered catalyst (30 mg) was placed in a quartz boat at the center of the reactor tube in the furnace. After reduction in a 10% H2/He mixture for 2 h at the prescribed temperature, helium was flushed for 0.5 h. The reactant gas mixture of CO/C2H2/H2 (2/2/1, v/v/v) was then allowed to flow over the catalyst for 1 h. The total amount of carbon deposited for 1 h on stream was determined gravimetrically after the system was cooled to ambient temperature. The prepared carbon was partially oxidized at 450 \u00b0C for 30 min under an air flow (100 mL/min) using the same type of horizontal furnace to remove amorphous carbons on the CNF surface. Hydrogen (99.999%), carbon monoxide (99.9%) and He (99.99%) were obtained from MG industries and used without further purification. Reagent grade iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O), was obtained from Wako Chemical Co.\nThe schematic diagram of the VDP procedure was illustrated in Fig. 2 . A reactor for the VDP by connecting two flasks. The total volume of the reactor was about 100 mL. CNFs (0.1 g) were soaked in an initiator solution (0.1 g FeCl3 in 1 mL water). After thoroughly wetting the CNFs, they were dried and moved into one chamber of the reactor equipped with a sealing apparatus. The reactor was evacuated at room temperature, and the vacuum valve was closed to obtain a static vacuum (0.1 Torr) inside the chamber. Subsequently, liquid pyrrole (Py, 0.05\u20130.3 mL) was introduced into the other chamber of the reactor. The Py was completely vaporized with heating at 70 \u00b0C. The VDP proceeded for 24 h at 70 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of the vaporized monomer. After polymerization, the residual monomer vapor was removed from the reactor by venting. A control experiment was performed with 0.1 g CNF, 0.2 mL Py monomer, and 0.1 g FeCl3 in a 1 mL water solution as an initiator at 70 \u00b0C under 0.1 Torr for 24 h.\nDiffused reflected infrared (DRIFT) spectra were recorded on a Bomem MB 100 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm\u22121 with 128 scans. Images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were taken with JEOL JEM-200CX at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, and the samples diluted in ethanol were cast onto a copper grid. Photographs of SEM were obtained with JEOL 6700. A microarray consisting of a pair of gold interdigitated electrodes with 80 fingers (dimensions: 10 \u03bcm spacing, 4 mm length, 50 nm thickness) was patterned on a glass substrate through photolithography . Fig. 3 illustrates the side view of a sensor substrate consisting of the microelectrodes and CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables. An ethanol solution (0.1 mL) containing 10 wt.% of PPy-coated CNFs was dropped onto the substrate. Then, the PPy-coated CNFs were deposited by spin coating on the substrate for 30 s at 3000 rpm. The substrate was allowed to dry in a vacuum oven to evaporate the residual solvent. The resistance changes of the PPy-coated CNFs were measured at room temperature with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter connected to a computer. The sensor substrate was placed in a 300 mL vacuum chamber with a vapor inlet/outlet maintained at \u223c1 Torr and 0.01 mL of ammonia (NH3) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) was injected into the chamber. The concentration range of NH3 and HCl was 10\u201350 ppm. The resistance was recorded in real-time at a constant current of 0.01 mA for 30 min. To verify the reversibility and reproducibility of the PPy-coated CNF sensors, the NH3 or HCl vapor was replaced by compressed air after 1 min-exposure to the analyte vapors. The electrical conductivity was measured by a standard four-probe method under ambient conditions .\nThe DRIFT spectra of pristine CNFs and PPy-coated CNFs (22 nm-thickness PPy layer prepared with 0.15 mL Py monomer) are displayed in Fig. 4 . The slanted baselines in the spectra of CNFs and PPy-coated CNFs were ascribed to the plasma reflection phenomenon. The absence of functional groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in the pristine CNFs was obvious from the IR spectrum in Fig. 4(a). A characteristic peak of CNFs associated with C\u2013C\u2013C symmetric stretching was observed at around 850 cm\u22121. On the other hand, the FT-IR spectrum in Fig. 4(b) exhibited five-membered PPy ring-stretching and conjugated C\u2013N stretching vibration bands at 1549 and 1484 cm\u22121, respectively. C\u2013H wagging and in-plane vibration were observed at 783 and 1220 cm\u22121. In addition, the peaks at 2925 and 2851 cm\u22121 were associated with five-membered ring C\u2013H stretching. The stretching and bending motion of N\u2013H in PPy appeared at 3403 and 1633 cm\u22121, respectively. These spectral features mean that the PPy layer was successfully introduced on the CNF surface.\nFig. 5 presents the SEM and TEM images of CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables prepared with 0.15 mL of Py monomer. The images show that the PPy-coated CNFs have uniform and thin PPy layers on the CNF surface. The formation of uniform PPy layers resulted from the characteristics of VDP and the considerably high surface area of CNF, where most of the monomers can adsorb from the vapor phase to the CNF surface. The polymerization of vaporized monomers started exclusively from the surface of CNFs owing to the adsorbed initiators and grew upward. Under these conditions, the overall polymerization was not significantly affected by polymerization in the vapor phase. Although the CNFs have a small surface roughness, the polymer layers are uniform regardless of the thickness. Judging from the FT-IR spectra and TEM images, it was evident that the one-step VDP method was successfully applied to the homogeneous coating of PPy layers onto the CNF surface with high aspect ratios.\nIn general, the thickness of the polymer layer was affected by the feeding amount of the Py monomer, polymerization temperature, and vacuum pressure. The most important factor affecting the thickness of the polymer layer was the monomer/substrate (CNF) (v/w) ratio and vacuum pressure inside the reaction chamber. The monomer/CNF (v/w) ratio can be tuned conveniently by adjusting the feeding amount of monomer, and the vacuum pressure was fixed at 0.1 Torr. Under these experimental conditions, the monomer/CNF (v/w) ratio was intimately proportional to the vapor pressure of feeding monomer. The variation of thickness of the PPy layer as a function of feeding amount of monomer is illustrated in Table 2 . The thickness of the polymer layer tended to increase quickly below 0.15 mL, whereas increased slowly above 0.15 mL. On the other hand, the polymerization of vaporized monomers started exclusively from the surface due to the adsorbed initiators and grew upward. As the polymer layer became thicker, the residual concentration of vaporized monomers decreased and the polymer layer stopped growing at a certain point, which was denoted as a growth limit thickness. Above this point, the polymer layer cannot grow and only physical adsorption\u2013desorption occurs on the surface of the polymer layer.\nIt was expected that the PPy-coated CNFs had an enhanced sensitivity owing to the synergistic combination of advantages of PPy and CNFs compared with pristine CNFs or PPy. The surface area of PPy-coated CNFs is about three times greater than that of pristine PPy, which provides more active sites of PPy for gas adsorption . Moreover, homogeneous and uniform conducting polymer layers can suppress the noises generated from structural defects . The electrical conductivity of PPy-coated CNFs (22-nm thickness PPy layer) was measured to be 30 S/cm, and this was much higher than that of pristine CNFs (5 S/cm). Because the PPy layer on the one-dimensional nanofibers has a longer conjugation length compared with its bulk counterpart, the charge transport in the PPy-coated CNFs was facilitated .\nThe sensing mechanism of CNF/PPy nanocables is associated with the oxidation level of the PPy layer. PPy is generally a p-type semiconductor in conducting state. When appropriate counterions (anions) were introduced into the neutral PPy, the PPy backbone becomes positively charged for charge compensation. Such a doping process gives rise to the formation of charge carrier bands (polaronic/bipolaronic bands) between the interbands (valence/conduction bands) of PPy. First, the presence of polarons in the PPy chains introduces two localized electronic levels in the bandgap: bonding and antibonding cation levels. Furthermore, at higher oxidation levels, the polarons begin to interact with each other with respect to the intrachain pairing of their spins, which in turn generates the doubly charged spinless bipolarons. Importantly, the oxidation level of PPy can be readily affected by various chemical/biological species and electromagnetic waves, which may induce a change in conductance of PPy.\nFig. 6 illustrates the response signal of CNF/PPy nanocables and PPy bulks as a function of analyte concentration. The normalized resistance change is defined as \u0394R/R 0 = (R \u2212 R 0)/R 0, where R is the measured real-time resistance and R 0 is the initial resistance. The normalized resistance change values increased to \u0394R/R 0 = 1\u20133.5 when the concentration of NH3 vapor increased. The detection limit (10 ppm) is comparable to the single-walled CNT/poly(m-aminobenzene sulfonic acid) sensors . On the contrary, the absolute resistance changes dropped significantly to \u0394R/R 0 = 0.3\u20132 after addition of HCl vapor, depending on the concentration of HCl vapor. The response of CNF/PPy nanocables was proportional to the concentration of NH3 and HCl vapors. In addition, it was remarkable that the response of CNF/PPy nanocables was extremely higher than that of the PPy bulk.\nTo further evaluate the sensor performance of the CNF/PPy nanocables, the sensor substrates were exposed to NH3 (20 ppm) and HCl (20 ppm) vapors (Fig. 7 ). When the CNF/PPy nanocables interacted with NH3 vapor, a dedoping reaction rapidly occurred. In other words, the introduction of NH3 molecules into the polymer chains increased the fraction of neutral polymer chains through electron-donating to the oxidized (positively charged) polymer chains, and thus decreased the electrical conductivity due to the decrement in charge carrier density. On the other hand, the PPy chains were oxidized after exposure to HCl vapor because negatively charged chloride ions were incorporated into the PPy layer. In this case, the electrical conductivity of PPy-coated CNFs increased from procuring the polaron/bipolaron states . It was noteworthy that the resistance of PPy-coated CNFs recovered close to the original level when the interaction with vapor was terminated. The response of PPy/CNF nanocables to HCl was smaller than that for NH3, because PPy was in a doped state. Furthermore, the PPy/CNF exhibited a longer recovery time after interaction with NH3 than HCl. These phenomena substantiated that the dedoping reaction associated with exposure to ammonia showed a higher reaction potential and a shorter reaction time than interaction with HCl. This type of test was performed more than 10 times, which demonstrated the reversibility and reproducibility of the PPy-coated CNF sensors.\nOn the other side, the resistance change (response signal) of CNF/PPy is inversely proportional to the contact resistance between CNF and PPy, because a high contact resistance elevates the overall resistance of CNF/PPy nanocables . The enhanced response of CNF/PPy indicated that the contact resistance was relatively small compared with the initial resistance of CNF/PPy nanocables, since the homogeneous PPy layer decreased structural defects. Such a structural advantage also provided increased doping/dedoping sites, leading to enhanced response signals to both NH3 and HCl. These facts confirmed the practicability of the VDP method for uniform coating of polymer layers. Considering the behavior of CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables, it was noteworthy that the response was quick, reversible, reproducible, and highly sensitive.\nFig. 8 illustrates the variation in normalized resistance change of PPy-coated CNFs after interaction with NH3 and HCl as a function of the PPy layer thickness. It was revealed that the resistance change of the PPy-coated CNFs was negligible when the thickness of the PPy layer was smaller than 10 nm (a feeding amount of 0.05 mL). This is because the response of PPy-coated CNFs was dominantly affected by the inherent resistance of CNFs, showing relatively smaller resistance changes by interaction with NH3 or HCl vapor due to the electrical neutrality of CNFs. It was remarkable that the sensitivity of PPy-coated CNFs increased significantly with increasing the PPy thickness and then stopped increasing when the PPy layer thickness was larger than the growth limit thickness point (22 nm for PPy). The adsorption\u2013desorption motions of physically adsorbed molecules caused the signal noises above the growth limit thickness. This plateau pattern was observed in the case of interaction with both NH3 and HCl vapors.\nWe demonstrated that the CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables were prepared by a simple one-step VDP method. This simple process allowed the formation of ultrathin and uniform PPy layers on the CNF surface. The thickness of the polymer layer was dependent on the loaded amount of the monomer. The CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables could be successfully employed as a highly sensitive toxic gas sensor whose response magnitude increased with increasing the NH3 and HCl vapor concentration. The responses of the PPy-coated CNFs after interaction with NH3 and HCl were reversible and reproducible. The responses of PPy-coated CNF sensors to NH3 and HCl vapors were dependent on the thickness of the PPy layer on CNFs. This study is the first experimental demonstration for the realization of an elegant toxic gas sensor based on CNFs.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Among various carbon nanostructures, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have recently attracted a great interest in diverse application areas owing to their unique characteristics such as excellent chemical/mechanical stability and possibility of mass production . Especially, CNFs are promising candidate materials for hydrogen storage devices , electronic components , catalysts and catalytic supports , bioanalytical tools , functional nanocomposites , field emission devices , and substitutes for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) . Such a recent outburst of CNF-based study may originate from their chemical similarity to fullerenes and CNTs. Moreover, CNFs are distinctive high-surface-area materials that can expose exclusively either basal graphite planes or edge planes. Despite of these advantages, a little research has been so far done on the development of CNF-based sensors due to their inherent chemical and environmental stability .\nConducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline, and polythiophene have exhibited beneficial properties attributed to their characteristic \u03c0-electron conjugation system . In particular, the oxidation level of conducting polymers can be easily tuned by the doping/dedoping (oxidation/reduction) mechanism. Thus, conducting polymers are sensitive to specific chemical/biological species, and they are also capable of showing an improved performance as chemical sensors . As a typical example, PPy has been extensively utilized as a sensing element to recognize various analytes. PPy can be easily synthesized and possesses its inherent advantages such as a low band gap, tunable electrical conductivity, environmental stability and electrochromic properties . PPy is capable of presenting noticeable responses to different types of chemical vapors, including acids, bases, alcohols, and alkanes via distinctive response mechanisms .\nWhen CNF is combined with PPy, the CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables may provide an enhanced performance with mechanical durability and improved electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the ultrathin and uniform deposition of a PPy layer (<100 nm) onto the CNF surface can furnish excellent environmental stability, tunable surface property, and enhanced sensitivity. Accordingly, the resulting CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables are expected to exhibit an improved sensor performance compared with single pristine CNF or PPy.\nFrom the viewpoint of uniform and ultrathin polymer coating, vapor deposition polymerization (VDP) provides the polymerization step of vaporized monomers under a vacuum condition and forms the polymer ultrathin layer onto the curved CNF surface. This VDP method may be applicable to surface modification, promotion of adhesion to substrate, and coating of polymeric materials on complicated geometries . Until now, a considerable effort has been devoted toward efficient detection of irritant and toxic gases such as ammonia (NH3), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and NOx for human health and environment protection . Representatively, PPy has been widely exploited as an NH3 sensor . In contrast, detection of HCl has been mainly achieved by polyaniline or its derivatives, because these materials are readily doped with HCl . Meanwhile, CNT/polymer hybrids have been utilized for detection of both NH3 and HCl . However, incorporation of CNF-based materials into a toxic gas sensor has not yet been explored. Accordingly, the motivation of this study is to deposit a uniform and ultrathin PPy layer onto the CNF surface by a one-step VDP method and to investigate the feasibility of CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables as a highly sensitive sensor. This work is a first experimental demonstration for realization of an efficient toxic gas sensor based on the CNF/conducting polymer hybrid. In addition, the chemical response of CNFs encapsulated with PPy was also evaluated with variation in thickness of the PPy layer.\nCNFs with an average diameter of 50 nm were synthesized according to a well-established method, as described in the next section. Fig. 1 exhibits the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the CNFs employed in this work. The detailed preparation conditions and physical properties of the CNF were summarized in Table 1 . Pyrrole (Py) monomer was purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and used without further purification . Iron(III) chloride as a redox initiator was also purchased from Aldrich and employed as received.\nCNFs were prepared from a mixed gas of carbon monoxide, ethylene and hydrogen (CO/C2H2/H2 = 2/2/1, v/v/v) on a non-supported iron catalyst at 600 \u00b0C using a conventional horizontal tube furnace . The iron catalyst powder used was prepared via precipitation of ferric carbonate by adding ammonium bicarbonate, as described by Best and Russell . The precipitate was dried overnight in an oven at 100 \u00b0C and then calcined in air at 400 \u00b0C for 5 h to convert the carbonate into oxide. The calcined oxide was reduced in a 10% H2/He mixture for 20 h at 480 \u00b0C. The reduced catalyst was subsequently cooled to ambient temperature in a helium atmosphere before being passivated in a 5% Air/He mixture for 1 h at room temperature. The passivated catalyst was then removed from the reactor and stored for later use. A quartz flow reactor for the preparation of CNFs was heated in a conventional horizontal tube furnace. The gas flow to the reactor was precisely monitored and regulated with MKS mass flow controllers. The powdered catalyst (30 mg) was placed in a quartz boat at the center of the reactor tube in the furnace. After reduction in a 10% H2/He mixture for 2 h at the prescribed temperature, helium was flushed for 0.5 h. The reactant gas mixture of CO/C2H2/H2 (2/2/1, v/v/v) was then allowed to flow over the catalyst for 1 h. The total amount of carbon deposited for 1 h on stream was determined gravimetrically after the system was cooled to ambient temperature. The prepared carbon was partially oxidized at 450 \u00b0C for 30 min under an air flow (100 mL/min) using the same type of horizontal furnace to remove amorphous carbons on the CNF surface. Hydrogen (99.999%), carbon monoxide (99.9%) and He (99.99%) were obtained from MG industries and used without further purification. Reagent grade iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O), was obtained from Wako Chemical Co.\nThe schematic diagram of the VDP procedure was illustrated in Fig. 2 . A reactor for the VDP by connecting two flasks. The total volume of the reactor was about 100 mL. CNFs (0.1 g) were soaked in an initiator solution (0.1 g FeCl3 in 1 mL water). After thoroughly wetting the CNFs, they were dried and moved into one chamber of the reactor equipped with a sealing apparatus. The reactor was evacuated at room temperature, and the vacuum valve was closed to obtain a static vacuum (0.1 Torr) inside the chamber. Subsequently, liquid pyrrole (Py, 0.05\u20130.3 mL) was introduced into the other chamber of the reactor. The Py was completely vaporized with heating at 70 \u00b0C. The VDP proceeded for 24 h at 70 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of the vaporized monomer. After polymerization, the residual monomer vapor was removed from the reactor by venting. A control experiment was performed with 0.1 g CNF, 0.2 mL Py monomer, and 0.1 g FeCl3 in a 1 mL water solution as an initiator at 70 \u00b0C under 0.1 Torr for 24 h.\nDiffused reflected infrared (DRIFT) spectra were recorded on a Bomem MB 100 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm\u22121 with 128 scans. Images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were taken with JEOL JEM-200CX at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, and the samples diluted in ethanol were cast onto a copper grid. Photographs of SEM were obtained with JEOL 6700. A microarray consisting of a pair of gold interdigitated electrodes with 80 fingers (dimensions: 10 \u03bcm spacing, 4 mm length, 50 nm thickness) was patterned on a glass substrate through photolithography . Fig. 3 illustrates the side view of a sensor substrate consisting of the microelectrodes and CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables. An ethanol solution (0.1 mL) containing 10 wt.% of PPy-coated CNFs was dropped onto the substrate. Then, the PPy-coated CNFs were deposited by spin coating on the substrate for 30 s at 3000 rpm. The substrate was allowed to dry in a vacuum oven to evaporate the residual solvent. The resistance changes of the PPy-coated CNFs were measured at room temperature with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter connected to a computer. The sensor substrate was placed in a 300 mL vacuum chamber with a vapor inlet/outlet maintained at \u223c1 Torr and 0.01 mL of ammonia (NH3) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) was injected into the chamber. The concentration range of NH3 and HCl was 10\u201350 ppm. The resistance was recorded in real-time at a constant current of 0.01 mA for 30 min. To verify the reversibility and reproducibility of the PPy-coated CNF sensors, the NH3 or HCl vapor was replaced by compressed air after 1 min-exposure to the analyte vapors. The electrical conductivity was measured by a standard four-probe method under ambient conditions .\nThe DRIFT spectra of pristine CNFs and PPy-coated CNFs (22 nm-thickness PPy layer prepared with 0.15 mL Py monomer) are displayed in Fig. 4 . The slanted baselines in the spectra of CNFs and PPy-coated CNFs were ascribed to the plasma reflection phenomenon. The absence of functional groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in the pristine CNFs was obvious from the IR spectrum in Fig. 4(a). A characteristic peak of CNFs associated with C\u2013C\u2013C symmetric stretching was observed at around 850 cm\u22121. On the other hand, the FT-IR spectrum in Fig. 4(b) exhibited five-membered PPy ring-stretching and conjugated C\u2013N stretching vibration bands at 1549 and 1484 cm\u22121, respectively. C\u2013H wagging and in-plane vibration were observed at 783 and 1220 cm\u22121. In addition, the peaks at 2925 and 2851 cm\u22121 were associated with five-membered ring C\u2013H stretching. The stretching and bending motion of N\u2013H in PPy appeared at 3403 and 1633 cm\u22121, respectively. These spectral features mean that the PPy layer was successfully introduced on the CNF surface.\nFig. 5 presents the SEM and TEM images of CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables prepared with 0.15 mL of Py monomer. The images show that the PPy-coated CNFs have uniform and thin PPy layers on the CNF surface. The formation of uniform PPy layers resulted from the characteristics of VDP and the considerably high surface area of CNF, where most of the monomers can adsorb from the vapor phase to the CNF surface. The polymerization of vaporized monomers started exclusively from the surface of CNFs owing to the adsorbed initiators and grew upward. Under these conditions, the overall polymerization was not significantly affected by polymerization in the vapor phase. Although the CNFs have a small surface roughness, the polymer layers are uniform regardless of the thickness. Judging from the FT-IR spectra and TEM images, it was evident that the one-step VDP method was successfully applied to the homogeneous coating of PPy layers onto the CNF surface with high aspect ratios.\nIn general, the thickness of the polymer layer was affected by the feeding amount of the Py monomer, polymerization temperature, and vacuum pressure. The most important factor affecting the thickness of the polymer layer was the monomer/substrate (CNF) (v/w) ratio and vacuum pressure inside the reaction chamber. The monomer/CNF (v/w) ratio can be tuned conveniently by adjusting the feeding amount of monomer, and the vacuum pressure was fixed at 0.1 Torr. Under these experimental conditions, the monomer/CNF (v/w) ratio was intimately proportional to the vapor pressure of feeding monomer. The variation of thickness of the PPy layer as a function of feeding amount of monomer is illustrated in Table 2 . The thickness of the polymer layer tended to increase quickly below 0.15 mL, whereas increased slowly above 0.15 mL. On the other hand, the polymerization of vaporized monomers started exclusively from the surface due to the adsorbed initiators and grew upward. As the polymer layer became thicker, the residual concentration of vaporized monomers decreased and the polymer layer stopped growing at a certain point, which was denoted as a growth limit thickness. Above this point, the polymer layer cannot grow and only physical adsorption\u2013desorption occurs on the surface of the polymer layer.\nIt was expected that the PPy-coated CNFs had an enhanced sensitivity owing to the synergistic combination of advantages of PPy and CNFs compared with pristine CNFs or PPy. The surface area of PPy-coated CNFs is about three times greater than that of pristine PPy, which provides more active sites of PPy for gas adsorption . Moreover, homogeneous and uniform conducting polymer layers can suppress the noises generated from structural defects . The electrical conductivity of PPy-coated CNFs (22-nm thickness PPy layer) was measured to be 30 S/cm, and this was much higher than that of pristine CNFs (5 S/cm). Because the PPy layer on the one-dimensional nanofibers has a longer conjugation length compared with its bulk counterpart, the charge transport in the PPy-coated CNFs was facilitated .\nThe sensing mechanism of CNF/PPy nanocables is associated with the oxidation level of the PPy layer. PPy is generally a p-type semiconductor in conducting state. When appropriate counterions (anions) were introduced into the neutral PPy, the PPy backbone becomes positively charged for charge compensation. Such a doping process gives rise to the formation of charge carrier bands (polaronic/bipolaronic bands) between the interbands (valence/conduction bands) of PPy. First, the presence of polarons in the PPy chains introduces two localized electronic levels in the bandgap: bonding and antibonding cation levels. Furthermore, at higher oxidation levels, the polarons begin to interact with each other with respect to the intrachain pairing of their spins, which in turn generates the doubly charged spinless bipolarons. Importantly, the oxidation level of PPy can be readily affected by various chemical/biological species and electromagnetic waves, which may induce a change in conductance of PPy.\nFig. 6 illustrates the response signal of CNF/PPy nanocables and PPy bulks as a function of analyte concentration. The normalized resistance change is defined as \u0394R/R 0 = (R \u2212 R 0)/R 0, where R is the measured real-time resistance and R 0 is the initial resistance. The normalized resistance change values increased to \u0394R/R 0 = 1\u20133.5 when the concentration of NH3 vapor increased. The detection limit (10 ppm) is comparable to the single-walled CNT/poly(m-aminobenzene sulfonic acid) sensors . On the contrary, the absolute resistance changes dropped significantly to \u0394R/R 0 = 0.3\u20132 after addition of HCl vapor, depending on the concentration of HCl vapor. The response of CNF/PPy nanocables was proportional to the concentration of NH3 and HCl vapors. In addition, it was remarkable that the response of CNF/PPy nanocables was extremely higher than that of the PPy bulk.\nTo further evaluate the sensor performance of the CNF/PPy nanocables, the sensor substrates were exposed to NH3 (20 ppm) and HCl (20 ppm) vapors (Fig. 7 ). When the CNF/PPy nanocables interacted with NH3 vapor, a dedoping reaction rapidly occurred. In other words, the introduction of NH3 molecules into the polymer chains increased the fraction of neutral polymer chains through electron-donating to the oxidized (positively charged) polymer chains, and thus decreased the electrical conductivity due to the decrement in charge carrier density. On the other hand, the PPy chains were oxidized after exposure to HCl vapor because negatively charged chloride ions were incorporated into the PPy layer. In this case, the electrical conductivity of PPy-coated CNFs increased from procuring the polaron/bipolaron states . It was noteworthy that the resistance of PPy-coated CNFs recovered close to the original level when the interaction with vapor was terminated. The response of PPy/CNF nanocables to HCl was smaller than that for NH3, because PPy was in a doped state. Furthermore, the PPy/CNF exhibited a longer recovery time after interaction with NH3 than HCl. These phenomena substantiated that the dedoping reaction associated with exposure to ammonia showed a higher reaction potential and a shorter reaction time than interaction with HCl. This type of test was performed more than 10 times, which demonstrated the reversibility and reproducibility of the PPy-coated CNF sensors.\nOn the other side, the resistance change (response signal) of CNF/PPy is inversely proportional to the contact resistance between CNF and PPy, because a high contact resistance elevates the overall resistance of CNF/PPy nanocables . The enhanced response of CNF/PPy indicated that the contact resistance was relatively small compared with the initial resistance of CNF/PPy nanocables, since the homogeneous PPy layer decreased structural defects. Such a structural advantage also provided increased doping/dedoping sites, leading to enhanced response signals to both NH3 and HCl. These facts confirmed the practicability of the VDP method for uniform coating of polymer layers. Considering the behavior of CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables, it was noteworthy that the response was quick, reversible, reproducible, and highly sensitive.\nFig. 8 illustrates the variation in normalized resistance change of PPy-coated CNFs after interaction with NH3 and HCl as a function of the PPy layer thickness. It was revealed that the resistance change of the PPy-coated CNFs was negligible when the thickness of the PPy layer was smaller than 10 nm (a feeding amount of 0.05 mL). This is because the response of PPy-coated CNFs was dominantly affected by the inherent resistance of CNFs, showing relatively smaller resistance changes by interaction with NH3 or HCl vapor due to the electrical neutrality of CNFs. It was remarkable that the sensitivity of PPy-coated CNFs increased significantly with increasing the PPy thickness and then stopped increasing when the PPy layer thickness was larger than the growth limit thickness point (22 nm for PPy). The adsorption\u2013desorption motions of physically adsorbed molecules caused the signal noises above the growth limit thickness. This plateau pattern was observed in the case of interaction with both NH3 and HCl vapors.\nWe demonstrated that the CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables were prepared by a simple one-step VDP method. This simple process allowed the formation of ultrathin and uniform PPy layers on the CNF surface. The thickness of the polymer layer was dependent on the loaded amount of the monomer. The CNF/PPy coaxial nanocables could be successfully employed as a highly sensitive toxic gas sensor whose response magnitude increased with increasing the NH3 and HCl vapor concentration. The responses of the PPy-coated CNFs after interaction with NH3 and HCl were reversible and reproducible. The responses of PPy-coated CNF sensors to NH3 and HCl vapors were dependent on the thickness of the PPy layer on CNFs. This study is the first experimental demonstration for the realization of an elegant toxic gas sensor based on CNFs."

Clinical diagnostics is one of the most promising applications for such microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, especially in a point-of-care setting. Clinical diagnostics refers to the measurement of clinically significant analytes in physiological fluids for either the prevention or treatment of disease. All the benefits of miniaturization such as smaller sample requirement, reduced reagent consumption, decreased analysis time and higher levels of throughput and automation are realized in this application. Smaller patient sample volume minimizes the invasiveness of sample drawing procedures and reduces iatrogenic blood losses particularly in geriatric and pediatric patients (especially neonatal babies), and in certain intensive care situations. Reduced reagent consumption significantly lowers costs, which is an important concern in clinical laboratories today. Analysis times are also effectively shortened due to the high levels of parallelism possible in microfluidic systems. All these benefits make the lab-on-a-chip technology ideal for near-patient and point-of-care testing.\nThe use of microfluidic lab-on-chip technology for clinical applications has been reviewed extensively by T\u00fcd\u00f5s et al. and Verpoorte. Currently almost all microfluidic devices are based on continuous fluid flow in permanent microchannels in glass, plastic or other polymers. Though pumps based on electrokinetic phenomena (electrophoretic separation and electroosmotic pumping) dominate academic research, there is a trend towards the use of alternative fluid actuation mechanisms, since many common samples are not directly compatible with electrokinetic phenomena. For instance, physiological fluids with high ionic strength, such as blood and urine, cannot be pumped using electroosmosis due to excessive Joule heating. Among alternative active pumping mechanisms, centrifuge-based devices, which are independent of physicochemical properties of fluids, have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. Researchers at the University of Cincinnati have also developed a disposable plastic biochip incorporating passive microfluidics with embedded on-chip power sources and an integrated biosensor array to detect glucose, lactate, and O2 in whole blood.\nIn contrast to academic research, most commercial microfluidic devices for clinical diagnostics rely on external pressure sources (syringe pumps) or passive mechanisms (capillary action/gravity) for actuation. Micronics' ORCA Microfluidics platform combines various pressure driven microfluidic elements, such as the diffusion based H-Filter and T-Sensor platforms, in a disposable microchip for point-of-care immunoassays on whole blood. The Biosite Triage Cardiac system measures cardiac markers in whole blood in a microcapillary-based device for point-of-care testing. One of the most popular microfluidic instruments for point-of-care testing is the handheld I-Stat analyser, which measures blood chemistry (glucose, blood gases, electrolytes, urea and more) in whole blood. Almost all the devices mentioned above have their microfluidic module as single-use, disposable, and based on continuous-flow.\nContinuous-flow based microfluidic devices offer very little flexibility in terms of scalability and reconfigurability, and are usually application specific. They also require relatively large volumes of liquid for priming the channels prior to use. An alternative approach towards microfluidics is to manipulate the liquid as unit-sized discrete microdroplets. Due to the architectural similarities with digital microelectronic systems, we have often referred to this approach as \u201cdigital\u201d microfluidics. Digital microfluidic systems have several advantages over continuous-flow systems, the most important being reconfigurability and scalability of architecture.\nElectrowetting and dielectrophoresis are the two most commonly used techniques for microdroplet actuation. Electrowetting is primarily a contact line phenomenon, and refers to electric field-induced interfacial tension changes between a liquid and a solid conductor. On the other hand dielectrophoresis is a bulk phenomena caused as a result of polarization induced in a dielectric liquid by a non-uniform electric field. Dielectrophoresis typically uses high frequency AC voltages (>50 KHz), which can cause significant Joule heating in aqueous samples, even at moderate ionic strengths. In contrast, there is negligible Joule heating in electrowetting, since it can use DC or low frequency AC (<100 Hz) and aqueous droplets of potassium chloride (KCl) with ionic strengths as high as 1 M have been transported without any problems. Electrowetting therefore appears to be applicable for a wider matrix of samples, as compared to dielectrophoresis.\nThe use of electrowetting for dispensing, transport, splitting, merging and mixing of aqueous droplets, has been shown previously. We have also previously demonstrated the transport of enzyme laden droplets without loss in activity, and a complete colorimetric enzyme-kinetic glucose assay (using standard solutions) on an electrowetting chip. In this paper we extend the use of electrowetting device to actuate and analyze human physiological samples. The basic compatibility of the human physiological fluids, such as whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat and tear, with the electrowetting system is first evaluated using reliable and repeatable transportability as the criteria. A glucose assay is then performed on samples of serum, plasma, urine and saliva, and the values are compared with those obtained using a reference method. Finally, a lab-on-a-chip architecture for assaying multiple analytes on a monolithic device is presented, along with preliminary results and future directions for realizing a fully automated lab-on-a-chip platform for clinical diagnostics.\nThe electrowetting system comprises of a photolithographically patterned metal electrode array (chrome or indium tin oxide) on a glass substrate and a continuous ground plane (indium tin oxide on glass) parallel to it. A spacer of known thickness (H) separates the electrode array and the ground plane and the droplets are sandwiched between the two. 1cSt silicone oil (DMS-T01, Gelest, Morrisville, Pennsylvania, USA) is used as the filler medium surrounding the droplets to prevent evaporation and facilitate transport. The electrode array is insulated from the droplet by layer of Parylene C (\u223c800 nm) and both the surfaces are hydrophobized by a thin layer of Teflon AF 1600 (\u223c50 nm). Fig. 1 shows the vertical cross-section of a typical electrowetting setup. The fabrication and operation of the electrowetting system are described in.\nOptical absorbance measurements were done in a plane perpendicular to that of the electrowetting chip. The set-up consisted of a green LED (545 nm, RadioShack) and a photodiode, which is a light-to-voltage converter (TSL257, Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions), as shown in the schematic in Fig. 1. The voltage output of the photodiode V(t) is directly proportional to the light intensity incident on it. The absorbance A(t) is calculated from this measured intensity using the formula A(t) = ln(V0/V(t)), where V0 is the blank reading corresponding to zero absorbance.\nGlucose oxidase (G-6125), peroxidase (P-8125), 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP, A-4382), N-ethyl-N-sulfopropyl-m-toluidine (TOPS, E-8506), and 100 mg dL\u22121 glucose standard (Sigma 16\u201311) were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St Louis, Missouri, USA). The glucose reagent was constituted with glucose oxidase (6 U mL\u22121), peroxidase (6 U mL\u22121), 4-aminoantipyrine (6 mM) and TOPS (6 mM), in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, pH 7.0). The constituted reagent was stable without any visible coloration for 2 days when stored at 4 \u00b0C. Blood samples were obtained from the Duke University Medical Center.\u00a7All experiments reported in this paper were performed at room temperature.\nClinical diagnostics in humans is commonly performed on physiological body fluids such as whole blood, serum, plasma and urine. Other fluids such as saliva, sweat, and tears have also been used in specific contexts. Real physiological samples have always been a major challenge in conventional microfluidic devices, and it is therefore important to establish the compatibility of these fluids with the electrowetting system.\nThe transport of non-biological electrolytes using electrowetting has been demonstrated both in air and in other immiscible media such as silicone oil. On the contrary the transport of fluids containing proteins, such as enzyme-laden reagents and human physiological fluids is not as straightforward. This is because most proteins tend to adsorb irreversibly to hydrophobic surfaces, and contaminate them. In the electrowetting system, the liquid droplet is sandwiched between two hydrophobic (Teflon AF-coated) plates. Any contact between the liquid droplet and this Teflon AF surface, will therefore contaminate the surface. In addition to contamination, protein adsorption can also render the surface permanently hydrophilic. This is detrimental to transport, since electrowetting works on the principle of modifying the wettability of a hydrophobic surface. Therefore any contact between a liquid droplet containing proteins and the Teflon surface should be avoided to prevent contamination and enable transport. As a consequence, air is not a suitable filler medium for assays involving proteins, since the droplet will always be in contact with the Teflon surface. Silicone oil with its low surface tension and spreading property is an ideal alternative. From visual observations and electrical capacitance measurements, during the transport of droplets in silicone oil, we have inferred the presence of a thin film of oil, encapsulating the droplet. This oil film isolates the droplet from the Teflon surfaces, minimizing adsorption and facilitating transport.\nThough the oil film is yet to be extensively characterized, its stability appears to decrease with lowering of the interfacial tension between the liquid (droplet) and oil. Since the liquid\u2013oil interfacial tension typically decreases with increasing protein content, the stability of the oil film is also lower in such cases. A less stable oil film implies more adsorption of proteins on to the Teflon surface and consequently droplets having high protein concentrations are expected to be more difficult to transport and may require higher actuation voltages. The oil film may also be squeezed out by the droplet at high voltages due to electrostatic pressures. Therefore, the actuation voltage has to be carefully chosen to facilitate transport of the droplets while maintaining the oil film.\nDue to the discrete nature of operation of a digital microfluidic system, the maximum switching frequency, which we define as the highest rate at which a droplet can be moved across two adjacent electrodes, is the measure of the transport performance of the system. Higher the switching frequency, more the number of discrete fluidic operations that can be performed per second and higher the throughput of the system. It has been shown previously that the average speed of a droplet at a particular voltage remains constant with physical scaling. The average speed is defined as the product of switching frequency and electrode pitch. Therefore the switching frequency is inversely proportional to the electrode pitch and can be increased by physically scaling the system down.\nThe glucose assay, which is one of the most common and frequently performed assays in clinical diagnostics, was chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of performing biological assays on real samples. A colorimetric enzyme-kinetic method based on Trinder's reaction (eqn. (1)) was used to measure the concentration of glucose.\nConventional colorimetric glucose assay methods use sample dilution factors (sample volume divided by total volume of assay mixture) that are typically greater than 100. However such large dilution factors are not easily realizable on a droplet-based system due to chip real-estate concerns and reduced mixing efficiency. A dilution factor of 2 (1 sample droplet and 1 reagent droplet) is most easily implemented on an electrowetting system and was used in the glucose assay experiments reported in this paper. The method is linear up to a concentration of 100 mg dL\u22121, which was sufficient for the experiments reported in this paper. The values obtained on the electrowetting system were compared to those obtained using a reference method on the same sample. The reference method uses the same assay reaction, but was performed on a bench-top spectrophotometer (Gensys 20) using a more conventional dilution factor of 100 as compared to the dilution factor of 2 on the electrowetting chip.\nThe maximum switching frequency of a droplet of whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat, tear and buffer (0.1 M PBS, pH = 7) was evaluated as a function of the applied voltage. The electrode pitch is L = 1.5 mm and the spacer height is H = 500 \u00b5m with 1cSt silicone oil as the filler fluid. The volumes of the droplets were between 1.3 \u00b5L and 1.5 \u00b5L. Fig. 2 plots the maximum switching frequency of droplets of the various fluids as a function of the actuating voltage. All the fluids could be actuated at frequencies of 20 Hz using less than 65 V. The general trend that can be observed from the graph is that the fluids with less or no protein such as buffer and saliva transport more easily than the ones with higher protein content such as whole blood or serum, which is consistent with what we expected. The transport of a droplet of whole blood was sustainable for \u223c25,000 continuous droplet transfers at 10 Hz (\u223c40 min) using an actuating voltage of 52 V. After 25,000 cycles the droplet was slower to respond and required a higher voltage to maintain the same switching frequency. This performance degradation could either be due to insulator degradation or gradual adsorption of proteins on to the Teflon surface. The transport of other physiological fluids was sustainable for as much or in some cases even more cycles than whole blood, depending on the protein content. An important issue that has not been addressed is the viability of blood cells under electrowetting conditions, and further experiments are required to evaluate this.\nSerum, plasma, urine and saliva were assayed for glucose on the electrowetting device and compared with values obtained using a reference methodology. Saliva and urine samples were spiked with glucose since the original concentrations were too low to be measured in our system. On both the systems 100 mg dL\u22121 glucose was used as the calibrating concentration. Droplets of sample/calibrant (1.5 \u00b5L) and reagent (1.5 \u00b5L) were pipetted manually on to the electrowetting chip (L = 1.5 mm, H = 500 \u00b5m), and merged and physically mixed by shuttling the coalesced droplet across multiple electrodes for 15 s. The time for mixing protocol is higher than what is required and can be reduced to less than 5 s. At the end of the mixing phase, the absorbance is measured for at least 30 s, using the LED-photodiode set up described earlier. The rate of change of absorbance (slope of absorbance versus time graph) is proportional to the glucose concentration in the physiological sample CSAMPLE which is calculated as\nwhere RateSAMPLE, and RateCALIB are the absorbance rates measured for the sample and the calibrant (100 mg dL\u22121) respectively.\nTable 1 compares the results from the on-chip assay with the reference values. The total error in the glucose concentration is 3 mg dL\u22121 for plasma, 8 mg dL\u22121 for serum, 3 mg dL\u22121 for saliva and 16 mg dL\u22121 for urine. The concentrations measured agree well with the reference values, except for urine where there is a significant deviation. This is likely due to interference by uric acid, which reacts with hydrogen peroxide in the Trinder's reaction. The interference may not be significant in the reference method because of the 100 fold dilution, which reduces the concentration of uric acid below interfering levels.\nThe different components of a digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip, such as droplet dispensing, droplet manipulation, physical mixers, biochemical reactors, and detection have already been demonstrated individually or in a partially integrated fashion. In this section we propose a novel lab-on-a-chip architecture which integrates all these components, to demonstrate for the first time a fully integrated and automated electrowetting-based digital microfluidic device.\nFig. 3 shows the high-level schematic of the lab-on-a-chip for analysis of multiple analytes on a digital microfluidic platform. The fluidic components of the lab-on-a-chip include reservoirs, droplet transport pathways or buses, and a waste area. The function of the reservoir is to store a large volume of liquid (samples, reagents, controls and calibrants), from which unit-sized droplets can be generated. A reservoir can also be designated as a waste area, to discard the droplets after use. The droplet pathways consist of contiguous electrodes, which connect different areas of the chip. These electrodes can be used either simply for transport or for other more complex operations such as mixing and splitting. By using a transparent conductor such as indium tin oxide, these electrodes can also be used as optical detection sites.\nA prototype lab-on-a-chip with sample injection elements, reservoirs (and waste), droplet formation structures, fluidic pathways, mixing areas and optical detection sites, was fabricated to test the various components of the architecture both individually and in an integrated fashion. The lab-on-a-chip consisted of 7 reservoirs, a waste area, an outer transport bus, an inner storage bus with optical detection sites, and a mixing area, as shown in Fig. 3. The reservoirs were physically defined by patterning the spacer material and are 2.67 mm in diameter. The electrode pitch is L = 500 \u00b5m and the spacer thickness is H = 90 \u00b5m.\nSample injection is the interface between the microfluidic device and the macroscopic world. The sample (or reagent) is injected into the reservoir through a loading hole in the top plate, designed to fit a small volume (<2 \u00b5L) pipette tip. The loading hole is connected to the reservoir by a narrow channel (shown in Fig. 3) which offers a large resistance to prevent the liquid from spontaneously flowing back into the hole. This resistance is initially overcome by the pipetting action to fill the reservoir with the liquid. We have successfully used this technique to dispense liquids into the reservoirs, though care needs to be taken to avoid the introduction of air bubbles while pipetting.\nDroplet generation is the most critical component of an electrowetting-based lab-on-a-chip. In the proposed architecture, the droplets are formed from an on-chip reservoir in three steps\u20141. A liquid column is extruded from the reservoir by activating a series of electrodes adjacent to it. 2. Once the column overlaps the electrode on which the droplet is to be formed, all the remaining electrodes are deactivated to form a neck in the column. 3. The electrode in the reservoir is then activated to pull the liquid back and break to neck completely to form a droplet.\nFig. 4 shows these steps in the formation of KCl droplets (\u223c20 nL each) from an on-chip reservoir at 50 V. The droplet volume variability was calculated to be less than 2% (standard deviation) from similar dispensing experiments.\nThe fluidic droplet pathways or buses connect various areas of the chip. In order to minimize the number of electrical contacts, the electrowetting chip uses a multiphase bus for the fluidic pathways. In an n-phase bus every nth electrode is electrically connected, and droplets are always spaced apart by (k \u00d7 n \u2212 1) electrodes, where k is any integer. The mixing region still requires independently controllable electrodes. The prototype lab-on-a-chip uses a 4-phase outer transport bus and a 3-phase inner storage bus, as shown in Fig. 3. The use of a multiphase bus (requiring operations to be synchronized) and a single dedicated mixing area imposes constraints on the extent of parallelism achievable using this architecture. An optimized pipelining strategy is therefore needed to achieve maximum throughput.\nTwo pipelined glucose assays are performed on the prototype digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip. Two droplets each of glucose sample (standard solution) and reagent are first formed from 4 different reservoirs. While the first sample and reagent are being mixed the second set of droplets are transported towards the mixing area. The mixed droplet is split into two and one droplet is moved to a storage area for detection, while the other droplet is sent to waste. The second sample and reagent droplets are mixed while detection in the first assay happens.\nFig. 5 shows a snapshot of the chip during the operation of a real pipelined assay. The figure shows colorimetric reactions on two droplets in the 3-phase inner storage bus, sample and reagent mixing, and another sample and reagent droplet being transported on the 4-phase outer bus towards the mixing area, and a droplet being moved to the waste area\u2014all occurring simultaneously. This experiment demonstrates the full capability of the lab-on-a-chip, and this is the first time such high-levels of integration and automation have been realized on any droplet-based system.\nIn this paper we demonstrate for the first time the use of electrowetting to actuate human physiological fluids. Microdroplets of human whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat and tears, were transported at frequencies of 20 Hz using less than 65 V. The transport is also sustainable for at least 25,000 continuous cycles. The use of silicone oil as the filler fluid prevents biofouling, and enables the transport of physiological fluids by forming a thin film between the droplet and the hydrophobic Teflon AF surfaces. A glucose assay was also performed on serum, plasma, urine, and saliva and the values agree well with reference measurements, expect for urine where there is a significant difference due to interference by uric acid. A lab-on-a-chip architecture for pipelined analysis of multiple analytes on a monolithic device is presented, along with preliminary results on sample injection, droplet formation, and multiphase droplet transport. A fully automated and integrated glucose assay is also shown to demonstrate the pipelined operation of the lab-on-chip, as a proof-of-concept. This is the first time such high-levels of integration and automation have been realized on any droplet-based system. Future directions include extending the prototype lab-on-a-chip for real samples. Analytical performance parameters such as specificity, sensitivity, precision, recovery and interferences, also need to be measured to evaluate clinical applicability. Sample preparation needs to be addressed especially if the lab-on-a-chip is to be used in a point-of-care setting.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Microfluidics is the enabling technology behind a whole new class of miniaturized analysis systems for chemical and biological applications. Clinical diagnostics is one of the most promising applications for such microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, especially in a point-of-care setting. Clinical diagnostics refers to the measurement of clinically significant analytes in physiological fluids for either the prevention or treatment of disease. All the benefits of miniaturization such as smaller sample requirement, reduced reagent consumption, decreased analysis time and higher levels of throughput and automation are realized in this application. Smaller patient sample volume minimizes the invasiveness of sample drawing procedures and reduces iatrogenic blood losses particularly in geriatric and pediatric patients (especially neonatal babies), and in certain intensive care situations. Reduced reagent consumption significantly lowers costs, which is an important concern in clinical laboratories today. Analysis times are also effectively shortened due to the high levels of parallelism possible in microfluidic systems. All these benefits make the lab-on-a-chip technology ideal for near-patient and point-of-care testing.\nThe use of microfluidic lab-on-chip technology for clinical applications has been reviewed extensively by T\u00fcd\u00f5s et al. and Verpoorte. Currently almost all microfluidic devices are based on continuous fluid flow in permanent microchannels in glass, plastic or other polymers. Though pumps based on electrokinetic phenomena (electrophoretic separation and electroosmotic pumping) dominate academic research, there is a trend towards the use of alternative fluid actuation mechanisms, since many common samples are not directly compatible with electrokinetic phenomena. For instance, physiological fluids with high ionic strength, such as blood and urine, cannot be pumped using electroosmosis due to excessive Joule heating. Among alternative active pumping mechanisms, centrifuge-based devices, which are independent of physicochemical properties of fluids, have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. Researchers at the University of Cincinnati have also developed a disposable plastic biochip incorporating passive microfluidics with embedded on-chip power sources and an integrated biosensor array to detect glucose, lactate, and O2 in whole blood.\nIn contrast to academic research, most commercial microfluidic devices for clinical diagnostics rely on external pressure sources (syringe pumps) or passive mechanisms (capillary action/gravity) for actuation. Micronics' ORCA Microfluidics platform combines various pressure driven microfluidic elements, such as the diffusion based H-Filter and T-Sensor platforms, in a disposable microchip for point-of-care immunoassays on whole blood. The Biosite Triage Cardiac system measures cardiac markers in whole blood in a microcapillary-based device for point-of-care testing. One of the most popular microfluidic instruments for point-of-care testing is the handheld I-Stat analyser, which measures blood chemistry (glucose, blood gases, electrolytes, urea and more) in whole blood. Almost all the devices mentioned above have their microfluidic module as single-use, disposable, and based on continuous-flow.\nContinuous-flow based microfluidic devices offer very little flexibility in terms of scalability and reconfigurability, and are usually application specific. They also require relatively large volumes of liquid for priming the channels prior to use. An alternative approach towards microfluidics is to manipulate the liquid as unit-sized discrete microdroplets. Due to the architectural similarities with digital microelectronic systems, we have often referred to this approach as \u201cdigital\u201d microfluidics. Digital microfluidic systems have several advantages over continuous-flow systems, the most important being reconfigurability and scalability of architecture.\nElectrowetting and dielectrophoresis are the two most commonly used techniques for microdroplet actuation. Electrowetting is primarily a contact line phenomenon, and refers to electric field-induced interfacial tension changes between a liquid and a solid conductor. On the other hand dielectrophoresis is a bulk phenomena caused as a result of polarization induced in a dielectric liquid by a non-uniform electric field. Dielectrophoresis typically uses high frequency AC voltages (>50 KHz), which can cause significant Joule heating in aqueous samples, even at moderate ionic strengths. In contrast, there is negligible Joule heating in electrowetting, since it can use DC or low frequency AC (<100 Hz) and aqueous droplets of potassium chloride (KCl) with ionic strengths as high as 1 M have been transported without any problems. Electrowetting therefore appears to be applicable for a wider matrix of samples, as compared to dielectrophoresis.\nThe use of electrowetting for dispensing, transport, splitting, merging and mixing of aqueous droplets, has been shown previously. We have also previously demonstrated the transport of enzyme laden droplets without loss in activity, and a complete colorimetric enzyme-kinetic glucose assay (using standard solutions) on an electrowetting chip. In this paper we extend the use of electrowetting device to actuate and analyze human physiological samples. The basic compatibility of the human physiological fluids, such as whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat and tear, with the electrowetting system is first evaluated using reliable and repeatable transportability as the criteria. A glucose assay is then performed on samples of serum, plasma, urine and saliva, and the values are compared with those obtained using a reference method. Finally, a lab-on-a-chip architecture for assaying multiple analytes on a monolithic device is presented, along with preliminary results and future directions for realizing a fully automated lab-on-a-chip platform for clinical diagnostics.\nThe electrowetting system comprises of a photolithographically patterned metal electrode array (chrome or indium tin oxide) on a glass substrate and a continuous ground plane (indium tin oxide on glass) parallel to it. A spacer of known thickness (H) separates the electrode array and the ground plane and the droplets are sandwiched between the two. 1cSt silicone oil (DMS-T01, Gelest, Morrisville, Pennsylvania, USA) is used as the filler medium surrounding the droplets to prevent evaporation and facilitate transport. The electrode array is insulated from the droplet by layer of Parylene C (\u223c800 nm) and both the surfaces are hydrophobized by a thin layer of Teflon AF 1600 (\u223c50 nm). Fig. 1 shows the vertical cross-section of a typical electrowetting setup. The fabrication and operation of the electrowetting system are described in.\nOptical absorbance measurements were done in a plane perpendicular to that of the electrowetting chip. The set-up consisted of a green LED (545 nm, RadioShack) and a photodiode, which is a light-to-voltage converter (TSL257, Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions), as shown in the schematic in Fig. 1. The voltage output of the photodiode V(t) is directly proportional to the light intensity incident on it. The absorbance A(t) is calculated from this measured intensity using the formula A(t) = ln(V0/V(t)), where V0 is the blank reading corresponding to zero absorbance.\nGlucose oxidase (G-6125), peroxidase (P-8125), 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP, A-4382), N-ethyl-N-sulfopropyl-m-toluidine (TOPS, E-8506), and 100 mg dL\u22121 glucose standard (Sigma 16\u201311) were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St Louis, Missouri, USA). The glucose reagent was constituted with glucose oxidase (6 U mL\u22121), peroxidase (6 U mL\u22121), 4-aminoantipyrine (6 mM) and TOPS (6 mM), in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, pH 7.0). The constituted reagent was stable without any visible coloration for 2 days when stored at 4 \u00b0C. Blood samples were obtained from the Duke University Medical Center.\u00a7All experiments reported in this paper were performed at room temperature.\nClinical diagnostics in humans is commonly performed on physiological body fluids such as whole blood, serum, plasma and urine. Other fluids such as saliva, sweat, and tears have also been used in specific contexts. Real physiological samples have always been a major challenge in conventional microfluidic devices, and it is therefore important to establish the compatibility of these fluids with the electrowetting system.\nThe transport of non-biological electrolytes using electrowetting has been demonstrated both in air and in other immiscible media such as silicone oil. On the contrary the transport of fluids containing proteins, such as enzyme-laden reagents and human physiological fluids is not as straightforward. This is because most proteins tend to adsorb irreversibly to hydrophobic surfaces, and contaminate them. In the electrowetting system, the liquid droplet is sandwiched between two hydrophobic (Teflon AF-coated) plates. Any contact between the liquid droplet and this Teflon AF surface, will therefore contaminate the surface. In addition to contamination, protein adsorption can also render the surface permanently hydrophilic. This is detrimental to transport, since electrowetting works on the principle of modifying the wettability of a hydrophobic surface. Therefore any contact between a liquid droplet containing proteins and the Teflon surface should be avoided to prevent contamination and enable transport. As a consequence, air is not a suitable filler medium for assays involving proteins, since the droplet will always be in contact with the Teflon surface. Silicone oil with its low surface tension and spreading property is an ideal alternative. From visual observations and electrical capacitance measurements, during the transport of droplets in silicone oil, we have inferred the presence of a thin film of oil, encapsulating the droplet. This oil film isolates the droplet from the Teflon surfaces, minimizing adsorption and facilitating transport.\nThough the oil film is yet to be extensively characterized, its stability appears to decrease with lowering of the interfacial tension between the liquid (droplet) and oil. Since the liquid\u2013oil interfacial tension typically decreases with increasing protein content, the stability of the oil film is also lower in such cases. A less stable oil film implies more adsorption of proteins on to the Teflon surface and consequently droplets having high protein concentrations are expected to be more difficult to transport and may require higher actuation voltages. The oil film may also be squeezed out by the droplet at high voltages due to electrostatic pressures. Therefore, the actuation voltage has to be carefully chosen to facilitate transport of the droplets while maintaining the oil film.\nDue to the discrete nature of operation of a digital microfluidic system, the maximum switching frequency, which we define as the highest rate at which a droplet can be moved across two adjacent electrodes, is the measure of the transport performance of the system. Higher the switching frequency, more the number of discrete fluidic operations that can be performed per second and higher the throughput of the system. It has been shown previously that the average speed of a droplet at a particular voltage remains constant with physical scaling. The average speed is defined as the product of switching frequency and electrode pitch. Therefore the switching frequency is inversely proportional to the electrode pitch and can be increased by physically scaling the system down.\nThe glucose assay, which is one of the most common and frequently performed assays in clinical diagnostics, was chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of performing biological assays on real samples. A colorimetric enzyme-kinetic method based on Trinder's reaction (eqn. (1)) was used to measure the concentration of glucose.\nConventional colorimetric glucose assay methods use sample dilution factors (sample volume divided by total volume of assay mixture) that are typically greater than 100. However such large dilution factors are not easily realizable on a droplet-based system due to chip real-estate concerns and reduced mixing efficiency. A dilution factor of 2 (1 sample droplet and 1 reagent droplet) is most easily implemented on an electrowetting system and was used in the glucose assay experiments reported in this paper. The method is linear up to a concentration of 100 mg dL\u22121, which was sufficient for the experiments reported in this paper. The values obtained on the electrowetting system were compared to those obtained using a reference method on the same sample. The reference method uses the same assay reaction, but was performed on a bench-top spectrophotometer (Gensys 20) using a more conventional dilution factor of 100 as compared to the dilution factor of 2 on the electrowetting chip.\nThe maximum switching frequency of a droplet of whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat, tear and buffer (0.1 M PBS, pH = 7) was evaluated as a function of the applied voltage. The electrode pitch is L = 1.5 mm and the spacer height is H = 500 \u00b5m with 1cSt silicone oil as the filler fluid. The volumes of the droplets were between 1.3 \u00b5L and 1.5 \u00b5L. Fig. 2 plots the maximum switching frequency of droplets of the various fluids as a function of the actuating voltage. All the fluids could be actuated at frequencies of 20 Hz using less than 65 V. The general trend that can be observed from the graph is that the fluids with less or no protein such as buffer and saliva transport more easily than the ones with higher protein content such as whole blood or serum, which is consistent with what we expected. The transport of a droplet of whole blood was sustainable for \u223c25,000 continuous droplet transfers at 10 Hz (\u223c40 min) using an actuating voltage of 52 V. After 25,000 cycles the droplet was slower to respond and required a higher voltage to maintain the same switching frequency. This performance degradation could either be due to insulator degradation or gradual adsorption of proteins on to the Teflon surface. The transport of other physiological fluids was sustainable for as much or in some cases even more cycles than whole blood, depending on the protein content. An important issue that has not been addressed is the viability of blood cells under electrowetting conditions, and further experiments are required to evaluate this.\nSerum, plasma, urine and saliva were assayed for glucose on the electrowetting device and compared with values obtained using a reference methodology. Saliva and urine samples were spiked with glucose since the original concentrations were too low to be measured in our system. On both the systems 100 mg dL\u22121 glucose was used as the calibrating concentration. Droplets of sample/calibrant (1.5 \u00b5L) and reagent (1.5 \u00b5L) were pipetted manually on to the electrowetting chip (L = 1.5 mm, H = 500 \u00b5m), and merged and physically mixed by shuttling the coalesced droplet across multiple electrodes for 15 s. The time for mixing protocol is higher than what is required and can be reduced to less than 5 s. At the end of the mixing phase, the absorbance is measured for at least 30 s, using the LED-photodiode set up described earlier. The rate of change of absorbance (slope of absorbance versus time graph) is proportional to the glucose concentration in the physiological sample CSAMPLE which is calculated as\nwhere RateSAMPLE, and RateCALIB are the absorbance rates measured for the sample and the calibrant (100 mg dL\u22121) respectively.\nTable 1 compares the results from the on-chip assay with the reference values. The total error in the glucose concentration is 3 mg dL\u22121 for plasma, 8 mg dL\u22121 for serum, 3 mg dL\u22121 for saliva and 16 mg dL\u22121 for urine. The concentrations measured agree well with the reference values, except for urine where there is a significant deviation. This is likely due to interference by uric acid, which reacts with hydrogen peroxide in the Trinder's reaction. The interference may not be significant in the reference method because of the 100 fold dilution, which reduces the concentration of uric acid below interfering levels.\nThe different components of a digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip, such as droplet dispensing, droplet manipulation, physical mixers, biochemical reactors, and detection have already been demonstrated individually or in a partially integrated fashion. In this section we propose a novel lab-on-a-chip architecture which integrates all these components, to demonstrate for the first time a fully integrated and automated electrowetting-based digital microfluidic device.\nFig. 3 shows the high-level schematic of the lab-on-a-chip for analysis of multiple analytes on a digital microfluidic platform. The fluidic components of the lab-on-a-chip include reservoirs, droplet transport pathways or buses, and a waste area. The function of the reservoir is to store a large volume of liquid (samples, reagents, controls and calibrants), from which unit-sized droplets can be generated. A reservoir can also be designated as a waste area, to discard the droplets after use. The droplet pathways consist of contiguous electrodes, which connect different areas of the chip. These electrodes can be used either simply for transport or for other more complex operations such as mixing and splitting. By using a transparent conductor such as indium tin oxide, these electrodes can also be used as optical detection sites.\nA prototype lab-on-a-chip with sample injection elements, reservoirs (and waste), droplet formation structures, fluidic pathways, mixing areas and optical detection sites, was fabricated to test the various components of the architecture both individually and in an integrated fashion. The lab-on-a-chip consisted of 7 reservoirs, a waste area, an outer transport bus, an inner storage bus with optical detection sites, and a mixing area, as shown in Fig. 3. The reservoirs were physically defined by patterning the spacer material and are 2.67 mm in diameter. The electrode pitch is L = 500 \u00b5m and the spacer thickness is H = 90 \u00b5m.\nSample injection is the interface between the microfluidic device and the macroscopic world. The sample (or reagent) is injected into the reservoir through a loading hole in the top plate, designed to fit a small volume (<2 \u00b5L) pipette tip. The loading hole is connected to the reservoir by a narrow channel (shown in Fig. 3) which offers a large resistance to prevent the liquid from spontaneously flowing back into the hole. This resistance is initially overcome by the pipetting action to fill the reservoir with the liquid. We have successfully used this technique to dispense liquids into the reservoirs, though care needs to be taken to avoid the introduction of air bubbles while pipetting.\nDroplet generation is the most critical component of an electrowetting-based lab-on-a-chip. In the proposed architecture, the droplets are formed from an on-chip reservoir in three steps\u20141. A liquid column is extruded from the reservoir by activating a series of electrodes adjacent to it. 2. Once the column overlaps the electrode on which the droplet is to be formed, all the remaining electrodes are deactivated to form a neck in the column. 3. The electrode in the reservoir is then activated to pull the liquid back and break to neck completely to form a droplet.\nFig. 4 shows these steps in the formation of KCl droplets (\u223c20 nL each) from an on-chip reservoir at 50 V. The droplet volume variability was calculated to be less than 2% (standard deviation) from similar dispensing experiments.\nThe fluidic droplet pathways or buses connect various areas of the chip. In order to minimize the number of electrical contacts, the electrowetting chip uses a multiphase bus for the fluidic pathways. In an n-phase bus every nth electrode is electrically connected, and droplets are always spaced apart by (k \u00d7 n \u2212 1) electrodes, where k is any integer. The mixing region still requires independently controllable electrodes. The prototype lab-on-a-chip uses a 4-phase outer transport bus and a 3-phase inner storage bus, as shown in Fig. 3. The use of a multiphase bus (requiring operations to be synchronized) and a single dedicated mixing area imposes constraints on the extent of parallelism achievable using this architecture. An optimized pipelining strategy is therefore needed to achieve maximum throughput.\nTwo pipelined glucose assays are performed on the prototype digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip. Two droplets each of glucose sample (standard solution) and reagent are first formed from 4 different reservoirs. While the first sample and reagent are being mixed the second set of droplets are transported towards the mixing area. The mixed droplet is split into two and one droplet is moved to a storage area for detection, while the other droplet is sent to waste. The second sample and reagent droplets are mixed while detection in the first assay happens.\nFig. 5 shows a snapshot of the chip during the operation of a real pipelined assay. The figure shows colorimetric reactions on two droplets in the 3-phase inner storage bus, sample and reagent mixing, and another sample and reagent droplet being transported on the 4-phase outer bus towards the mixing area, and a droplet being moved to the waste area\u2014all occurring simultaneously. This experiment demonstrates the full capability of the lab-on-a-chip, and this is the first time such high-levels of integration and automation have been realized on any droplet-based system.\nIn this paper we demonstrate for the first time the use of electrowetting to actuate human physiological fluids. Microdroplets of human whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat and tears, were transported at frequencies of 20 Hz using less than 65 V. The transport is also sustainable for at least 25,000 continuous cycles. The use of silicone oil as the filler fluid prevents biofouling, and enables the transport of physiological fluids by forming a thin film between the droplet and the hydrophobic Teflon AF surfaces. A glucose assay was also performed on serum, plasma, urine, and saliva and the values agree well with reference measurements, expect for urine where there is a significant difference due to interference by uric acid. A lab-on-a-chip architecture for pipelined analysis of multiple analytes on a monolithic device is presented, along with preliminary results on sample injection, droplet formation, and multiphase droplet transport. A fully automated and integrated glucose assay is also shown to demonstrate the pipelined operation of the lab-on-chip, as a proof-of-concept. This is the first time such high-levels of integration and automation have been realized on any droplet-based system. Future directions include extending the prototype lab-on-a-chip for real samples. Analytical performance parameters such as specificity, sensitivity, precision, recovery and interferences, also need to be measured to evaluate clinical applicability. Sample preparation needs to be addressed especially if the lab-on-a-chip is to be used in a point-of-care setting."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe precious metals occur in geological materials at trace and ultratrace levels and their direct determination is beyond the scope of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Hence large number of research papers are being published worldwide on separation and pre-concentration techniques using solvent extraction , ion exchange , co-precipitation , cyanidation sorption, including a review article published recently . Amongst sorbents, AC is being widely used as multielement trace collector , mostly in presence of suitable complexing agents. The authors in their previous published work, preconcentrated on AC, rare earth elements (REE) in absence of complexing agent and selected transition elements in presence of complexing agent, pyridyl azo resorcinol (PAR) . Amongst precious metals, AC is widely used for preconcentration of gold from natural water and geological materials . The gold is quantitatively sorbed on to AC, in presence of P-dimethyl aminobenzene-rhodanine and the Ag is quantitatively sorbed on to AC in presence of complexing agents like, dithiozone and ammonium salt of dithiophosphoric acid, 0,0-diethylester . Both Au and Ag sorbed on to AC as dithiozonate complexes . The Pd was preconcentrated on to AC in presence of cyclohexane 1,2-dione dioxime . The Pd and Pt in sea water and Au, Pd and Pt in ashed vegetation were determined based on preconcentration on to AC. The determination of Au, Ag and Pd in single AC ashed solution is ruled out as Ag and Pd get adsorbed to silica crucible during ignition and are not recoverable quantitatively unlike Au. The preconcentration of Au, Ag and Pd together on to AC from single sample solution (of geological samples) and their quantitative recovery by wet ashing is largely unknown. Hence, flame AAS method is developed based on pre-concentration of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC and their recovery by wet digestion. The details are presented in this paper.\nActivated carbon (Proanalysi, Dermstadt, Germany) was purified by treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and HCl. The quartz double distilled water, HNO3 and HCl were used throughout the work.\nAll standard stock solutions of Au, Ag and Pd (1 mg ml\u22121), were prepared from specpure (Johnson Matthey) chemicals following procedures as given below.\nA 1.0 g of gold chloride, AuCl3, containing 25% of Au (taken in 250-ml beaker) was dissolved in minimum volume (10 ml) of aqua regia and evaporated on water bath to near dryness. The residue was then treated with 5 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl twice and evaporated each time to near dryness, dissolved in 50 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl and made to 250 ml in volumetric flask with distilled water. The solution was standardised gravimetrically by reduction with hydroquinone .\nA 0.2672 g of Ammonium chloro palladite, (NH4)2Pd2Cl6, was dissolved in 20 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl and heated on waterbath. The cooled solution was made to 100 ml volume with water and standardised titrimetrically .\nA 0.158 g of silver nitrate, AgNO3, (dried at 110\u00b0C) was dissolved in about 20 ml quartz distilled water and made up to 100 ml with 10% (v/v) HNO3 and stored in plastic bottle away from light.\nJust before use the working standards of Au, Ag and Pd of concentration 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 \u03bcg ml\u22121 were prepared separately from intermediate stock standard (10 \u03bcg ml\u22121) by appropriate dilution and by maintaining 10% (v/v) HCl concentration except for Ag, which was maintained in 10% (v/v) HNO3. The calibration graph was obtained by aspirating pure calibration working standards directly and it follows Beer's law.\nFlame AAS from GBC Scientific Equipment Pvt Ltd., Australia, model AVANTA-P was used for measuring Au, Ag and Pd in air \u2014 acetylene flame. The operating conditions are given in Table 1 . In addition NA, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd and Cu were also determined by flame AAS . The ICP-AES equipment (8410, GBC, Australia) was used for the measurement of Pt, Ru, Rh , REE, Y, Sc and V . The concentration of uranium was measured by Fluorimetry .\nA 10 g amount of finely powdered sample (\u2212200 mesh) was taken in porcelain dish (100 ml volume), roasted at 650\u00b0C for 30 min, transferred into 400 ml beaker and heated on sandbath twice with aqua regia (50 and 30 ml) evaporating each time to moist residue. The residue was then digested with 10 ml of concentrated HCl twice and evaporated each time to moist residue, followed by the digestion of sample with 5 ml of conc. HCl for 2 min (for effective extraction of analytes) on waterbath. The sample solution was further diluted to about 100 ml with water and digested for 30 min. The solution was filtered (Whatman No. 540) into 250 ml beaker, washed thoroughly with hot water, cooled and adjusted the pH to \u223c1 with ammonia solution (The total volume obtained shall be maximum of 200 ml). The filtrate was treated with 0.5 g of powdered activated carbon (AC), stirred occasionally (stirring for 2 min for every 30 min) for 4 h and filtered (Whatman 540, cut to circles of dia 50 mm) using vacuum filtration unit. The AC pellet along with filter paper transferred back into the same beaker (250-ml). The traces of AC adhering to glass container washed back into the same beaker with 50% (v/v) HNO3. The whole solution was boiled initially with 20 ml of conc. HNO3 for about 5 min (to oxidise easily oxidizable organic matter) and then with 5 ml of HClO4 to completely oxidise and solubulize the carbon containing the analytes. Added 1 ml of HCl to the clear solution thus obtained, made to 10 ml in volumetric flask and aspirated into flame AAS for determination of Au, Ag and Pd. The blank was carried through the entire procedure and made to 10 ml.\nThe effects of several experimental parameters on the sorption of Au, Ag and Pd were studied at two different concentrations, i.e by spiking 200 ml of distilled water with 10 and 20 \u03bcg each of analyte under study and using the procedure described in Section 2.4. These parameters comprise, HCl concentration, weight of AC, contact time, sample volume, HNO3 concentration (for desorption of Ag and Pd) and HNO3\u2013HClO4 concentration (for desorption of Au, Ag and Pd).\nThe effect of 0.1 N mineral acids (HCl, HNO3 and H2SO4) on the sorption of analytes on to AC was studied following the procedure as given in Section 2.4. It was found experimentally that in 0.1 N HNO3 medium, sorption of Ag and Pd was 45 and 75%, whereas in 0.1 N H2SO4 medium, it was 40 and 70%, respectively, and in all 0.1 N acids, Au was quantitatively sorbed (better than 92%). Since the sorption of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC in \u223c0.1 N HCl medium was quantitative when compared with \u223c0.1 N HNO3 and \u223c0.1 N H2SO4 medium, its effct was studied in the range from 0.05 to 2.0 N. In addition to Au, Ag and Pd, the behaviour of other three precious metals (Ru, Rh and Pt) towards the sorption on to AC in HCl medium was also studied for the sake of completeness and to see the possibility of extending the present method for determination of these elements along with Au, Ag and Pd. The results are given in Table 2 . The sorption of Au, Ag and Pd onto AC was quantitative (>92%) in the acid concentration range from 0.05 to 0.5 N. Whereas the sorption of Pt (around 20%), Ru (<1%) and Rh (<1%) was very poor may be, as they have very weak affinity towards AC and hence the quantitative determination of these elements along with Au, Ag and Pd is ruled out by the present method.\nThe quantity of AC was varied from 50 to 500 mg by maintaining other optimal conditions as given in the procedure (Section 2.4). The results are given in Table 3 . The optimum quantity of AC was fixed at 500 mg, although 300 mg of AC was found to be adequate, keeping in view high concentrations of competing ions arising out of complex matrix solution prepared from 10 g of sample.\nThe contact time of analytes with AC was varied from 10 min to 4 h by maintaining other parameters as given in procedure. The results are given in Table 4 . Although quantitative sorption of elements under study was evident from 2 h onwards, 4 h was chosen as optimum in order to allow sufficient contact time for quantitative sorption of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC from sample solution volume arising out of 10 g sample and more. It is worthwile to note that Au got quantitatively sorbed onto AC within 10 min whereas Ag and Pd took almost 4 h. Since gold has very strong affinity for organic carbon, it is held strongly (within 10 min) whereas Ag and Pd have poor affinity for carbon, it is held loosely (within 4 h). It is reported in the literature, the existence of electrostatic linking between Au and AC.\nSince Au, Ag and pd are present in geological samples at trace levels, it is essential to start with atleast 10 g sample in order to analyse these elements down to 0.1 ppm. Decomposition of 10-g sample by aquaregia is likely to result in higher sample solution volume after filtration due to thorough washing. Hence volume effect was studied from 100 to 500 ml, by keeping other experimental conditions as given in procedure. It was found experimentally that at all sample volumes studied, sorption of Au, Ag and Pd was quantitative (>92%).\nThe effect of sample weight was studied in the range of 0.5\u201320 g by maintaining other parameters as given in procedure. Experimentally, quantitative sorption of analytes was observed, at all sample weights. Hence sample weight of the order of 10\u201320 g could easily be taken up for the analysis.\nThe precious metals sorbed on to AC were normally determined either directly by NAA, ETA, EDXRF or by igniting charcoal to ashes . Me et al. attempted wet ashing using several reagents to recover Au from AC, but in vain. Gold desorption from AC was attempted using sulfide and dilute NaOH/organic solvent mixtures like water\u2013acetone\u2013NaOH mix and iso propyl alcohol\u2013H2O\u2013thiourea\u2013hydroxide mix . However, in all the cases, the recoveries are not quantitative. The authors made efforts to recover Au, Ag and Pd from AC by wet ashing using several oxidising agents like nitric acid, aquaregia, bromine aquaregia, KBrO3/HBr, KMnO4 and K2Cr2O7. The thiourea at varying concentrations was also tried. But none of the reagents able to desorb Au quantitatively from AC, though Ag and Pd were recovered quantitatively using conc. HNO3. The effect of varying concentration of HNO3 and the effect of conc. HNO3 and conc. HClO4 was studied on desorption of analytes from AC. The procedure used for sorption of analytes and optimal conditions maintained were essentially the same, as given in Section 2.4. The percent recoveries for Au, Ag and Pd from AC are given in Table 5 . Only Ag and Pd were recovered quantitatively from carbon using conc. HNO3, whereas Au recovered to the extent of 40%. In an effort to completely oxidise AC to recover gold, AC was first boiled with conc. HNO3 to oxidise the easily oxidizable organic matter and later treated with conc. perchloric acid (5 ml), to oxidise and solubilise AC completely. The method of HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment of carbon, yielded quantitative recoveries for Au, Ag and Pd, which was hitherto not possible by various oxidising agents even under drastic conditions. In the present method there was no need to subject calibration standards, through the entire procedure along with samples, as the sorption of analytes were quantitative when compared with other non quantitative methods reported .\nBased on the experimental studies described above, the optimal conditions required for quantitative sorption of Au, Ag and Pd are as given below.\nSample weight \u2014 10 g (variable); sample solution volume \u2014 200 ml (variable); optimum pH \u2014 \u223c1; weight of AC \u2014 0.5 g; contact time \u2014 4 h; desorption of Ag and Pd \u2014 by conc. HNO3 (20 ml) boiling (5 min); desorption of Au, Ag and Pd \u2014 by conc. HNO3 (20 ml) boiling (5 min), followed by boiling with HClO4 (5 ml) till AC was solubalised.\nThus by simply manipulating acidity, amount of AC and duration of contact time, quantitative sorption of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC was achieved. The use of complexing agents like rhodanine , dithiozone , dithiophosphoric acid-0,0-diethyl ester or cyclohexane 1,2-dione dioxime was not necessary to achieve >90% sorption on to AC. Thus the use of reagents is avoided. The use of powdered AC in beaker instead of column provides more surface area and prolonged contact time, which facilitates quantitative sorption in HCl medium at pH 1. The sample solution volume is not a limiting factor, with the result large sample volume arising out of 10 g or more of sample could be processed to have lower determination limits.\nIn dry ashing, the AC is ignited to ashes and the ash is treated with acid to recover gold. This method of recovery of gold is tedious and time consuming, requiring atleast of about 3 h. The major disadvantage of dry ashing during ignition is, the Ag and Pd get adsorbed to container (silica crucible) to various degree, depending on the ignition temperature and time duration. At 6000\u00b0C both Ag and Pd get sorbed to silica crucible to the extent of 38 and 15%, respectively, and at 800\u00b0C it was found to be 75 and 30% and under similar conditions gold does not get sorbed on to crucible. The extent of sorption given above was confirmed by dissolving, inside surface coating of silica crucible with HF\u2013HNO3 and analysing the resultant solution for Ag and Pd. The consistent quantitative recovery of adsorbed Ag and Pd from crucible was not possible even by aqua regia treatment under drastic conditions except for gold. Hence the determination of Ag, Pd along with Au in single ashed solution is ruled out. This could be, one of the reason, why methods are largely unknown for determination of Au, Ag and Pd in the same sample solution by flame AAS through dry ash route. Hence the method of wet ashing was adopted using HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment. In this method, carbon was completely oxidised and solubilised using HNO3\u2013HClO4 leaving clear solution, for the analysis of Au, Ag and Pd. In addition, the method is expeditious and not tedious when compared with dry ashing. The method is field oriented as small preconcentrated volume could be sent to main laboratory from field lab, for flame AAS measurements.\nThere are various ways by which metals can be sorbed on to AC from aqueous medium, (a) by complexing with chelating agent , (b) by reduction in valency state and (c) by an ion exchange process at the carbon surface . In case of Au, Ag and Pd, it could be the combination of both (b) and (c), as no complexing agent is used in the present method. It is reported that some of the noble metals get reduced to elemental state at the AC surface. The sorption of Ag on to AC in 0.1N HCl medium is quantitative and less than 50% in 0.1N HNO3 and H2SO4 medium. This suggests that AgCl may be preferred by AC, whereas nitrates and sulphates partially prevent sorption. Formation and sorption of AgCl molecules is predicted by Beinrohr et al. . Further with increase in acidity of HCl, sorption of Ag on to AC drops (Table 2) and this is probably due to formation of AgCl2 \u2212 type of species, which is not favoured by AC. Formation of this type of species is reported, at high HCl concentration . In our experiments, we found almost similar behaviour of Ag and Pd with respect to (i) contact time, both Ag and Pd quantitatively sorbed on AC in about 4 h, (ii) desorption, both recovered from AC with conc. HNO3 boiling and (iii) ignition, both gets sorbed to silica crucible when charcoal ignited to ashes. Hence chloro species of Pd, may be responsible for sorption in HCl medium. The desorption of Ag and Pd with conc. HNO3 indicated that Ag and Pd are not held very strongly on to AC like Au. This could be related to, as stated earlier, long contact time for sorption of Ag/Pd (due to poor affinity towards AC) and very short contact time for Au (strong affinity towards AC). It was found experimentally that various oxidising agents and combination of acids fail to oxidise AC completely and hence Au was not recovered completely. With combination of HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment, the AC was completely oxidised and solubilised fully during Perchloric acid fuming, resulting in total recovery of Au, along with Ag and Pd. The high boiling point of HClO4 and its powerful oxidising properties, facilitates complete oxidation of AC leaving clear solution. As stated earlier, the sorption of Pt, Ru and Rh on AC is very poor due to very weak affinity towards AC.\nKeeping in view application to various geological samples in particular to gold and silver bearing minerals, sorption of various major, minor and trace elements and their interferences was studied at the pH of interest. The 200 ml of quartz double distilled water was spiked with the following amounts, 10 mg each of Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, Na, K; 200 \u03bcg each of Mn, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, V, Y, Ce, REE, U; 25 \u03bcg each of Au, Ag, and Pd. The procedure as described in Section 2.4 was followed. The sorbed elements from AC were desorbed by boiling with HNO3\u2013HClO4, made upto 25 ml in volumetric flask and aspirated into flame AAS and ICP-AES, for the determination of trace elements (as mentioned in experimental section). From the recovery values the percent sorption values are calculated back and indicated in Table 6 . The quantitative recoveries were obtained for Au, Ag and Pd in presence of various diverse ions. The Cd, Cu and U were recovered from AC in the range of 3\u20138%, and do not interfere in flame AAS determination of Au, Ag and Pd.\nThe accuracy of the method was evaluated by using international standard reference materials i.e. Canada centre for mineral and energy technology (CANMET) standards, MA-3, MA-1b (gold ores) were used to evaluate gold and FER-1 (iron formation sample), SU-1A (Ni\u2013Cu\u2013Co ore), CPB-1 (lead concentrate) were used for silver. In addition ASK-3 (sulphide ore) was used to evaluate Ag and one inhouse standard, kolar gold field (KGF, India) was used for Au. The results compare well with recommended/consensus values as seen from Table 7 . The precision of the method was evaluated by taking samples in quadruplicate and making replicate measurements. The R.S.D. of the method varies between 2 and 10%. The KGF sample (22-ppm Au) was analysed with an error of \u00b15%. The relative error obtained by present method was within \u00b110% for most of the samples. As no standard reference sample for palladium is available in our laboratory, its accuracy was evaluated by spiking four sample solutions with 10 \u03bcg of Pd. The recoveries were found to be better than 90% with an R.S.D. of \u00b110%. The sorption of most of the major elements present in geological samples at the pH of interest are minimal and does not interfere by flame AAS.\nThe detection limits (3\u00d7S.D.) were calculated using procedural blank consisting of 200 ml water (adjusted to pH \u223c1), 0.5-g AC taken through entire procedure as in Section 2.4. The detection limits (n=4) are given in Table 1. In order to overcome sample inhomogenity (nugget effect) and to determine Au, Ag and Pd down to 0.1 ppm, it is essential to start with 10 g sample. When 10-g sample containing (0.1 \u03bcg g\u22121 of Au, Ag and Pd) was taken through entire procedure and made to final volume of 10 ml, then it contains 0.1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of each analyte. This works out to be 0.1 ppm.\nThe method is simple and economical as only AC is used for preconcentration of Au, Ag and Pd, where as the reported methods make use of specific complexing reagent. The AC is the most inexpensive sorbent used in the present method. Most of the reported methods using AC for sorption of Au use the route of dry ashing to determine Au by flame AAS. This method of igniting carbon to ashes in silica crucible is not only tedious and time consuming but also results in loss of Ag and Pd due to sorption. Thus Ag and Pd cannot be determined along with Au by dry ashing. The advantages associate with the recommended wet ashing procedure (HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment) are, (1) Au, Ag and Pd can be determined quantitatively by flame AAS in a single sample solution; (2) The ignition of AC to ashes is avoided, thus making the method relatively rapid. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by analysing standard reference materials (CANMET Standards). The percent R.S.D. of the method is \u00b110% at 0.1-ppm level based on 10-g sample. The method was applied on large number of geological samples for determination of Au, Ag and Pd. For samples where only Ag and Pd need to be determined, simple nitric acid boiling of AC, could yield quantitative recoveries. This method could be easily adopted by any laboratory as the inputs (only AC) and the operation skills required are minimal compared with methods based on co-precipitation, solvent extraction and ion exchange.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "The precious metals occur in geological materials at trace and ultratrace levels and their direct determination is beyond the scope of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Hence large number of research papers are being published worldwide on separation and pre-concentration techniques using solvent extraction , ion exchange , co-precipitation , cyanidation sorption, including a review article published recently . Amongst sorbents, AC is being widely used as multielement trace collector , mostly in presence of suitable complexing agents. The authors in their previous published work, preconcentrated on AC, rare earth elements (REE) in absence of complexing agent and selected transition elements in presence of complexing agent, pyridyl azo resorcinol (PAR) . Amongst precious metals, AC is widely used for preconcentration of gold from natural water and geological materials . The gold is quantitatively sorbed on to AC, in presence of P-dimethyl aminobenzene-rhodanine and the Ag is quantitatively sorbed on to AC in presence of complexing agents like, dithiozone and ammonium salt of dithiophosphoric acid, 0,0-diethylester . Both Au and Ag sorbed on to AC as dithiozonate complexes . The Pd was preconcentrated on to AC in presence of cyclohexane 1,2-dione dioxime . The Pd and Pt in sea water and Au, Pd and Pt in ashed vegetation were determined based on preconcentration on to AC. The determination of Au, Ag and Pd in single AC ashed solution is ruled out as Ag and Pd get adsorbed to silica crucible during ignition and are not recoverable quantitatively unlike Au. The preconcentration of Au, Ag and Pd together on to AC from single sample solution (of geological samples) and their quantitative recovery by wet ashing is largely unknown. Hence, flame AAS method is developed based on pre-concentration of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC and their recovery by wet digestion. The details are presented in this paper.\nActivated carbon (Proanalysi, Dermstadt, Germany) was purified by treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and HCl. The quartz double distilled water, HNO3 and HCl were used throughout the work.\nAll standard stock solutions of Au, Ag and Pd (1 mg ml\u22121), were prepared from specpure (Johnson Matthey) chemicals following procedures as given below.\nA 1.0 g of gold chloride, AuCl3, containing 25% of Au (taken in 250-ml beaker) was dissolved in minimum volume (10 ml) of aqua regia and evaporated on water bath to near dryness. The residue was then treated with 5 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl twice and evaporated each time to near dryness, dissolved in 50 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl and made to 250 ml in volumetric flask with distilled water. The solution was standardised gravimetrically by reduction with hydroquinone .\nA 0.2672 g of Ammonium chloro palladite, (NH4)2Pd2Cl6, was dissolved in 20 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl and heated on waterbath. The cooled solution was made to 100 ml volume with water and standardised titrimetrically .\nA 0.158 g of silver nitrate, AgNO3, (dried at 110\u00b0C) was dissolved in about 20 ml quartz distilled water and made up to 100 ml with 10% (v/v) HNO3 and stored in plastic bottle away from light.\nJust before use the working standards of Au, Ag and Pd of concentration 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 \u03bcg ml\u22121 were prepared separately from intermediate stock standard (10 \u03bcg ml\u22121) by appropriate dilution and by maintaining 10% (v/v) HCl concentration except for Ag, which was maintained in 10% (v/v) HNO3. The calibration graph was obtained by aspirating pure calibration working standards directly and it follows Beer's law.\nFlame AAS from GBC Scientific Equipment Pvt Ltd., Australia, model AVANTA-P was used for measuring Au, Ag and Pd in air \u2014 acetylene flame. The operating conditions are given in Table 1 . In addition NA, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd and Cu were also determined by flame AAS . The ICP-AES equipment (8410, GBC, Australia) was used for the measurement of Pt, Ru, Rh , REE, Y, Sc and V . The concentration of uranium was measured by Fluorimetry .\nA 10 g amount of finely powdered sample (\u2212200 mesh) was taken in porcelain dish (100 ml volume), roasted at 650\u00b0C for 30 min, transferred into 400 ml beaker and heated on sandbath twice with aqua regia (50 and 30 ml) evaporating each time to moist residue. The residue was then digested with 10 ml of concentrated HCl twice and evaporated each time to moist residue, followed by the digestion of sample with 5 ml of conc. HCl for 2 min (for effective extraction of analytes) on waterbath. The sample solution was further diluted to about 100 ml with water and digested for 30 min. The solution was filtered (Whatman No. 540) into 250 ml beaker, washed thoroughly with hot water, cooled and adjusted the pH to \u223c1 with ammonia solution (The total volume obtained shall be maximum of 200 ml). The filtrate was treated with 0.5 g of powdered activated carbon (AC), stirred occasionally (stirring for 2 min for every 30 min) for 4 h and filtered (Whatman 540, cut to circles of dia 50 mm) using vacuum filtration unit. The AC pellet along with filter paper transferred back into the same beaker (250-ml). The traces of AC adhering to glass container washed back into the same beaker with 50% (v/v) HNO3. The whole solution was boiled initially with 20 ml of conc. HNO3 for about 5 min (to oxidise easily oxidizable organic matter) and then with 5 ml of HClO4 to completely oxidise and solubulize the carbon containing the analytes. Added 1 ml of HCl to the clear solution thus obtained, made to 10 ml in volumetric flask and aspirated into flame AAS for determination of Au, Ag and Pd. The blank was carried through the entire procedure and made to 10 ml.\nThe effects of several experimental parameters on the sorption of Au, Ag and Pd were studied at two different concentrations, i.e by spiking 200 ml of distilled water with 10 and 20 \u03bcg each of analyte under study and using the procedure described in Section 2.4. These parameters comprise, HCl concentration, weight of AC, contact time, sample volume, HNO3 concentration (for desorption of Ag and Pd) and HNO3\u2013HClO4 concentration (for desorption of Au, Ag and Pd).\nThe effect of 0.1 N mineral acids (HCl, HNO3 and H2SO4) on the sorption of analytes on to AC was studied following the procedure as given in Section 2.4. It was found experimentally that in 0.1 N HNO3 medium, sorption of Ag and Pd was 45 and 75%, whereas in 0.1 N H2SO4 medium, it was 40 and 70%, respectively, and in all 0.1 N acids, Au was quantitatively sorbed (better than 92%). Since the sorption of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC in \u223c0.1 N HCl medium was quantitative when compared with \u223c0.1 N HNO3 and \u223c0.1 N H2SO4 medium, its effct was studied in the range from 0.05 to 2.0 N. In addition to Au, Ag and Pd, the behaviour of other three precious metals (Ru, Rh and Pt) towards the sorption on to AC in HCl medium was also studied for the sake of completeness and to see the possibility of extending the present method for determination of these elements along with Au, Ag and Pd. The results are given in Table 2 . The sorption of Au, Ag and Pd onto AC was quantitative (>92%) in the acid concentration range from 0.05 to 0.5 N. Whereas the sorption of Pt (around 20%), Ru (<1%) and Rh (<1%) was very poor may be, as they have very weak affinity towards AC and hence the quantitative determination of these elements along with Au, Ag and Pd is ruled out by the present method.\nThe quantity of AC was varied from 50 to 500 mg by maintaining other optimal conditions as given in the procedure (Section 2.4). The results are given in Table 3 . The optimum quantity of AC was fixed at 500 mg, although 300 mg of AC was found to be adequate, keeping in view high concentrations of competing ions arising out of complex matrix solution prepared from 10 g of sample.\nThe contact time of analytes with AC was varied from 10 min to 4 h by maintaining other parameters as given in procedure. The results are given in Table 4 . Although quantitative sorption of elements under study was evident from 2 h onwards, 4 h was chosen as optimum in order to allow sufficient contact time for quantitative sorption of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC from sample solution volume arising out of 10 g sample and more. It is worthwile to note that Au got quantitatively sorbed onto AC within 10 min whereas Ag and Pd took almost 4 h. Since gold has very strong affinity for organic carbon, it is held strongly (within 10 min) whereas Ag and Pd have poor affinity for carbon, it is held loosely (within 4 h). It is reported in the literature, the existence of electrostatic linking between Au and AC.\nSince Au, Ag and pd are present in geological samples at trace levels, it is essential to start with atleast 10 g sample in order to analyse these elements down to 0.1 ppm. Decomposition of 10-g sample by aquaregia is likely to result in higher sample solution volume after filtration due to thorough washing. Hence volume effect was studied from 100 to 500 ml, by keeping other experimental conditions as given in procedure. It was found experimentally that at all sample volumes studied, sorption of Au, Ag and Pd was quantitative (>92%).\nThe effect of sample weight was studied in the range of 0.5\u201320 g by maintaining other parameters as given in procedure. Experimentally, quantitative sorption of analytes was observed, at all sample weights. Hence sample weight of the order of 10\u201320 g could easily be taken up for the analysis.\nThe precious metals sorbed on to AC were normally determined either directly by NAA, ETA, EDXRF or by igniting charcoal to ashes . Me et al. attempted wet ashing using several reagents to recover Au from AC, but in vain. Gold desorption from AC was attempted using sulfide and dilute NaOH/organic solvent mixtures like water\u2013acetone\u2013NaOH mix and iso propyl alcohol\u2013H2O\u2013thiourea\u2013hydroxide mix . However, in all the cases, the recoveries are not quantitative. The authors made efforts to recover Au, Ag and Pd from AC by wet ashing using several oxidising agents like nitric acid, aquaregia, bromine aquaregia, KBrO3/HBr, KMnO4 and K2Cr2O7. The thiourea at varying concentrations was also tried. But none of the reagents able to desorb Au quantitatively from AC, though Ag and Pd were recovered quantitatively using conc. HNO3. The effect of varying concentration of HNO3 and the effect of conc. HNO3 and conc. HClO4 was studied on desorption of analytes from AC. The procedure used for sorption of analytes and optimal conditions maintained were essentially the same, as given in Section 2.4. The percent recoveries for Au, Ag and Pd from AC are given in Table 5 . Only Ag and Pd were recovered quantitatively from carbon using conc. HNO3, whereas Au recovered to the extent of 40%. In an effort to completely oxidise AC to recover gold, AC was first boiled with conc. HNO3 to oxidise the easily oxidizable organic matter and later treated with conc. perchloric acid (5 ml), to oxidise and solubilise AC completely. The method of HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment of carbon, yielded quantitative recoveries for Au, Ag and Pd, which was hitherto not possible by various oxidising agents even under drastic conditions. In the present method there was no need to subject calibration standards, through the entire procedure along with samples, as the sorption of analytes were quantitative when compared with other non quantitative methods reported .\nBased on the experimental studies described above, the optimal conditions required for quantitative sorption of Au, Ag and Pd are as given below.\nSample weight \u2014 10 g (variable); sample solution volume \u2014 200 ml (variable); optimum pH \u2014 \u223c1; weight of AC \u2014 0.5 g; contact time \u2014 4 h; desorption of Ag and Pd \u2014 by conc. HNO3 (20 ml) boiling (5 min); desorption of Au, Ag and Pd \u2014 by conc. HNO3 (20 ml) boiling (5 min), followed by boiling with HClO4 (5 ml) till AC was solubalised.\nThus by simply manipulating acidity, amount of AC and duration of contact time, quantitative sorption of Au, Ag and Pd on to AC was achieved. The use of complexing agents like rhodanine , dithiozone , dithiophosphoric acid-0,0-diethyl ester or cyclohexane 1,2-dione dioxime was not necessary to achieve >90% sorption on to AC. Thus the use of reagents is avoided. The use of powdered AC in beaker instead of column provides more surface area and prolonged contact time, which facilitates quantitative sorption in HCl medium at pH 1. The sample solution volume is not a limiting factor, with the result large sample volume arising out of 10 g or more of sample could be processed to have lower determination limits.\nIn dry ashing, the AC is ignited to ashes and the ash is treated with acid to recover gold. This method of recovery of gold is tedious and time consuming, requiring atleast of about 3 h. The major disadvantage of dry ashing during ignition is, the Ag and Pd get adsorbed to container (silica crucible) to various degree, depending on the ignition temperature and time duration. At 6000\u00b0C both Ag and Pd get sorbed to silica crucible to the extent of 38 and 15%, respectively, and at 800\u00b0C it was found to be 75 and 30% and under similar conditions gold does not get sorbed on to crucible. The extent of sorption given above was confirmed by dissolving, inside surface coating of silica crucible with HF\u2013HNO3 and analysing the resultant solution for Ag and Pd. The consistent quantitative recovery of adsorbed Ag and Pd from crucible was not possible even by aqua regia treatment under drastic conditions except for gold. Hence the determination of Ag, Pd along with Au in single ashed solution is ruled out. This could be, one of the reason, why methods are largely unknown for determination of Au, Ag and Pd in the same sample solution by flame AAS through dry ash route. Hence the method of wet ashing was adopted using HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment. In this method, carbon was completely oxidised and solubilised using HNO3\u2013HClO4 leaving clear solution, for the analysis of Au, Ag and Pd. In addition, the method is expeditious and not tedious when compared with dry ashing. The method is field oriented as small preconcentrated volume could be sent to main laboratory from field lab, for flame AAS measurements.\nThere are various ways by which metals can be sorbed on to AC from aqueous medium, (a) by complexing with chelating agent , (b) by reduction in valency state and (c) by an ion exchange process at the carbon surface . In case of Au, Ag and Pd, it could be the combination of both (b) and (c), as no complexing agent is used in the present method. It is reported that some of the noble metals get reduced to elemental state at the AC surface. The sorption of Ag on to AC in 0.1N HCl medium is quantitative and less than 50% in 0.1N HNO3 and H2SO4 medium. This suggests that AgCl may be preferred by AC, whereas nitrates and sulphates partially prevent sorption. Formation and sorption of AgCl molecules is predicted by Beinrohr et al. . Further with increase in acidity of HCl, sorption of Ag on to AC drops (Table 2) and this is probably due to formation of AgCl2 \u2212 type of species, which is not favoured by AC. Formation of this type of species is reported, at high HCl concentration . In our experiments, we found almost similar behaviour of Ag and Pd with respect to (i) contact time, both Ag and Pd quantitatively sorbed on AC in about 4 h, (ii) desorption, both recovered from AC with conc. HNO3 boiling and (iii) ignition, both gets sorbed to silica crucible when charcoal ignited to ashes. Hence chloro species of Pd, may be responsible for sorption in HCl medium. The desorption of Ag and Pd with conc. HNO3 indicated that Ag and Pd are not held very strongly on to AC like Au. This could be related to, as stated earlier, long contact time for sorption of Ag/Pd (due to poor affinity towards AC) and very short contact time for Au (strong affinity towards AC). It was found experimentally that various oxidising agents and combination of acids fail to oxidise AC completely and hence Au was not recovered completely. With combination of HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment, the AC was completely oxidised and solubilised fully during Perchloric acid fuming, resulting in total recovery of Au, along with Ag and Pd. The high boiling point of HClO4 and its powerful oxidising properties, facilitates complete oxidation of AC leaving clear solution. As stated earlier, the sorption of Pt, Ru and Rh on AC is very poor due to very weak affinity towards AC.\nKeeping in view application to various geological samples in particular to gold and silver bearing minerals, sorption of various major, minor and trace elements and their interferences was studied at the pH of interest. The 200 ml of quartz double distilled water was spiked with the following amounts, 10 mg each of Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, Na, K; 200 \u03bcg each of Mn, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, V, Y, Ce, REE, U; 25 \u03bcg each of Au, Ag, and Pd. The procedure as described in Section 2.4 was followed. The sorbed elements from AC were desorbed by boiling with HNO3\u2013HClO4, made upto 25 ml in volumetric flask and aspirated into flame AAS and ICP-AES, for the determination of trace elements (as mentioned in experimental section). From the recovery values the percent sorption values are calculated back and indicated in Table 6 . The quantitative recoveries were obtained for Au, Ag and Pd in presence of various diverse ions. The Cd, Cu and U were recovered from AC in the range of 3\u20138%, and do not interfere in flame AAS determination of Au, Ag and Pd.\nThe accuracy of the method was evaluated by using international standard reference materials i.e. Canada centre for mineral and energy technology (CANMET) standards, MA-3, MA-1b (gold ores) were used to evaluate gold and FER-1 (iron formation sample), SU-1A (Ni\u2013Cu\u2013Co ore), CPB-1 (lead concentrate) were used for silver. In addition ASK-3 (sulphide ore) was used to evaluate Ag and one inhouse standard, kolar gold field (KGF, India) was used for Au. The results compare well with recommended/consensus values as seen from Table 7 . The precision of the method was evaluated by taking samples in quadruplicate and making replicate measurements. The R.S.D. of the method varies between 2 and 10%. The KGF sample (22-ppm Au) was analysed with an error of \u00b15%. The relative error obtained by present method was within \u00b110% for most of the samples. As no standard reference sample for palladium is available in our laboratory, its accuracy was evaluated by spiking four sample solutions with 10 \u03bcg of Pd. The recoveries were found to be better than 90% with an R.S.D. of \u00b110%. The sorption of most of the major elements present in geological samples at the pH of interest are minimal and does not interfere by flame AAS.\nThe detection limits (3\u00d7S.D.) were calculated using procedural blank consisting of 200 ml water (adjusted to pH \u223c1), 0.5-g AC taken through entire procedure as in Section 2.4. The detection limits (n=4) are given in Table 1. In order to overcome sample inhomogenity (nugget effect) and to determine Au, Ag and Pd down to 0.1 ppm, it is essential to start with 10 g sample. When 10-g sample containing (0.1 \u03bcg g\u22121 of Au, Ag and Pd) was taken through entire procedure and made to final volume of 10 ml, then it contains 0.1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of each analyte. This works out to be 0.1 ppm.\nThe method is simple and economical as only AC is used for preconcentration of Au, Ag and Pd, where as the reported methods make use of specific complexing reagent. The AC is the most inexpensive sorbent used in the present method. Most of the reported methods using AC for sorption of Au use the route of dry ashing to determine Au by flame AAS. This method of igniting carbon to ashes in silica crucible is not only tedious and time consuming but also results in loss of Ag and Pd due to sorption. Thus Ag and Pd cannot be determined along with Au by dry ashing. The advantages associate with the recommended wet ashing procedure (HNO3\u2013HClO4 treatment) are, (1) Au, Ag and Pd can be determined quantitatively by flame AAS in a single sample solution; (2) The ignition of AC to ashes is avoided, thus making the method relatively rapid. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by analysing standard reference materials (CANMET Standards). The percent R.S.D. of the method is \u00b110% at 0.1-ppm level based on 10-g sample. The method was applied on large number of geological samples for determination of Au, Ag and Pd. For samples where only Ag and Pd need to be determined, simple nitric acid boiling of AC, could yield quantitative recoveries. This method could be easily adopted by any laboratory as the inputs (only AC) and the operation skills required are minimal compared with methods based on co-precipitation, solvent extraction and ion exchange."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nRoom temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are salts with melting points at or close to room temperature. Typically, these salts consist of bulky organic cations, such as N-alkylpyridinium and 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium combined with an inorganic or organic anion. They represent an interesting class of solvents because they exhibit properties such as negligible vapor pressure, good thermal stability, tunable viscosity, and primarily anion-dependent miscibility with water as well as various organic solvents. In recent years, RTILs have been widely considered as alternatives to classical organic solvents and applied in organic synthesis, electrochemistry, liquid-phase extraction, catalysis for clean technology, and separations.\nAlkylimidazolium-based ionic liquids have been used as a stable stationary phase for gas chromatography. They show unusual selectivity with \u201cdual nature\u201d, separating polar compounds as if they were polar stationary phases and non-polar compounds as if they were non-polar stationary phases. Ionic liquids have also been used as electrolyte additives in capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the separation of polyphenols, basic proteins, aromatic acids, and anthraquinones. The analytes may associate with either the ionic liquid cations that coat the inner wall of the fused silica capillary or with the free ionic liquid cations in the running electrolyte solution. If covalently bonded to the capillary inner walls, RTILs provide a permanent positive charge, which in turn reverses the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in CE. In high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), RTILs have been used as a mobile phase additive for the separation of ephedrines, catecholamines, amines, and others. It was proposed that the imidazolium cations interact with the silanol groups on the surface of the silica particles, suppressing the adverse effects of free silanols in liquid chromatography. The separation of basic species and polar analytes was improved by providing better peak shape; decreased retention times were also observed. The UV absorbance and relatively high viscosity of RTILs are limitations that prevent their widespread application as mobile phase additives in HPLC.\nVery little work has been reported on the use of RTILs as stationary phases for HPLC. Arguably, when ionic liquids are diluted or immobilized on a support, they may not possess all the properties of the neat ionic liquids. Nevertheless, their potential use as stationary phases for HPLC is an intriguing concept and deserves to be explored. Very recently, and during the course of our work, the retention characteristics of a butylimidazolium-based HPLC stationary phase were studied by Stalcup and coworkers using linear solvation free energy relationships. Twenty-eight neutral, small aromatic solutes were used to study the retention properties of the new stationary phase under reversed phase conditions. They found that the 1-butyl-3-heptylimidazolium bromide stationary phase is remarkably similar to conventional phenyl-based stationary phases under reversed phase conditions. It was indicated that this new type of stationary phase shows promise for truly multi-modal retention properties, which may lead to more universally applicable separation media.\nIn this report, we present initial studies on particulate silica support material modified with two RTILs with potential use as HPLC stationary phases: 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (MPIM) and 1-n-butyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (BPIM). First, MPIM and BPIM were synthesized as alkoxysilane derivatives to allow covalent functionalization of the silica particle surface, as outlined in Fig. 1. The modified silica material was then characterized and tested under chromatographic conditions for the separation of small aromatic carboxylic acids.\np-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (pKa = 4.5 \u00b1 0.2), 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (pKa = 4.7 \u00b1 0.2), benzoic acid (pKa = 4.2 \u00b1 0.2), and HPLC grade methanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The pKa values for the aromatic acids were estimated using Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/Labs) Software Solaris V4.67 (1994\u20132005 ACD/Labs). Phosphoric acid was from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). The 3 \u00b5m Apex silica particles were purchased from Jones Chromatography (Lakewood, CO). 1-Methylimidazole (99%) and 1-butylimidazole (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and twice distilled prior to use. (3-Bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane was used as received from Gelest Inc. (Morrisville, PA). Moisture-sensitive reactions were performed in heat gun-dried glassware using standard Schlenk line techniques employing dry argon to provide an inert atmosphere.\n1-Alkyl-3-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)imidazolium bromide preparation. A slight molar excess of (3-bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane was added to fresh doubly-distilled 1-alkylimidazole in a clean, dry round bottom flask containing a PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar. After a reaction period of one full week at room temperature, any remaining volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation and the product, obtained as slightly yellow viscous oil, was washed several times with cold diethyl ether followed by drying under reduced pressure and storage over calcium sulfate.\n1-Methyl-3-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)imidazolium bromide: 91% yield, 1H NMR [400 MHz, CDCl3, \u03b4 (ppm relative to TMS)]: 9.991 (s, 1H), 7.604 (s, 1H), 7.356 (s, 1H), 4.131 (t, 2H, J = 7.2 Hz), 3.921 (s, 2H), 3.338 (s, 9H), 1.795 (m, 2H), 0.418 (t, 2H, J = 8.2 Hz).\n1-Butyl-3-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)imidazolium bromide: 96% yield, 1H NMR [400 MHz, CDCl3, \u03b4 (ppm relative to TMS)]: 10.378 (s, 1H), 7.588 (m, 1H), 7.450 (m, 1H), 4.318 (m, 4H), 3.503 (s, 9H), 1.960 (m, 2H), 1.859 (m, 2H), 1.314 (m, 2H), 0.898 (t, 3H, J = 7.4 Hz), 0.577 (t, 2H, J = 8.2 Hz).\nPreparation of ionic liquid-functionalized silica particles. In order to remove metal ion impurities, 3 \u00b5m diameter Apex (Jones Chromatography Ltd., UK) spherical silica particles (0.3 cm3 g\u22121 pore volume, 100 \u00c5 pore diameter) were initially soaked overnight in 30% HCl. The particles were then spun down in a centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant discarded, and the particles resuspended in fresh deionized water. This was repeated no less than 10 times after which the pH of the final rinse was above 5.5. The acid-treated particles were then heated in a convection oven at 70 \u00b0C for 3 h to hydroxylate the surface and subsequently dried at 90 \u00b0C overnight in a vacuum oven and cooled in a desiccator. Then, 1.20 g of treated and dried silica particles were suspended in 40 mL dry toluene in a clean, dry 125 mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a gas inlet valve. A 4-fold molar excess of the 1-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)-3-alkylimidazolium bromide salt was added while stirring. The molar excess was calculated relative to the number of silanol groups assuming a maximal surface density of 8 \u00b5mol m\u22122 for a particle surface area of 167 m2 g\u22121, as determined by BET nitrogen gas adsorption analysis. The suspension was kept at room temperature for 1 h and then allowed to proceed under reflux conditions for 18 h. The reflux condenser was held at 65 \u00b0C in order to remove the methanol by-product. After cooling, the particles were collected by filtration and exhaustively washed with methanol. The remaining methanol was removed under reduced pressure allowing the particles to dry.\nThe thermogravimetric analysis was performed using a TGA 7.0 analyzer from Perkin Elmer. All thermogravimetric measurements were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere over the temperature range of 20 to 800 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min\u22121. BET measurements were performed using ASAP 2000 instrumentation from Micromeritics. NMR experiments were performed using a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The HPLC system consisted of an ISCO DM 100 syringe pump (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE), an injector equipped with a 500 nL sample injection loop (VICI Valco, Houston, TX) and a UV detector (Thermo Spectra 100, Suncol, CA). The RTIL-modified silica particles were packed into a stainless steel column (100 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm id) by the conventional slurry packing method using acetone as the solvent. All chromatograms were obtained at room temperature with a flow rate of 200 \u00b5L min\u22121. The model compounds were monitored via UV detection at 214 nm. Data collection was performed using National Instruments Labview 6.1 software running a data collection program readily available (http://www.umich.edu/).\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 29Si NMR with cross-polarization (CP) and magic-angle spinning (MAS) was performed on the BPIM-modified silica particles to confirm attachment of the RTIL to the silica particle surface. The 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectrum, shown in Fig. 2, shows two prominent features in the region from \u221250 to \u221260 ppm, which are attributed to the silanization of the silica particle surface (T units). The two signals in the NMR spectrum at \u221250 ppm and \u221257 ppm are ascribed to SiO\u2013SiR\u2013(OMe)2 and (SiO)2\u2013SiR\u2013OMe units, respectively; in our case, the R groups correspond to the RTIL moiety. That is, the organic RTIL is predominantly bonded to the surface via either one or two Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds, although there is also a small contribution from trifunctional silane (SiO)3\u2013Si\u2013R units containing three Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds; i.e,, the shoulder appearing at \u221266 ppm. The relatively large signal at \u2212101 ppm, assigned to (SiO)3\u2013Si\u2013OH groups, suggests the presence of a large amount of unreacted hydroxyl groups and is consistent with the relatively low surface coverage estimated from TGA analysis (see below). In general, it appears that most of the RTIL species incorporated onto the silica particle are attached through the reaction of two of the methoxy groups in the parent trialkoxysilane (i.e., one alkoxy group remains unreacted). The ratio of single attachment on the silica support (i.e., two alkoxy groups remaining in the RTIL silylating agent) to double attachment (i.e., one alkoxy group left) was 1 : 2.2, which corresponds to 29% and 63%, respectively. Thus, the percentage of triple attachment where no alkoxy group remains is only about 8%. Fig. 3 compares the 13C NMR spectrum of the liquid BPIM ionosilane precursor with the solid-state NMR spectrum for BPIM-modified silica particles. The signal assignments were performed by quantum chemical calculations with analogy to the 1-methyl-3-nonylimidazolium (MNIM) cation in the [MNIM]PF6 RTIL. The NMR resonance that is present in the liquid sample at about 80 ppm is attributed to the solvent. The significant line broadening in the lower NMR spectrum, which arises from the anisotropy of the solid-state sample, makes a head-to-head comparison of the two spectra less straightforward. Clearly, however, the silanization reaction significantly impacts only the peak at 5.85 ppm associated with the carbon atom directly attached to the silicon atom in BPIM. The chemical shifts for the remaining carbon atoms in the BPIM-modified silica sample in the solid-state NMR spectrum are hardly changed. The resonance at 5.85 ppm observed in the liquid-state NMR spectrum is absent in the solid-state NMR spectrum of the modified particle and appears to have largely merged with the peak near 10 ppm.\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was performed on the silica particles modified with 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (MPIM) or with 1-n-butyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (BPIM), as well as on the unmodified particles in the temperature range of 20 to 800 \u00b0C. Based on the thermograms provided in Fig. 4, it can be seen that there is an initial loss of weight at a temperature below 100 \u00b0C for all samples. This is attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water and/or any minor solvent residues remaining from the particle modification procedures. Physically adsorbed water is removed completely by further heating to about 200 \u00b0C. Inspection of the TGA trace for the unmodified silica reveals a small, but noticeable, thermal event in the region from 250 to 600 \u00b0C. This can be attributed to dehydroxylation of the silica surface, in which silanol groups condense to siloxanes, a process known to occur in this thermal region. The modified particles, on the other hand, showed two very distinct thermal events, one occurring in the range of 250\u2013400 \u00b0C and the other in the range of 400\u2013600 \u00b0C. The first of these two regions is where the organic moieties at the surface are expected to thermally decompose. The second one is associated with decomposition of the residual methoxy side groups.\nThe weight loss of the RTIL-modified particles beyond 200 \u00b0C was compared to that of the unmodified bare silica particles and the results collected in Table 1. The dehydroxylation process on the silica surface accounts for 1.4% weight loss. The particles derivatized with MPIM and BPIM each had a total weight loss of about 7%. Using the RTIL precursor molecular weights, the weight percent loss by TGA, and the surface area for the parent silica, one can estimate the surface coverage of the RTIL-modified silica; i.e., surface coverage is equal to the total weight loss divided by the molecular weight of the phase and the surface area. The specific surface area of the silica particles, as determined by nitrogen gas adsorption BET analysis was 166.9 m2 g\u22121. Taking into account the modes of attachment onto the silica (see above), the phase coverage was estimated to be 0.84 \u00b5mol m\u22122 for both MPIM and BPIM stationary phases.\nThe MPIM- and BPIM-modified silica particles were packed into stainless steel columns and tested under reversed phase HPLC conditions. Our first investigations were performed with the MPIM-modified particles. Fig. 5 shows a separation of aromatic carboxylic acids with the MPIM stationary phase using 5 mM phosphate at pH 4.2 as the mobile phase. The retention factors of the acidic compounds in the sample mixture (equimolar p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and benzoic acid) increased with decreasing pKa values. At pH 4, the acids are partially dissociated. Therefore, hydrophobic interactions and ion-exchange were the major factors expected to be contributing to the retention. It appears that an ion-exchange mechanism predominates in the separation since 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, the compound with a stronger hydrophobic character, is less retained than p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. There is, however, the potential for multiple interactions as discussed below.\nEffect of the mobile phase. An investigation into the effects of the pH on retention factors was performed to determine the extent of ionic interactions with the RTIL stationary phase. Using a mobile phase containing phosphate buffer, we monitored the retention factor of the organic acids as a function of the mobile phase pH. Table 2 lists the retention factors of the three organic acids at various mobile phase pH values. The total ionic strength of the mobile phase was maintained at 5\u20136 mM. In anion exchange chromatography, it is typical to observe an increase in the retention of an acidic compound as the pH of the mobile phase is increased. In our experiments, however, the retention factors for all of the acidic test solutes actually decreased with an increase in pH from 4.2 to 6.4, suggesting that there are other key interactions taking place besides anion-exchange; these could be hydrophobic and/or electrostatic in nature.\nAbove pH 3, the silanol groups on the silica surface will become ionized but complete dissociation of the surface silanols is not expected until the pH is above 7. The ionized silanol groups may affect the separation either by delocalizing the positive charge on the MPIM stationary phase by electrostatic interactions or by repelling negatively-charged analyte species by direct electrostatic interaction. Fig. 6 depicts a scenario for potential RTIL conformation on the silica surface that is consistent with our 29Si NMR results. The two effects can contribute to the observed minimal ion exchange interactions at pH 6.4. The acids were observed to elute in the order of increasing hydrophobic interaction, which indicates that hydrophobic, rather than ion exchange interactions are stronger in this case. As the pH is decreased the silanols become protonated and the two proposed effects caused by the silanols should diminish. Decreasing the pH to 5.2 resulted in an increased retention, maintaining the same elution order. As the pH was reduced further to 4.2, the elution order of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid was inverted while benzoic acid remained the most retained compound. At this pH, the elution order corresponded to a decrease in pKa, indicating a strong dependence on the ionic character of the test solute. By decreasing the pH to 3, the retention factors decreased considerably. At pH 3.2, the ionization of silanol groups is very limited, and the cationic moiety of the ionic liquid phase would be expected to have much less interaction with the silanols. At the same time, however, the tests solutes are much less ionized, with the neutral form of all analyte species predominating. Under such conditions, the ionic interactions with the cationic moiety of the stationary phase are reduced, and hence so is retention. At pH = 3.2, the retention of the test solutes appeared to be influenced by hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions.\nIn general, for the solutes tested and at a mobile phase pH above the solutes' pKa values, one would expect strong ionic exchange interactions with the imidazolium moiety of the RTIL. It is also likely, however, to have interactions between the imidazolium group and the silica silanol groups. This would lead to the observed diminished ionic interactions of the test solute with the stationary phase. At a pH below the solute's pKa, the ionization of the silanols is suppressed; however, the ionization of the test compounds is also suppressed, minimizing ionic interactions. It is at a pH closer to the pKa of the test solutes that all the contributors to retention are maximized, with an apparent major contribution from the ionic interactions. Varying ionic strength slightly and the amount of organic modifier in the mobile phase did not show much influence on the retention factors of these acidic analytes.\n1-n-Butyl-3-propylimidazolium stationary phase. The BPIM stationary phase was tested under the same conditions as for the MPIM-based stationary phase. The most significant difference was that the test compounds were retained slightly longer, which was expected due to the longer hydrocarbon chain contributing to hydrophobic interactions; the resolution of the test compounds, however, did not improve. At pH 4, the separation of 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid on the BPIM stationary phase was less efficient than with the MPIM phase as shown in Fig. 7. As discussed previously, the influence on the elution order of the acids from ion exchange interactions is predominating at a pH close to the pKa of the test solutes. In the case where the BPIM was used, the contribution to retention due to hydrophobic interactions is contrary to that of the ion exchange mechanism and therefore has a negative impact on the entire separation as compared to the shorter-chained MPIM phase. Consequently, the worst separation with the BPIM stationary phase was observed near pH 4. These results further corroborate the idea that the acids were separated with the MPIM and BPIM stationary phases under multiple interactions.\nIn summary, two imidazolium RTIL ionosilane derivatives were synthesized and bonded to silica particles for use in HPLC. NMR and TGA analyses corroborated the successful attachment of the derivatives to the silica particles. The attachment protocol rendered modified particles with a relatively low surface coverage (i.e., \u223c0.8 \u00b5mol m\u22122) and efforts are currently dedicated to improving the surface coverage. Nevertheless, the modified particles were suitable to study the initial characteristics of this novel type of stationary phase. Obviously, more in-depth studies are required to fully understand the mechanism of retention of these stationary phases and the effects of using different alkyl-chains or functional units on the imidazolium cation (or other cation types) as well as the counter ion. These initial efforts demonstrate the feasibility of preparing and bonding the RTIL on the silica surface, adding to the use of RTIL in analytical chemistry. As also pointed out by Stalcup and coworkers, immobilized RTILs may bring forth new types of HPLC stationary phases with mixed-mode selectivities; the preparation and particularly the study of these phases for HPLC, however, can be considered to be in its infancy.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

Typically, these salts consist of bulky organic cations, such as N-alkylpyridinium and 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium combined with an inorganic or organic anion. They represent an interesting class of solvents because they exhibit properties such as negligible vapor pressure, good thermal stability, tunable viscosity, and primarily anion-dependent miscibility with water as well as various organic solvents. In recent years, RTILs have been widely considered as alternatives to classical organic solvents and applied in organic synthesis, electrochemistry, liquid-phase extraction, catalysis for clean technology, and separations.\nAlkylimidazolium-based ionic liquids have been used as a stable stationary phase for gas chromatography. They show unusual selectivity with \u201cdual nature\u201d, separating polar compounds as if they were polar stationary phases and non-polar compounds as if they were non-polar stationary phases. Ionic liquids have also been used as electrolyte additives in capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the separation of polyphenols, basic proteins, aromatic acids, and anthraquinones. The analytes may associate with either the ionic liquid cations that coat the inner wall of the fused silica capillary or with the free ionic liquid cations in the running electrolyte solution. If covalently bonded to the capillary inner walls, RTILs provide a permanent positive charge, which in turn reverses the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in CE. In high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), RTILs have been used as a mobile phase additive for the separation of ephedrines, catecholamines, amines, and others. It was proposed that the imidazolium cations interact with the silanol groups on the surface of the silica particles, suppressing the adverse effects of free silanols in liquid chromatography. The separation of basic species and polar analytes was improved by providing better peak shape; decreased retention times were also observed. The UV absorbance and relatively high viscosity of RTILs are limitations that prevent their widespread application as mobile phase additives in HPLC.\nVery little work has been reported on the use of RTILs as stationary phases for HPLC. Arguably, when ionic liquids are diluted or immobilized on a support, they may not possess all the properties of the neat ionic liquids. Nevertheless, their potential use as stationary phases for HPLC is an intriguing concept and deserves to be explored. Very recently, and during the course of our work, the retention characteristics of a butylimidazolium-based HPLC stationary phase were studied by Stalcup and coworkers using linear solvation free energy relationships. Twenty-eight neutral, small aromatic solutes were used to study the retention properties of the new stationary phase under reversed phase conditions. They found that the 1-butyl-3-heptylimidazolium bromide stationary phase is remarkably similar to conventional phenyl-based stationary phases under reversed phase conditions. It was indicated that this new type of stationary phase shows promise for truly multi-modal retention properties, which may lead to more universally applicable separation media.\nIn this report, we present initial studies on particulate silica support material modified with two RTILs with potential use as HPLC stationary phases: 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (MPIM) and 1-n-butyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (BPIM). First, MPIM and BPIM were synthesized as alkoxysilane derivatives to allow covalent functionalization of the silica particle surface, as outlined in Fig. 1. The modified silica material was then characterized and tested under chromatographic conditions for the separation of small aromatic carboxylic acids.\np-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (pKa = 4.5 \u00b1 0.2), 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (pKa = 4.7 \u00b1 0.2), benzoic acid (pKa = 4.2 \u00b1 0.2), and HPLC grade methanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The pKa values for the aromatic acids were estimated using Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/Labs) Software Solaris V4.67 (1994\u20132005 ACD/Labs). Phosphoric acid was from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). The 3 \u00b5m Apex silica particles were purchased from Jones Chromatography (Lakewood, CO). 1-Methylimidazole (99%) and 1-butylimidazole (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and twice distilled prior to use. (3-Bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane was used as received from Gelest Inc. (Morrisville, PA). Moisture-sensitive reactions were performed in heat gun-dried glassware using standard Schlenk line techniques employing dry argon to provide an inert atmosphere.\n1-Alkyl-3-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)imidazolium bromide preparation. A slight molar excess of (3-bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane was added to fresh doubly-distilled 1-alkylimidazole in a clean, dry round bottom flask containing a PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar. After a reaction period of one full week at room temperature, any remaining volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation and the product, obtained as slightly yellow viscous oil, was washed several times with cold diethyl ether followed by drying under reduced pressure and storage over calcium sulfate.\n1-Methyl-3-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)imidazolium bromide: 91% yield, 1H NMR [400 MHz, CDCl3, \u03b4 (ppm relative to TMS)]: 9.991 (s, 1H), 7.604 (s, 1H), 7.356 (s, 1H), 4.131 (t, 2H, J = 7.2 Hz), 3.921 (s, 2H), 3.338 (s, 9H), 1.795 (m, 2H), 0.418 (t, 2H, J = 8.2 Hz).\n1-Butyl-3-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)imidazolium bromide: 96% yield, 1H NMR [400 MHz, CDCl3, \u03b4 (ppm relative to TMS)]: 10.378 (s, 1H), 7.588 (m, 1H), 7.450 (m, 1H), 4.318 (m, 4H), 3.503 (s, 9H), 1.960 (m, 2H), 1.859 (m, 2H), 1.314 (m, 2H), 0.898 (t, 3H, J = 7.4 Hz), 0.577 (t, 2H, J = 8.2 Hz).\nPreparation of ionic liquid-functionalized silica particles. In order to remove metal ion impurities, 3 \u00b5m diameter Apex (Jones Chromatography Ltd., UK) spherical silica particles (0.3 cm3 g\u22121 pore volume, 100 \u00c5 pore diameter) were initially soaked overnight in 30% HCl. The particles were then spun down in a centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant discarded, and the particles resuspended in fresh deionized water. This was repeated no less than 10 times after which the pH of the final rinse was above 5.5. The acid-treated particles were then heated in a convection oven at 70 \u00b0C for 3 h to hydroxylate the surface and subsequently dried at 90 \u00b0C overnight in a vacuum oven and cooled in a desiccator. Then, 1.20 g of treated and dried silica particles were suspended in 40 mL dry toluene in a clean, dry 125 mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a gas inlet valve. A 4-fold molar excess of the 1-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)-3-alkylimidazolium bromide salt was added while stirring. The molar excess was calculated relative to the number of silanol groups assuming a maximal surface density of 8 \u00b5mol m\u22122 for a particle surface area of 167 m2 g\u22121, as determined by BET nitrogen gas adsorption analysis. The suspension was kept at room temperature for 1 h and then allowed to proceed under reflux conditions for 18 h. The reflux condenser was held at 65 \u00b0C in order to remove the methanol by-product. After cooling, the particles were collected by filtration and exhaustively washed with methanol. The remaining methanol was removed under reduced pressure allowing the particles to dry.\nThe thermogravimetric analysis was performed using a TGA 7.0 analyzer from Perkin Elmer. All thermogravimetric measurements were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere over the temperature range of 20 to 800 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min\u22121. BET measurements were performed using ASAP 2000 instrumentation from Micromeritics. NMR experiments were performed using a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The HPLC system consisted of an ISCO DM 100 syringe pump (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE), an injector equipped with a 500 nL sample injection loop (VICI Valco, Houston, TX) and a UV detector (Thermo Spectra 100, Suncol, CA). The RTIL-modified silica particles were packed into a stainless steel column (100 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm id) by the conventional slurry packing method using acetone as the solvent. All chromatograms were obtained at room temperature with a flow rate of 200 \u00b5L min\u22121. The model compounds were monitored via UV detection at 214 nm. Data collection was performed using National Instruments Labview 6.1 software running a data collection program readily available (http://www.umich.edu/).\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 29Si NMR with cross-polarization (CP) and magic-angle spinning (MAS) was performed on the BPIM-modified silica particles to confirm attachment of the RTIL to the silica particle surface. The 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectrum, shown in Fig. 2, shows two prominent features in the region from \u221250 to \u221260 ppm, which are attributed to the silanization of the silica particle surface (T units). The two signals in the NMR spectrum at \u221250 ppm and \u221257 ppm are ascribed to SiO\u2013SiR\u2013(OMe)2 and (SiO)2\u2013SiR\u2013OMe units, respectively; in our case, the R groups correspond to the RTIL moiety. That is, the organic RTIL is predominantly bonded to the surface via either one or two Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds, although there is also a small contribution from trifunctional silane (SiO)3\u2013Si\u2013R units containing three Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds; i.e,, the shoulder appearing at \u221266 ppm. The relatively large signal at \u2212101 ppm, assigned to (SiO)3\u2013Si\u2013OH groups, suggests the presence of a large amount of unreacted hydroxyl groups and is consistent with the relatively low surface coverage estimated from TGA analysis (see below). In general, it appears that most of the RTIL species incorporated onto the silica particle are attached through the reaction of two of the methoxy groups in the parent trialkoxysilane (i.e., one alkoxy group remains unreacted). The ratio of single attachment on the silica support (i.e., two alkoxy groups remaining in the RTIL silylating agent) to double attachment (i.e., one alkoxy group left) was 1 : 2.2, which corresponds to 29% and 63%, respectively. Thus, the percentage of triple attachment where no alkoxy group remains is only about 8%. Fig. 3 compares the 13C NMR spectrum of the liquid BPIM ionosilane precursor with the solid-state NMR spectrum for BPIM-modified silica particles. The signal assignments were performed by quantum chemical calculations with analogy to the 1-methyl-3-nonylimidazolium (MNIM) cation in the [MNIM]PF6 RTIL. The NMR resonance that is present in the liquid sample at about 80 ppm is attributed to the solvent. The significant line broadening in the lower NMR spectrum, which arises from the anisotropy of the solid-state sample, makes a head-to-head comparison of the two spectra less straightforward. Clearly, however, the silanization reaction significantly impacts only the peak at 5.85 ppm associated with the carbon atom directly attached to the silicon atom in BPIM. The chemical shifts for the remaining carbon atoms in the BPIM-modified silica sample in the solid-state NMR spectrum are hardly changed. The resonance at 5.85 ppm observed in the liquid-state NMR spectrum is absent in the solid-state NMR spectrum of the modified particle and appears to have largely merged with the peak near 10 ppm.\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was performed on the silica particles modified with 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (MPIM) or with 1-n-butyl-3-propylimidazolium bromide (BPIM), as well as on the unmodified particles in the temperature range of 20 to 800 \u00b0C. Based on the thermograms provided in Fig. 4, it can be seen that there is an initial loss of weight at a temperature below 100 \u00b0C for all samples. This is attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water and/or any minor solvent residues remaining from the particle modification procedures. Physically adsorbed water is removed completely by further heating to about 200 \u00b0C. Inspection of the TGA trace for the unmodified silica reveals a small, but noticeable, thermal event in the region from 250 to 600 \u00b0C. This can be attributed to dehydroxylation of the silica surface, in which silanol groups condense to siloxanes, a process known to occur in this thermal region. The modified particles, on the other hand, showed two very distinct thermal events, one occurring in the range of 250\u2013400 \u00b0C and the other in the range of 400\u2013600 \u00b0C. The first of these two regions is where the organic moieties at the surface are expected to thermally decompose. The second one is associated with decomposition of the residual methoxy side groups.\nThe weight loss of the RTIL-modified particles beyond 200 \u00b0C was compared to that of the unmodified bare silica particles and the results collected in Table 1. The dehydroxylation process on the silica surface accounts for 1.4% weight loss. The particles derivatized with MPIM and BPIM each had a total weight loss of about 7%. Using the RTIL precursor molecular weights, the weight percent loss by TGA, and the surface area for the parent silica, one can estimate the surface coverage of the RTIL-modified silica; i.e., surface coverage is equal to the total weight loss divided by the molecular weight of the phase and the surface area. The specific surface area of the silica particles, as determined by nitrogen gas adsorption BET analysis was 166.9 m2 g\u22121. Taking into account the modes of attachment onto the silica (see above), the phase coverage was estimated to be 0.84 \u00b5mol m\u22122 for both MPIM and BPIM stationary phases.\nThe MPIM- and BPIM-modified silica particles were packed into stainless steel columns and tested under reversed phase HPLC conditions. Our first investigations were performed with the MPIM-modified particles. Fig. 5 shows a separation of aromatic carboxylic acids with the MPIM stationary phase using 5 mM phosphate at pH 4.2 as the mobile phase. The retention factors of the acidic compounds in the sample mixture (equimolar p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and benzoic acid) increased with decreasing pKa values. At pH 4, the acids are partially dissociated. Therefore, hydrophobic interactions and ion-exchange were the major factors expected to be contributing to the retention. It appears that an ion-exchange mechanism predominates in the separation since 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, the compound with a stronger hydrophobic character, is less retained than p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. There is, however, the potential for multiple interactions as discussed below.\nEffect of the mobile phase. An investigation into the effects of the pH on retention factors was performed to determine the extent of ionic interactions with the RTIL stationary phase. Using a mobile phase containing phosphate buffer, we monitored the retention factor of the organic acids as a function of the mobile phase pH. Table 2 lists the retention factors of the three organic acids at various mobile phase pH values. The total ionic strength of the mobile phase was maintained at 5\u20136 mM. In anion exchange chromatography, it is typical to observe an increase in the retention of an acidic compound as the pH of the mobile phase is increased. In our experiments, however, the retention factors for all of the acidic test solutes actually decreased with an increase in pH from 4.2 to 6.4, suggesting that there are other key interactions taking place besides anion-exchange; these could be hydrophobic and/or electrostatic in nature.\nAbove pH 3, the silanol groups on the silica surface will become ionized but complete dissociation of the surface silanols is not expected until the pH is above 7. The ionized silanol groups may affect the separation either by delocalizing the positive charge on the MPIM stationary phase by electrostatic interactions or by repelling negatively-charged analyte species by direct electrostatic interaction. Fig. 6 depicts a scenario for potential RTIL conformation on the silica surface that is consistent with our 29Si NMR results. The two effects can contribute to the observed minimal ion exchange interactions at pH 6.4. The acids were observed to elute in the order of increasing hydrophobic interaction, which indicates that hydrophobic, rather than ion exchange interactions are stronger in this case. As the pH is decreased the silanols become protonated and the two proposed effects caused by the silanols should diminish. Decreasing the pH to 5.2 resulted in an increased retention, maintaining the same elution order. As the pH was reduced further to 4.2, the elution order of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid was inverted while benzoic acid remained the most retained compound. At this pH, the elution order corresponded to a decrease in pKa, indicating a strong dependence on the ionic character of the test solute. By decreasing the pH to 3, the retention factors decreased considerably. At pH 3.2, the ionization of silanol groups is very limited, and the cationic moiety of the ionic liquid phase would be expected to have much less interaction with the silanols. At the same time, however, the tests solutes are much less ionized, with the neutral form of all analyte species predominating. Under such conditions, the ionic interactions with the cationic moiety of the stationary phase are reduced, and hence so is retention. At pH = 3.2, the retention of the test solutes appeared to be influenced by hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions.\nIn general, for the solutes tested and at a mobile phase pH above the solutes' pKa values, one would expect strong ionic exchange interactions with the imidazolium moiety of the RTIL. It is also likely, however, to have interactions between the imidazolium group and the silica silanol groups. This would lead to the observed diminished ionic interactions of the test solute with the stationary phase. At a pH below the solute's pKa, the ionization of the silanols is suppressed; however, the ionization of the test compounds is also suppressed, minimizing ionic interactions. It is at a pH closer to the pKa of the test solutes that all the contributors to retention are maximized, with an apparent major contribution from the ionic interactions. Varying ionic strength slightly and the amount of organic modifier in the mobile phase did not show much influence on the retention factors of these acidic analytes.\n1-n-Butyl-3-propylimidazolium stationary phase. The BPIM stationary phase was tested under the same conditions as for the MPIM-based stationary phase. The most significant difference was that the test compounds were retained slightly longer, which was expected due to the longer hydrocarbon chain contributing to hydrophobic interactions; the resolution of the test compounds, however, did not improve. At pH 4, the separation of 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid on the BPIM stationary phase was less efficient than with the MPIM phase as shown in Fig. 7. As discussed previously, the influence on the elution order of the acids from ion exchange interactions is predominating at a pH close to the pKa of the test solutes. In the case where the BPIM was used, the contribution to retention due to hydrophobic interactions is contrary to that of the ion exchange mechanism and therefore has a negative impact on the entire separation as compared to the shorter-chained MPIM phase. Consequently, the worst separation with the BPIM stationary phase was observed near pH 4. These results further corroborate the idea that the acids were separated with the MPIM and BPIM stationary phases under multiple interactions.\nIn summary, two imidazolium RTIL ionosilane derivatives were synthesized and bonded to silica particles for use in HPLC. NMR and TGA analyses corroborated the successful attachment of the derivatives to the silica particles. The attachment protocol rendered modified particles with a relatively low surface coverage (i.e., \u223c0.8 \u00b5mol m\u22122) and efforts are currently dedicated to improving the surface coverage. Nevertheless, the modified particles were suitable to study the initial characteristics of this novel type of stationary phase. Obviously, more in-depth studies are required to fully understand the mechanism of retention of these stationary phases and the effects of using different alkyl-chains or functional units on the imidazolium cation (or other cation types) as well as the counter ion. These initial efforts demonstrate the feasibility of preparing and bonding the RTIL on the silica surface, adding to the use of RTIL in analytical chemistry. As also pointed out by Stalcup and coworkers, immobilized RTILs may bring forth new types of HPLC stationary phases with mixed-mode selectivities; the preparation and particularly the study of these phases for HPLC, however, can be considered to be in its infancy."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nIn recent years, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has been attracting much attention due to its high energy conversion efficiency and low cost . Many investigations have focused on the following issues: synthesis of dye molecules , theoretical analysis of charge-transport processes , development of quasi-solid state or solid-state electrolytes , fabrication of new style cells , etc. However, only a few studies have been performed on the counter electrode of the DSC .\nThe counter electrode widely used in DSC is constructed of conducting glass substrates coated with Pt films, where the platinum acts as a catalyst. Although this type of counter electrode has a better performance, it is expensive, because the two conducting glass substrates are estimated to be about 60% of the total cost of the DSC . In addition, glass has shape limitations and is fragile. Therefore, in order to reduce the cost of the DSCs and broaden their applications, such as a flexible film cell, it is necessary to develop novel counter electrodes based on other substrates.\nSo far, Suzuki et al. and Imoto et al. have used carbon as counter electrodes, and Saito et al. used chemically polymerized poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on a conductive glass as the counter electrode, and a conductive polymer film (PET) was also used instead of the expensive conductive glass substrate . However, the conversion efficiencies of the DSCs based on these new types of counter electrodes were low.\nMetal sheets or foils, e.g., stainless steel, have excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, and are inexpensive. It is expected that the application of a metal substrate as a solar cell electrode can not only reduce the fabrication cost of the cell, but can also contribute to improving the performance of the solar cell by reducing the internal resistance.\nOn the other hand, plastic substrates have advantages in terms of flexibility, weight, and handling. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in flexible DSCs based on the polymer film instead of FTO glass, and several attempts have been made to manufacture a flexible photoanode by depositing a nanostructured TiO2 layer on a plastic substrate, as mentioned above. However, less attention has been paid to other plastic films as counter electrodes.\nWe have been performing systematic studies of counter electrodes, including the effect of the Pt film thickness on the performance of the DSCs, and the development of novel substrate materials for the counter electrode .\nIn this paper, we report the properties of several metal and plastic counter electrodes, such as sheet resistances, stability, and the performance of the fabricated DSCs.\nSeveral metal sheets (stainless steel, SUS304; nickel, aluminum, and copper; Nilaco Co. Ltd.) were used as the counter electrode substrates for the DSCs. A polyester film (OHP, Sakurai Co. Ltd.), polystyrene, polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene naphthalate film coated with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO-PEN, Tobi Co., Ltd.) were also used as the counter electrodes substrates. The corrosion stabilities of the substrates in an electrolyte solution were observed and measured using a polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Z-6100, Hitachi). The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile.\nPlatinized counter electrodes were fabricated using sputtering instruments (TOKUDA, MODEL CFS-4ES-231USC and PMC-5000 Plasma multicoater). For comparison, platinized glass counter electrodes based on a conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2 overlayer, FTO, Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.) and a glass slide were also fabricated. Thermal deposition and electrochemical deposition were also used to coat the Pt film on the metal and plastic substrates. A platinum nanoparticle solution was prepared according to the procedure described in a previous paper .\nThe sheet resistances (R sh) of the substrates and the platinized counter electrodes were measured by the four-dot method (HL5500 PC Hall effect measurement system).\nPorous TiO2 photoelectrodes were fabricated using a screen-printing technique on the FTO glass. The TiO2 paste was prepared from TiO2 powder (P25, Nippon Aerosil; ST-01, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd.) and polyethylene glycol 600, according to the procedure described in our previous paper . The area and thickness of the TiO2 electrode were 0.2 cm2 and ca. 17 \u03bcm. The TiO2 films were immersed in an ethanol solution of cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)-bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719 dye, 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) for 12 h at 25 \u00b0C.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to determine the series resistance of the DSCs. For EIS measurements, a sandwich cell consisting of a TiO2 electrode platinized on an FTO glass sheet and a counter electrode of different substrates, between which a Surlyn film (Dupont, 50 \u03bcm) was inserted as a spacer, was used. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3- propylimidazolium iodine, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in methoxypropionitrile. EIS spectra were obtained at zero bias potential and 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range of 0.05\u2013105 Hz.\nCurrent\u2013voltage curves of the DSCs were obtained by scanning a bias voltage while measuring the photocurrents under white light irradiation (100 mW/cm2) using a sandwich solar cell constructed of the dye-anchored TiO2 electrode and the platinized counter electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp (Ushio Inc., Japan) served as a light source. The photon flux impinging on the cell was determined by a power meter (Nova, Ophir Optronics Ltd.) and a calibration cell (BS-520, s/n 019, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd.). The cells were sealed with Amosil 4 (Solaronix SA) and a 50-\u03bcm thick polymer film was inserted as a spacer (Mitsuidenpo Co., Ltd.) between the two electrodes. For the cell consisting of the ITO-PEN counter electrode, the cell was sealed by the spacer film. The electrolyte solution was introduced through small holes drilled in the counter electrode.\nIt is known that the performance of the solar cell is directly influenced by the sheet resistance (R sh), especially for a large unit cell. We measured the sheet resistances of the substrates and the platinized counter electrodes used in this study, and these results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . It can be seen that no obvious changes in the R sh of the metal sheet and the three types of ITO-PEN films were observed after sputtering a Pt layer. On the other hand, the R sh for the electrically insulating substrates, e.g., glass sheet and polyester film, were drastically reduced to 39 and 61 \u03a9/sq after coating with the 50-nm-thick Pt film. For the metal counter electrodes, the sheet resistance is very low, only 1/10,000 or 1/100,000 of those of FTO glass and ITO-PEN substrate sputtered Pt film, as shown in Table 1. A low sheet resistance of the electrode substrate is a key point in improving the performance of the DSCs. A discussion regarding this point is provided in Section 3.4.\nAn approximately 50 nm thick Pt film was sputtered on the metal sheet under high power (200 mW, 12 min) and a mirror like film was observed. For the plastic substrates, however, cracking or deformation of the substrate occurred under the same conditions. Instead, the Pt film on the plastic substrates was deposited under mild conditions (20 mA, 3 min).\nWe also attempted two other methods, i.e., thermal deposition and electrodeposition. The thermal deposition procedure was as follows: the platinum nanoparticle solution was coated on the metal sheet by a spin coater, and then sintered to the metal sheet at 385 \u00b0C for 15 min. On the contrary, for the ITO-PEN substrates, because the thermal treatment at 250 \u00b0C caused a drastic deformation of the substrates before the solution of nanoparticles was evaporated, the Pt films on the plastic substrates were deposited using a plating process and a sputtering method at room temperature. The thicknesses of the Pt-layers deposited by thermal deposition and plating deposition was controlled at ca. 50 nm.\nThe corrosion stabilities of the metal and plastic substrates in the electrolyte solution were examined. These results are summarized in Table 1. We observed that the Cu and Al foils dissolved in the electrolyte, and the color of the electrolyte changed from brown to colorless. On the other hand, no changes in the color for the stainless steel and Ni sheets were observed. The atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements have verified that the stainless steel and Ni sheet have a good stability in the electrolyte solution for 3 months; the details of this have been described in a previous communication . For the plastic substrates, the polystyrene film dissolved slightly in the electrolyte solution at ambient temperature, whereas no changes for the polyester (OHP) and ITO-PEN film were observed after immersion in the electrolyte solution at 60 \u00b0C and at ambient temperature for 3 months. These results indicated that the polyester (OHP) and ITO-PEN films were stable in the electrolyte solution.\nWe investigated the performances of DSCs based on counter electrodes of various substrates. The characteristics of the DSCs are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 .\nThe primary conversion efficiency for the DSCs based on the stainless steel and Ni electrodes reached only 4.8% and 4.7%, respectively . After optimization of the thickness of the Pt layer coated on the metal substrates and the sputtering power, the conversion efficiencies were improved to 5.3% and 5.1%, respectively. It should be noted that these overall conversion efficiencies were high when using the P25 photoelectrode and could be almost comparable to that based on the FTO glass counter electrode.\nTable 4 shows the performance of DSCs having plastic counter electrodes. The DSC with the ITO-PEN electrode exhibited a relatively higher conversion efficiency (4.2\u20135.4%). On the other hand, the DSCs based on the polyethylene, polystyrene, and OHP electrodes showed relatively low performances. These results were considered to be due to the higher sheet resistance for these counter electrodes than those of the FTO glass and ITO-PEN electrodes, although the sheet resistances were improved using the coated Pt film. Because the series resistance R s of the cell is considered to consist of the sheet resistance of the electrode substrate (R sh), the resistance of the porous TiO2 electrode and the resistance of the electrolyte , R s therefore directly influences the fill factor of the j\u2013V curve; that is a higher series resistance implies a lower fill factor, as was pointed out by the referee.\nIn order to compare the R sh of DSCs with different counter electrode substrates, the R sh values were determined by EIS measurements and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . The equivalent circuit for this type of solar cell was described in the literature . For high frequencies around 100 kHz, the impedance is dominated by the serial resistance (R s). The R s values of DSC with different substrates were 18\u201353 \u03a9 for a 0.20 cm2 active area. The R s values of DSCs with stainless steel, FTO, ITO-PEN, and OHP substrates increase in that order, and the R sh values also increase. For the DSC based on the polyester counter electrode, higher R s and R sh values resulted in a lower fill factor of 49%.\nFurthermore, to compare the relation between the electrode R sh and the performance of the DSC, we chose the three types of ITO-PEN films with different R sh value (16, 27, 62 \u03a9/sq) as the counter electrode substrates. The performance characteristics obtained are shown in Table 4. It was evident that the conversion efficiency decreased with the increase in the electrode R sh; that is, when the R sh of the counter electrode increases by about a factor of 3.9, the fill factor is reduced by ca. 10%, as is the conversion efficiency. Because the j\u2013V characteristics of the DSC can be treated by Eq. (1) as those of a p\u2013n junction solar cell , the relation between the R s and the current density is comprehensible. j=jsc-j0[exp(qV+Rsj/nkT)-1].\nRegarding the performance of DSCs with polystyrene and polyethylene substrates, although the R sh is in the same range as that of the ITO-PEN 150, there was no conductive layer on the substrate. Consequently, the current collection may be affected and result in a lower current density. Also, we estimated that the density of Pt coated on these substrates was not higher than that of the ITO-PEN.\nFurthermore, to elucidate how the size of the cell influences the performances of the DSCs, we compared the conversion efficiencies of DSCs with four different electrode areas of 0.5, 1.0, 2.2, and 4.0 cm2, which were fabricated with both stainless steel and FTO glass counter electrodes. Fig. 1 shows the relation between them. With the increase in the active area of the DSCs, the conversion efficiencies and fill factors of the cells were decreased. However, the rate of decrease for the metal electrode was not faster than that of the FTO glass electrode, and a cross-over point can be seen at 0.6 cm2, as shown in Fig. 1. This means that use of the stainless steel counter electrode improved the fill factor and conversion efficiency of the DSC by reducing the internal resistance of the large size cell. These results indicated that the reduction of the electrode R sh is very important in improving the performance of the larger size solar cell.\nFig. 2 shows the photocurrent\u2013voltage curves of the DSCs based on the stainless steel counter electrodes coated with a Pt layer using three different methods, that is, sputtering, thermal deposition, and electrodeposition. A relatively higher short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor for the DSC based on the sputtered Pt counter electrode were obtained. However, for the DSC based on the counter electrode using thermal deposition, the open voltage (V oc) and the fill factor were lower. For the cell fabricated using the electrodeposited counter electrode, only 5.2 mA of photocurrent was obtained. These results indicate that, although the counter electrodes prepared from the nanoparticle colloid have porous surfaces, i.e, have a relative high catalytic activity, the adhesion of the Pt layer with the substrate was not good. For the electrodeposited counter electrode, the porosity rather than the adhesion was not good. As mentioned in our previous paper, the catalytic activity and the adhesion of the Pt layer are very important for the performance of DSCs , therefore, it is considered that these are some reasons for the reduction of the energy conversion efficiency.\nThe efficiency and stability of the DSCs based on two typical counter electrodes, i.e., the stainless steel sheet and ITO-PEN film, have been studied under continuous illumination by monitoring the j\u2013V characteristics with time. Because we found that the cell fabricated by the P25 photoelectrode and the FTO glass had significant degradation after continuous illumination for 160 h (the details will be reported elsewhere), ST-01 photoelectrodes were used in this study. The stabilities of the DSCs based on the stainless steel and the ITO-PEN counter electrodes were tested over 553 h. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the open circuit voltage (V oc) was almost unchanged; however, a gradual decrease in the photocurrent and the solar energy conversation efficiency of the DSCs was observed. The overall solar energy conversation efficiency for the stainless steel and ITO-PEN were reduced by 52% and 48%, respectively. On the contrary, a reference cell based on the FTO glass was stable within the same time period. The reduction of conversation efficiency for the stainless steel and ITO-PEN cell were attributed to the difficulty of cell sealing and the coating state of the Pt film as the catalyst. Further studies of cell sealing and Pt coating methods on the metal and plastic substrates are necessary.\nWe investigated the properties of DSCs based on several metal and plastic counter electrodes. It was clarified that the stainless steel, Ni, and the ITO-PEN film coated Pt layer had good stabilities in the electrolyte solution. High conversion efficiencies of the DSCs fabricated using the metal substrates and the ITO-PEN film as counter electrodes were obtained, which were almost comparable to that of the FTO glass. In addition, the stainless steel counter electrode showed an important advantage, that is, its excellent electric conductivity, which improved the fill factor and conversion efficiency for the large-size DSC due to the reduced internal resistance of the cell. We believe these novel counter electrodes could be very useful for reducing the manufacturing costs of DSCs, enlarging the size of the DSCs, and developing new style flexible DSCs.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "In recent years, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has been attracting much attention due to its high energy conversion efficiency and low cost . Many investigations have focused on the following issues: synthesis of dye molecules , theoretical analysis of charge-transport processes , development of quasi-solid state or solid-state electrolytes , fabrication of new style cells , etc. However, only a few studies have been performed on the counter electrode of the DSC .\nThe counter electrode widely used in DSC is constructed of conducting glass substrates coated with Pt films, where the platinum acts as a catalyst. Although this type of counter electrode has a better performance, it is expensive, because the two conducting glass substrates are estimated to be about 60% of the total cost of the DSC . In addition, glass has shape limitations and is fragile. Therefore, in order to reduce the cost of the DSCs and broaden their applications, such as a flexible film cell, it is necessary to develop novel counter electrodes based on other substrates.\nSo far, Suzuki et al. and Imoto et al. have used carbon as counter electrodes, and Saito et al. used chemically polymerized poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on a conductive glass as the counter electrode, and a conductive polymer film (PET) was also used instead of the expensive conductive glass substrate . However, the conversion efficiencies of the DSCs based on these new types of counter electrodes were low.\nMetal sheets or foils, e.g., stainless steel, have excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, and are inexpensive. It is expected that the application of a metal substrate as a solar cell electrode can not only reduce the fabrication cost of the cell, but can also contribute to improving the performance of the solar cell by reducing the internal resistance.\nOn the other hand, plastic substrates have advantages in terms of flexibility, weight, and handling. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in flexible DSCs based on the polymer film instead of FTO glass, and several attempts have been made to manufacture a flexible photoanode by depositing a nanostructured TiO2 layer on a plastic substrate, as mentioned above. However, less attention has been paid to other plastic films as counter electrodes.\nWe have been performing systematic studies of counter electrodes, including the effect of the Pt film thickness on the performance of the DSCs, and the development of novel substrate materials for the counter electrode .\nIn this paper, we report the properties of several metal and plastic counter electrodes, such as sheet resistances, stability, and the performance of the fabricated DSCs.\nSeveral metal sheets (stainless steel, SUS304; nickel, aluminum, and copper; Nilaco Co. Ltd.) were used as the counter electrode substrates for the DSCs. A polyester film (OHP, Sakurai Co. Ltd.), polystyrene, polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene naphthalate film coated with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO-PEN, Tobi Co., Ltd.) were also used as the counter electrodes substrates. The corrosion stabilities of the substrates in an electrolyte solution were observed and measured using a polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Z-6100, Hitachi). The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile.\nPlatinized counter electrodes were fabricated using sputtering instruments (TOKUDA, MODEL CFS-4ES-231USC and PMC-5000 Plasma multicoater). For comparison, platinized glass counter electrodes based on a conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2 overlayer, FTO, Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.) and a glass slide were also fabricated. Thermal deposition and electrochemical deposition were also used to coat the Pt film on the metal and plastic substrates. A platinum nanoparticle solution was prepared according to the procedure described in a previous paper .\nThe sheet resistances (R sh) of the substrates and the platinized counter electrodes were measured by the four-dot method (HL5500 PC Hall effect measurement system).\nPorous TiO2 photoelectrodes were fabricated using a screen-printing technique on the FTO glass. The TiO2 paste was prepared from TiO2 powder (P25, Nippon Aerosil; ST-01, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd.) and polyethylene glycol 600, according to the procedure described in our previous paper . The area and thickness of the TiO2 electrode were 0.2 cm2 and ca. 17 \u03bcm. The TiO2 films were immersed in an ethanol solution of cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)-bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719 dye, 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) for 12 h at 25 \u00b0C.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to determine the series resistance of the DSCs. For EIS measurements, a sandwich cell consisting of a TiO2 electrode platinized on an FTO glass sheet and a counter electrode of different substrates, between which a Surlyn film (Dupont, 50 \u03bcm) was inserted as a spacer, was used. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3- propylimidazolium iodine, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in methoxypropionitrile. EIS spectra were obtained at zero bias potential and 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range of 0.05\u2013105 Hz.\nCurrent\u2013voltage curves of the DSCs were obtained by scanning a bias voltage while measuring the photocurrents under white light irradiation (100 mW/cm2) using a sandwich solar cell constructed of the dye-anchored TiO2 electrode and the platinized counter electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp (Ushio Inc., Japan) served as a light source. The photon flux impinging on the cell was determined by a power meter (Nova, Ophir Optronics Ltd.) and a calibration cell (BS-520, s/n 019, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd.). The cells were sealed with Amosil 4 (Solaronix SA) and a 50-\u03bcm thick polymer film was inserted as a spacer (Mitsuidenpo Co., Ltd.) between the two electrodes. For the cell consisting of the ITO-PEN counter electrode, the cell was sealed by the spacer film. The electrolyte solution was introduced through small holes drilled in the counter electrode.\nIt is known that the performance of the solar cell is directly influenced by the sheet resistance (R sh), especially for a large unit cell. We measured the sheet resistances of the substrates and the platinized counter electrodes used in this study, and these results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . It can be seen that no obvious changes in the R sh of the metal sheet and the three types of ITO-PEN films were observed after sputtering a Pt layer. On the other hand, the R sh for the electrically insulating substrates, e.g., glass sheet and polyester film, were drastically reduced to 39 and 61 \u03a9/sq after coating with the 50-nm-thick Pt film. For the metal counter electrodes, the sheet resistance is very low, only 1/10,000 or 1/100,000 of those of FTO glass and ITO-PEN substrate sputtered Pt film, as shown in Table 1. A low sheet resistance of the electrode substrate is a key point in improving the performance of the DSCs. A discussion regarding this point is provided in Section 3.4.\nAn approximately 50 nm thick Pt film was sputtered on the metal sheet under high power (200 mW, 12 min) and a mirror like film was observed. For the plastic substrates, however, cracking or deformation of the substrate occurred under the same conditions. Instead, the Pt film on the plastic substrates was deposited under mild conditions (20 mA, 3 min).\nWe also attempted two other methods, i.e., thermal deposition and electrodeposition. The thermal deposition procedure was as follows: the platinum nanoparticle solution was coated on the metal sheet by a spin coater, and then sintered to the metal sheet at 385 \u00b0C for 15 min. On the contrary, for the ITO-PEN substrates, because the thermal treatment at 250 \u00b0C caused a drastic deformation of the substrates before the solution of nanoparticles was evaporated, the Pt films on the plastic substrates were deposited using a plating process and a sputtering method at room temperature. The thicknesses of the Pt-layers deposited by thermal deposition and plating deposition was controlled at ca. 50 nm.\nThe corrosion stabilities of the metal and plastic substrates in the electrolyte solution were examined. These results are summarized in Table 1. We observed that the Cu and Al foils dissolved in the electrolyte, and the color of the electrolyte changed from brown to colorless. On the other hand, no changes in the color for the stainless steel and Ni sheets were observed. The atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements have verified that the stainless steel and Ni sheet have a good stability in the electrolyte solution for 3 months; the details of this have been described in a previous communication . For the plastic substrates, the polystyrene film dissolved slightly in the electrolyte solution at ambient temperature, whereas no changes for the polyester (OHP) and ITO-PEN film were observed after immersion in the electrolyte solution at 60 \u00b0C and at ambient temperature for 3 months. These results indicated that the polyester (OHP) and ITO-PEN films were stable in the electrolyte solution.\nWe investigated the performances of DSCs based on counter electrodes of various substrates. The characteristics of the DSCs are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 .\nThe primary conversion efficiency for the DSCs based on the stainless steel and Ni electrodes reached only 4.8% and 4.7%, respectively . After optimization of the thickness of the Pt layer coated on the metal substrates and the sputtering power, the conversion efficiencies were improved to 5.3% and 5.1%, respectively. It should be noted that these overall conversion efficiencies were high when using the P25 photoelectrode and could be almost comparable to that based on the FTO glass counter electrode.\nTable 4 shows the performance of DSCs having plastic counter electrodes. The DSC with the ITO-PEN electrode exhibited a relatively higher conversion efficiency (4.2\u20135.4%). On the other hand, the DSCs based on the polyethylene, polystyrene, and OHP electrodes showed relatively low performances. These results were considered to be due to the higher sheet resistance for these counter electrodes than those of the FTO glass and ITO-PEN electrodes, although the sheet resistances were improved using the coated Pt film. Because the series resistance R s of the cell is considered to consist of the sheet resistance of the electrode substrate (R sh), the resistance of the porous TiO2 electrode and the resistance of the electrolyte , R s therefore directly influences the fill factor of the j\u2013V curve; that is a higher series resistance implies a lower fill factor, as was pointed out by the referee.\nIn order to compare the R sh of DSCs with different counter electrode substrates, the R sh values were determined by EIS measurements and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . The equivalent circuit for this type of solar cell was described in the literature . For high frequencies around 100 kHz, the impedance is dominated by the serial resistance (R s). The R s values of DSC with different substrates were 18\u201353 \u03a9 for a 0.20 cm2 active area. The R s values of DSCs with stainless steel, FTO, ITO-PEN, and OHP substrates increase in that order, and the R sh values also increase. For the DSC based on the polyester counter electrode, higher R s and R sh values resulted in a lower fill factor of 49%.\nFurthermore, to compare the relation between the electrode R sh and the performance of the DSC, we chose the three types of ITO-PEN films with different R sh value (16, 27, 62 \u03a9/sq) as the counter electrode substrates. The performance characteristics obtained are shown in Table 4. It was evident that the conversion efficiency decreased with the increase in the electrode R sh; that is, when the R sh of the counter electrode increases by about a factor of 3.9, the fill factor is reduced by ca. 10%, as is the conversion efficiency. Because the j\u2013V characteristics of the DSC can be treated by Eq. (1) as those of a p\u2013n junction solar cell , the relation between the R s and the current density is comprehensible. j=jsc-j0[exp(qV+Rsj/nkT)-1].\nRegarding the performance of DSCs with polystyrene and polyethylene substrates, although the R sh is in the same range as that of the ITO-PEN 150, there was no conductive layer on the substrate. Consequently, the current collection may be affected and result in a lower current density. Also, we estimated that the density of Pt coated on these substrates was not higher than that of the ITO-PEN.\nFurthermore, to elucidate how the size of the cell influences the performances of the DSCs, we compared the conversion efficiencies of DSCs with four different electrode areas of 0.5, 1.0, 2.2, and 4.0 cm2, which were fabricated with both stainless steel and FTO glass counter electrodes. Fig. 1 shows the relation between them. With the increase in the active area of the DSCs, the conversion efficiencies and fill factors of the cells were decreased. However, the rate of decrease for the metal electrode was not faster than that of the FTO glass electrode, and a cross-over point can be seen at 0.6 cm2, as shown in Fig. 1. This means that use of the stainless steel counter electrode improved the fill factor and conversion efficiency of the DSC by reducing the internal resistance of the large size cell. These results indicated that the reduction of the electrode R sh is very important in improving the performance of the larger size solar cell.\nFig. 2 shows the photocurrent\u2013voltage curves of the DSCs based on the stainless steel counter electrodes coated with a Pt layer using three different methods, that is, sputtering, thermal deposition, and electrodeposition. A relatively higher short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor for the DSC based on the sputtered Pt counter electrode were obtained. However, for the DSC based on the counter electrode using thermal deposition, the open voltage (V oc) and the fill factor were lower. For the cell fabricated using the electrodeposited counter electrode, only 5.2 mA of photocurrent was obtained. These results indicate that, although the counter electrodes prepared from the nanoparticle colloid have porous surfaces, i.e, have a relative high catalytic activity, the adhesion of the Pt layer with the substrate was not good. For the electrodeposited counter electrode, the porosity rather than the adhesion was not good. As mentioned in our previous paper, the catalytic activity and the adhesion of the Pt layer are very important for the performance of DSCs , therefore, it is considered that these are some reasons for the reduction of the energy conversion efficiency.\nThe efficiency and stability of the DSCs based on two typical counter electrodes, i.e., the stainless steel sheet and ITO-PEN film, have been studied under continuous illumination by monitoring the j\u2013V characteristics with time. Because we found that the cell fabricated by the P25 photoelectrode and the FTO glass had significant degradation after continuous illumination for 160 h (the details will be reported elsewhere), ST-01 photoelectrodes were used in this study. The stabilities of the DSCs based on the stainless steel and the ITO-PEN counter electrodes were tested over 553 h. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the open circuit voltage (V oc) was almost unchanged; however, a gradual decrease in the photocurrent and the solar energy conversation efficiency of the DSCs was observed. The overall solar energy conversation efficiency for the stainless steel and ITO-PEN were reduced by 52% and 48%, respectively. On the contrary, a reference cell based on the FTO glass was stable within the same time period. The reduction of conversation efficiency for the stainless steel and ITO-PEN cell were attributed to the difficulty of cell sealing and the coating state of the Pt film as the catalyst. Further studies of cell sealing and Pt coating methods on the metal and plastic substrates are necessary.\nWe investigated the properties of DSCs based on several metal and plastic counter electrodes. It was clarified that the stainless steel, Ni, and the ITO-PEN film coated Pt layer had good stabilities in the electrolyte solution. High conversion efficiencies of the DSCs fabricated using the metal substrates and the ITO-PEN film as counter electrodes were obtained, which were almost comparable to that of the FTO glass. In addition, the stainless steel counter electrode showed an important advantage, that is, its excellent electric conductivity, which improved the fill factor and conversion efficiency for the large-size DSC due to the reduced internal resistance of the cell. We believe these novel counter electrodes could be very useful for reducing the manufacturing costs of DSCs, enlarging the size of the DSCs, and developing new style flexible DSCs."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nPhenolic compounds are considered major environmental risks, being present in industrial effluents and as conversion products from natural and synthetic chemicals, including pesticides . Owing to their toxicity, both the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Union (EU) have included some phenols, mainly nitrophenols and chlorophenols, in their lists of priority pollutants. The EU legislation requirement is that the maximum admissible concentration of phenols in drinking water should be 0.5 ng/mL for the total phenols and 0.1 ng/mL for an individual compound . On this basis, the determination of this class of compounds in the environment is of great importance.\nIn an analytical process, it is usually vital to separate the analytes from the matrix, including interfering substances. In fact one of the main objectives of sample preparation is clean-up which is particularly important for complex matrices (e.g. biological samples and in many cases, environmental samples as well). Another aim of sample preparation is enrichment of the analytes to achieve low limits of detection (LODs). There must also be compatibility between the solvent in the final extract and the analytical method.\nLiquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE) is a classical extraction method , which has been, and continues to be, widely used. There are some disadvantages of this method: it is laborious and time consuming. Emulsion formation and precipitation, use of large amount of highly purified (and therefore expensive) solvents along with generation of potentially toxic laboratory waste are the other drawbacks of this method.\nSolid-phase extraction (SPE) is another popular technique. It utilizes a sorbent and consumes lower amounts of solvent. This method has been successfully used for the extraction of chlorophenols from environmental samples . Although there is the potential of automation with SPE, it is expensive. During the last two decades much effort has been focused on developing miniaturized sample preparation techniques to address most of the aforementioned disadvantages of conventional procedures like LLE and SPE.\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a well-established solventless sampling and sample preparation technique. This method has been successfully applied to the analysis of different types of environmental contaminants and pollutants such as chlorophenols . SPME effectively overcomes the difficulties of conventional extraction methods by eliminating the use of organic solvents and allowing sample extraction and preconcentration to be performed in a single step. This technique is predominantly performed on commercially available SPME fibers, which are often prepared by physical or chemical deposition of a polymeric coating on the surface of a fused silica fiber. As commercially available fibers are often fragile, care should be taken during the extraction and desorption processes. In most instances, a rather long extraction time is needed with SPME.\nMiniaturization of liquid extraction approaches has led to the development of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME). The concept of LPME in its original form hinged upon the suspension of an organic solvent microdrop at the tip of a microsyringe needle . This drop-based method is used in both two-phase and three-phase systems , whereby analytes in aqueous samples are extracted, respectively, into a drop of water-immiscible organic solvent, or through a thin layer of organic solvent resting on the top of the sample into an aqueous drop. LPME creates excellent clean-up and uses only a few microliters of solvent. Despite all the benefits of this design, drop-based LPME (more commonly known as single-drop microextraction) is not a very robust system due to the problems related to the instability of the microdrop. This is especially obvious when high stirring rate is involved during the extraction process. Moreover, complex sample matrices have detrimental effects on the stability of the solvent drop. One way to address this issue is to hold the extractant solvent in the wall pores and channel of a hollow fiber membrane that acts as a protective sheath . The analytes are extracted from an aqueous sample, through an organic solvent immobilized in the porous wall of the polypropylene hollow fiber (i.e. supported liquid membrane (SLM)), and into an aqueous acceptor solution in the fiber channel. This procedure is known as liquid\u2013liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (LLLME) or three-phase hollow fiber LPME. The immobilized SLM in the wall pores and organic solvent or solution in the channel of the fiber obviates instability problems in LPME as described above. Furthermore, using the disposable hollow fiber membranes minimizes, if not eliminates, carryover effects.\nElectro membrane extraction (EME) is an extraction technique that was first introduced by Pedersen-Bjergaard and Rasmussen . This method is similar to LLLME except that voltage is applied across the layer of organic solvent in the hollow fiber wall pores, to drive the analytes into the receiving (acceptor) phase in the fiber channel. Published reports have shown that this method of extraction could act as a fast and selective technique for isolating charged analytes from complicated sample matrices. Up to now, most of the reported EME work has been focused on the determination of drugs in biological samples. Following the successful application of EME in environmental studies , in this work, the electrokinetic migration of chlorophenols across a SLM was investigated. Four chlorophenols were selected for this study and different parameters affecting EME of these compounds from seawater samples were optimized via a univariate approach.\n4-Chlorophenol (4CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (24DCP), nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were all obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol (246TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)-grade methanol and acetonitrile were bought from Tedia Company (Fairfield, OH, USA). Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol and hydrochloric acid were bought from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Benzyl alcohol was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhre, Germany) while toluene was from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). Phosphoric acid was purchased from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). Sodium chloride (NaCl) was from Goodrich Chemical Enterprise (Singapore). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was acquired from Chemicon (Temecula, CA, USA). Ultrapure water was prepared on a Nanopure water purification system (Barnstead, Dubuque, IA, USA).\nAll standard solutions of the analytes were prepared in methanol at a concentration of 10,000 \u03bcg/mL. They were diluted with methanol for the EME experiments.\nA Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) HPLC system, including LC-20AD binary pumps, a DGU-20A5 degasser, a dynamic mixing chamber and an SPD-20A ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) detector, was used for separation and determination of the analytes. The separation was performed on a 250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm I.D., 5 \u03bcm, Phenomenax HyperClone C18 column (Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (pH 3). Phosphoric acid was used to adjust the pH of the mobile phase. Direct sample introduction was carried out using a Rheodyne six-port switching valve (Rohnert Park, CA, USA) with a 20 \u03bcL loop. Chromatographic separations were performed using isocratic elution with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for each pump while detection was carried out at a wavelength of 220 nm. The chromatographic data were collected and recorded using LCsolution version 1.22 software from Shimadzu.\nA multi-channel electrophoresis power supply, MCE-PS468, from CE Resources (Singapore) with programmable voltage was used as a direct current (d.c.) source.\nThe EME set-up used for electromigration of analytes across the SLM is shown in Fig. 1 . Two platinum wires (0.1 mm diameter) were used as electrodes and inserted in the donor (negative electrode) and acceptor (positive electrode) solutions.\nThe membrane bag was made from Accurel 2E HF (R/P) polypropylene hollow fiber membrane sheet (157 \u03bcm thickness \u00d7 0.2 \u03bcm pore size) supplied by Membrana (Wuppertal, Germany). The membrane bag was prepared in definite dimensions (for example, 1.4 cm \u00d7 2.2 cm (width \u00d7 height), with an opening along the shorter dimension).\nTo seal the open ends, a plastic bag heat-sealing device was used. The acceptor solution was introduced to the bag through the single open end. The latter was then immersed in an organic solvent (for ca. 5 s) in order to fill the wall pores, forming the SLM. The pK a values of 4CP, 24DCP, 246TCP and PCP are 8.81, 7.81, 6.30 and 5.55, respectively. According to the basic principles of EME and the given pK a values, a 3 mL donor solution, adjusted to pH 12 and spiked with 5 \u03bcg/mL of each chlorophenol, was first considered for the EME experiments. 100 \u03bcL NaOH solution at pH 12 was used as the acceptor solution. Other initial conditions included an extraction time of 5 min, voltage of 50 V and stirring rate of 700 rpm.\nTo investigate the extraction efficiency and enrichment, various parameters surmised to be influential to extraction, including the type of SLM, acceptor and donor phase pH, sample and acceptor volume, stirring rate, applied voltage, extraction time, and salt addition were optimized via a univariate approach. The enrichment factor (EF) was calculated according to the following equation: EF=Ca,finalCa,initial where C a,final is the final concentration of analyte in the acceptor phase, and C a,initial is the initial analyte concentration within the sample.\nThere are specific requirements for a solvent to be used as an SLM in EME. The distribution tendency of the analytes into the SLM should be higher than that in aquatic media to allow mass transfer of the analytes into acceptor phase via the SLM. The extraction procedure could also be tuned to achieve enhancement of the selectivity and good clean-up by utilizing different solvents in combination with various modifiers or coextractants. Furthermore, the solvent should be immiscible in water to avoid losses from the hollow fiber membrane wall pores and dissolution in the sample during stirring. These criteria are similar to those used in LLE or LPME, except that in the present case, the analytes are ionic. Particularly in EME, the sample solution, SLM and acceptor phase should complete an electrical circuit. Thus the solvent should have sufficient electrical conductivity, so as to allow electrokinetic migration of compounds across the SLM into the acceptor phase and to prevent an increase in the current flow in the system.\nConsidering all these criteria, alcohols like 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, benzyl alcohol along with MEK, NPOE and toluene were evaluated . Toluene and NPOE were found to be unsuitable for EME of chlorophenols as the recoveries obtained were very low. In addition the recovery results obtained with toluene were inconsistent. This could be due to its relatively moderate volatility and low density. All the rest of the solvents were observed to give very similar performance, except that 1-octanol showed a special selectivity for the extraction of PCP. This could be attributed to the compatibility of 1-octanol with the more hydrophobic PCP, with respect to its polarity. This is similar to the case in LLE, where the solvent is the main determinative factor affecting selectivity. While 1-octanol was found to be a suitable and more selective solvent for the EME of PCP, it did not, however, fare as well for 24DCP; the extraction for this compound was very low.\nIt has been found that addition of hydrophobic ion-pair reagents to SLM would enable better phase transfer and electrokinetic migration of analytes . This is because ion-pair reagents enhance the solubility of the protonated analytes, which aids in the permeation of the analytes at the interface between the sample and SLM. To investigate this effect, 3% CTAB in 1-octanol was used as the SLM. For 4CP, 24DCP and 246TCP, there was slight improvement in recovery. For PCP, being a more hydrophobic compound, a decrease in recovery was observed. The strong interaction of the ion-pair PCP complex with the organic phase may be responsible for this behavior. It was obvious that use of an ion-pair reagent in this work gives variable results, and thus does not provide any general guidance on the trends of extraction for all the analytes considered.\nIn order to perform this study, vials with 2 and 1.5 cm I.D. were used for EME lasting 5 min. To avoid complications, our studies focused on the comparison between vials of similar I.D. but containing different sample volumes. Hence comparisons were performed between the sample volumes of 23 and 10 mL, using vials of 2 cm I.D. and between sample volumes of 2 and 3 mL, using vials with 1.5 cm I.D. Experiments with sample volume of 10 mL showed slightly better percentage recovery of analytes than those with volumes of 23 mL. There was no significant difference in recovery between sample volumes of 2 and 3 mL. However, the decrease in the sample volume from 10 mL (2 cm I.D. vial) to 3 mL (1.5 cm I.D. vial) caused a significant increase in recovery. This could be related to the shortened migration distance of analytes towards the membrane. The improvement in recovery was most prominent for PCP, which possesses the highest molecular weight among the analytes. Since migration velocity depends on the charge to size ratio, this decline in migration distance will have a more obvious effect on PCP.\nTo continue our study based on sample volume of 1 mL, a vial with 0.9 cm I.D. was employed and the width of the membrane bag was changed from 1.4 to 0.6 cm. By lowering the sample volume to 1 mL, there was an insignificant decrease in recovery for 4CP and 24DCP, while for 246TCP, there was a slight increase in recovery. For PCP, an almost two-fold enhancement was observed. Mass transfer in this system is accomplished by electrokinetic migration and convection. Since the electric field strength is stronger and convection is also more effective in a much smaller sample compartment, an increase in recovery for all compounds was expected. However, our observation was that stronger electrical field mainly affected compounds with lower mobilities (i.e. 246TCP and PCP). The slight decrease in recovery for 4CP and 24DCP could have resulted from factors associated with this observation which somewhat suppressed the transfer of these analytes.\nFinally an amount of 1 mL of sample was used for further experiments.\nFor the following step of optimization, the pH of both donor and acceptor phases were considered. For this purpose, different amounts of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were employed to prepare donor solutions with different pH values (2, 4, 10, 12). Deionized water at pH 7.2 was used as well. The results are shown in Fig. 2a. Increasing degree of ionization of the phenols (reflecting the increase in pH of the donor solutions) led to improvement in electrokinetic migration. The completely ionized forms of analytes could be achieved when the pH value exceeded the pK a values of the target compounds. As such, the best extraction results were achieved at pH 12, as indicated by Fig. 2a.\nCorresponding experiments were performed to investigate the effect of pH in the acceptor solution. The results are summarized in Fig. 2b.\nThe electrolytic reactions taking place in the donor and acceptor solutions include the following:\nDonor solution (negative electrode): 2H+ + 2e\u2212 \u2192 H2\nAcceptor solution (positive electrode): H2O \u2192 2H+ + 1/2O2 + 2e\u2212\nThese reactions demonstrate the dependency of extraction recovery on the pH of the acceptor phase as well. The selected pH should be sufficiently high to maintain analytes in the ionized forms and prevent them from being re-extracted into the organic phase.\nSince electrolysis of water at the anode in the acceptor phase leads to the formation of hydronium ions, a gradual decrease of pH during extraction could occur . Thus, a pH of 12 was considered to be most suitable.\nFrom previous experiments, it was found that 100 \u03bcL of 0.01 M NaOH acceptor solution might not be the most suitable volume. Firstly, occasional and inadvertent leakage of the acceptor solution from the membrane bag would occur. Secondly, usage of lesser amount of this phase should be favorable to prevent the dilution of analytes. As such, smaller volumes of the acceptor phase (20, 35, 50, 70 and 100 \u03bcL) with NaOH concentration maintained at 0.01 M were used to investigate the optimal acceptor phase volume. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 . With decreasing amount of acceptor solution used, the enrichment of PCP became more prominent. For other analytes, there was only negligible or slight improvement in their enrichments.\nMore effective enrichment was expected with further lowering of the acceptor phase volume; however, it was not experimentally favorable to work with volumes lower than 20 \u03bcL. This is due to this fact that the electrodes could not be placed in proper contact with the minute amount of acceptor solution, and the amount was also too little to be collected reliably at the end of the extractions. Therefore, it was decided to use 20 \u03bcL as the acceptor solution volume for practical reasons.\nStirring is essential in most diffusion-based microextraction techniques to ensure proper mixing of the sample so that the thickness of the boundary layer at the interface between the sample solution and the SLM is reduced. The importance of stirring rate in EME had also been highlighted in recent papers . It was observed that analyte recovery could be increased with increasing stirring rate. Our investigations gave similar results. At the maximum stirring rate, i.e. 1250 rpm, highest recovery was obtained. Thus, a stirring rate of 1250 rpm was chosen for the rest of the experiments.\nThe main mass transfer mechanism in EME is the electrokinetic migration of the analytes across the SLM into the acceptor solution, and this is greatly dependent on the applied voltage. In a recent paper, Kjelsen et al. described how the flux of analytes was driven by the electric potential applied across a SLM . A series of experiments with extraction voltages ranging from 0 to 200 V were conducted. In a totally quiescent assembly (0 V), the target analytes were not extracted at all (with stirring), but with the application of merely 10 V, significant amounts of analytes were recovered, particularly for PCP. A recent report on using voltage to extract nerve agent degradation products across a membrane also showed that without application of voltage, no extraction took place . The prominent effect of voltage confirmed that the potential difference between the electrodes was the main driving force in EME. However, the recoveries decreased when higher voltages were supplied. It is worth mentioning that applying voltage could lead to lower pH in acceptor solution due to the formation of hydronium ions. Therefore with a decrease in the acceptor phase pH, the distribution of analytes into the organic SLM could increase, accounting for the decline in recoveries when >10 V was applied . Our results (Fig. 4 ) showed that a low voltage of 10 V was sufficient to extract PCP. This presents a possibility to utilize a common dry cell battery for the selective EME of PCP, providing another advantage of this approach specific to the determination of this particular chlorophenol.\nPreliminary experiments with extraction time of 5 min showed effective extraction of the analytes. In order to investigate the electrokinetic migration of these chlorophenols over time, the extraction time was varied from 1 to 30 min. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 , the amount of PCP extracted increased from 1 to 10 min but a clear reduction in the signal intensity could be observed after 10 min. A similar result was obtained for 246TCP, while for 4CP and 24DCP, a decline was observed after 5 min. Such a phenomenon was most probably due to the back extraction of analytes into the organic SLM, which was probably triggered by the decrease in pH of the acceptor solution after these times. The extraction was, therefore, performed in 10 min.\nAddition of NaCl in the range of 0\u201330% was investigated. As the percentage of salt was increased, the recovery of analytes was reduced. This could be related to the migration of chloride, as a major competitor, along with the ionic species. According to a previous study , the presence of high content of ionic substances causes an increase in the value of the ion balance (\u03c7) in the system, which in turn decreases the flux of analytes across the SLM. Our observations are in full agreement with the study. Thus, migration of the analytes would be more efficient in the absence of salt.\nTo generate comparable data, three-phase LPME extraction was carried out with the same apparatus and extraction conditions, except for the use of electrodes and power supply. The composition of the sample solution was also different. In EME, the sample solution was made alkaline to ensure that ionization of the acidic analytes could occur easily; this was necessary to promote electrokinetic migration in the system. For LPME, the sample solution was prepared in 0.01 M HCl to maintain the neutrality of the analytes and promote their distribution into the organic SLM. To perform LPME, briefly an amount of 1 mL of sample solution, already adjusted to pH 2, was first filled into a 1.5 mL vial and spiked with the analytes of interest at a concentration level of 5 \u03bcg/mL. A 20 \u03bcL volume of a solution with pH 12 was placed into the membrane bag as the acceptor phase (the same as for EME). The bag was then immersed in 1-octanol for some seconds, to fill the pores of the membrane wall. It was then dabbed gently with lint-free tissue paper to remove excess 1-octanol. Subsequently, the bag was suspended in the sample solution. During extraction, the sample solution was agitated at 1250 rpm with a magnetic stirrer. After 10 min, the acceptor solution was collected in a 100 \u03bcL micro-vial and 10 \u03bcL of the extractant was injected into the HPLC-UV system.\nAlthough the experiments were similar in terms of the apparatus required, the extraction principle is different; in LPME, mass transfer is based on passive diffusion instead of electrokinetic migration that is found in EME .\nThe chromatograms in Fig. 6 suggest that the developed EME procedure is capable of extracting and enriching PCP specifically; for the other chlorophenols, however, LPME provided better extraction. PCP was not as effectively extracted using LPME but, interestingly, its extraction was drastically improved with EME. This result demonstrates that electrical potential may be much more efficient than pH gradients in driving extractions of large charged hydrophobic compounds across an SLM. The finding shows that EME may be more attractive for the selective isolation of higher molecular mass and more hydrophobic compounds.\nConsidering the optimized EME parameters, quantitative analysis was evaluated only for the determination of PCP in spiked distilled water samples. An enrichment factor of 23 along with an acceptable sample clean-up was obtained. As Table 1 summarizes, a linear range of 0.5\u20131000 ng/mL (y = 1904x + 7653) and an excellent r 2 (coefficient of estimation) value of 0.999 were obtained. Furthermore, the precision of the method was determined by performing six consecutive extractions from an aqueous solution. The standard deviation of the peak areas of PCP at a concentration level of 0.5 ng/mL was found to be 6.8%. Limits of detection and quantification, based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, were found to be 0.1 and 0.4 ng/mL, respectively.\nTable 1 also illustrates some analytical data obtained from other LPME-based methods and one recent SPME method used for the determination of PCP. Comparison of EME data with those obtained from these techniques demonstrates that electrokinetic migration provides a very efficient mechanism. This methodology not only provides sufficient and acceptable sensitivity in a short time scale, but it could also be used with a small amount of sample without any derivatization needed.\nTo evaluate the applicability of the proposed method for PCP extraction, experiments were performed on seawater samples collected from a coastal location. The seawater sample was first extracted using the developed method. Since no PCP was found in this sample, the latter was spiked with this analyte at a concentration level of 1 ng/mL, and analysis was carried out as before. The chromatograms of extracts from unspiked and spiked seawater samples are shown in Fig. 7 . It is worth mentioning that the HPLC conditions were altered to shorten the run time since only one analyte was considered. Although there were impurity peaks due to organic substances present in the seawater, a relative recovery of 74% was achieved for PCP at a spiked level of 1 ng/mL, demonstrating the feasibility of using EME-HPLC for selective PCP determination in genuine environmental aqueous matrices.\nOur investigation on the EME of chlorophenols revealed that the comparatively higher molecular weight and more hydrophobic compounds are more amenable to be isolated via this electrokinetic-based technique. Direct comparison of these results with those obtained by other microextraction approaches shows that the proposed technique exhibits particular selectivity towards PCP, which is the most non-polar compound amongst the chlorophenols considered. Comparing with the corresponding three-phase LPME method, the enrichment of PCP was found to be four times greater with merely 10 min of extraction time. The optimized voltage for extraction was only 10 V, which allows the use of a common dry cell battery for potential field applications. The linearity, reproducibility and detection limits obtained using this method are comparable to those achieved by other techniques.\nAlthough more research is required for better understanding of the electrokinetic extraction of these analytes across a SLM, the developed technique has definitely presented several advantages like simplicity, short analysis time, low cost, ease of operation, low consumption of solvent and no requirement of derivatization. Lastly, the feasibility of the method to extract PCP selectively was demonstrated successfully for a spiked genuine seawater sample.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Phenolic compounds are considered major environmental risks, being present in industrial effluents and as conversion products from natural and synthetic chemicals, including pesticides . Owing to their toxicity, both the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Union (EU) have included some phenols, mainly nitrophenols and chlorophenols, in their lists of priority pollutants. The EU legislation requirement is that the maximum admissible concentration of phenols in drinking water should be 0.5 ng/mL for the total phenols and 0.1 ng/mL for an individual compound . On this basis, the determination of this class of compounds in the environment is of great importance.\nIn an analytical process, it is usually vital to separate the analytes from the matrix, including interfering substances. In fact one of the main objectives of sample preparation is clean-up which is particularly important for complex matrices (e.g. biological samples and in many cases, environmental samples as well). Another aim of sample preparation is enrichment of the analytes to achieve low limits of detection (LODs). There must also be compatibility between the solvent in the final extract and the analytical method.\nLiquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE) is a classical extraction method , which has been, and continues to be, widely used. There are some disadvantages of this method: it is laborious and time consuming. Emulsion formation and precipitation, use of large amount of highly purified (and therefore expensive) solvents along with generation of potentially toxic laboratory waste are the other drawbacks of this method.\nSolid-phase extraction (SPE) is another popular technique. It utilizes a sorbent and consumes lower amounts of solvent. This method has been successfully used for the extraction of chlorophenols from environmental samples . Although there is the potential of automation with SPE, it is expensive. During the last two decades much effort has been focused on developing miniaturized sample preparation techniques to address most of the aforementioned disadvantages of conventional procedures like LLE and SPE.\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a well-established solventless sampling and sample preparation technique. This method has been successfully applied to the analysis of different types of environmental contaminants and pollutants such as chlorophenols . SPME effectively overcomes the difficulties of conventional extraction methods by eliminating the use of organic solvents and allowing sample extraction and preconcentration to be performed in a single step. This technique is predominantly performed on commercially available SPME fibers, which are often prepared by physical or chemical deposition of a polymeric coating on the surface of a fused silica fiber. As commercially available fibers are often fragile, care should be taken during the extraction and desorption processes. In most instances, a rather long extraction time is needed with SPME.\nMiniaturization of liquid extraction approaches has led to the development of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME). The concept of LPME in its original form hinged upon the suspension of an organic solvent microdrop at the tip of a microsyringe needle . This drop-based method is used in both two-phase and three-phase systems , whereby analytes in aqueous samples are extracted, respectively, into a drop of water-immiscible organic solvent, or through a thin layer of organic solvent resting on the top of the sample into an aqueous drop. LPME creates excellent clean-up and uses only a few microliters of solvent. Despite all the benefits of this design, drop-based LPME (more commonly known as single-drop microextraction) is not a very robust system due to the problems related to the instability of the microdrop. This is especially obvious when high stirring rate is involved during the extraction process. Moreover, complex sample matrices have detrimental effects on the stability of the solvent drop. One way to address this issue is to hold the extractant solvent in the wall pores and channel of a hollow fiber membrane that acts as a protective sheath . The analytes are extracted from an aqueous sample, through an organic solvent immobilized in the porous wall of the polypropylene hollow fiber (i.e. supported liquid membrane (SLM)), and into an aqueous acceptor solution in the fiber channel. This procedure is known as liquid\u2013liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (LLLME) or three-phase hollow fiber LPME. The immobilized SLM in the wall pores and organic solvent or solution in the channel of the fiber obviates instability problems in LPME as described above. Furthermore, using the disposable hollow fiber membranes minimizes, if not eliminates, carryover effects.\nElectro membrane extraction (EME) is an extraction technique that was first introduced by Pedersen-Bjergaard and Rasmussen . This method is similar to LLLME except that voltage is applied across the layer of organic solvent in the hollow fiber wall pores, to drive the analytes into the receiving (acceptor) phase in the fiber channel. Published reports have shown that this method of extraction could act as a fast and selective technique for isolating charged analytes from complicated sample matrices. Up to now, most of the reported EME work has been focused on the determination of drugs in biological samples. Following the successful application of EME in environmental studies , in this work, the electrokinetic migration of chlorophenols across a SLM was investigated. Four chlorophenols were selected for this study and different parameters affecting EME of these compounds from seawater samples were optimized via a univariate approach.\n4-Chlorophenol (4CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (24DCP), nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were all obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol (246TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)-grade methanol and acetonitrile were bought from Tedia Company (Fairfield, OH, USA). Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol and hydrochloric acid were bought from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Benzyl alcohol was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhre, Germany) while toluene was from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). Phosphoric acid was purchased from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). Sodium chloride (NaCl) was from Goodrich Chemical Enterprise (Singapore). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was acquired from Chemicon (Temecula, CA, USA). Ultrapure water was prepared on a Nanopure water purification system (Barnstead, Dubuque, IA, USA).\nAll standard solutions of the analytes were prepared in methanol at a concentration of 10,000 \u03bcg/mL. They were diluted with methanol for the EME experiments.\nA Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) HPLC system, including LC-20AD binary pumps, a DGU-20A5 degasser, a dynamic mixing chamber and an SPD-20A ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) detector, was used for separation and determination of the analytes. The separation was performed on a 250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm I.D., 5 \u03bcm, Phenomenax HyperClone C18 column (Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (pH 3). Phosphoric acid was used to adjust the pH of the mobile phase. Direct sample introduction was carried out using a Rheodyne six-port switching valve (Rohnert Park, CA, USA) with a 20 \u03bcL loop. Chromatographic separations were performed using isocratic elution with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for each pump while detection was carried out at a wavelength of 220 nm. The chromatographic data were collected and recorded using LCsolution version 1.22 software from Shimadzu.\nA multi-channel electrophoresis power supply, MCE-PS468, from CE Resources (Singapore) with programmable voltage was used as a direct current (d.c.) source.\nThe EME set-up used for electromigration of analytes across the SLM is shown in Fig. 1 . Two platinum wires (0.1 mm diameter) were used as electrodes and inserted in the donor (negative electrode) and acceptor (positive electrode) solutions.\nThe membrane bag was made from Accurel 2E HF (R/P) polypropylene hollow fiber membrane sheet (157 \u03bcm thickness \u00d7 0.2 \u03bcm pore size) supplied by Membrana (Wuppertal, Germany). The membrane bag was prepared in definite dimensions (for example, 1.4 cm \u00d7 2.2 cm (width \u00d7 height), with an opening along the shorter dimension).\nTo seal the open ends, a plastic bag heat-sealing device was used. The acceptor solution was introduced to the bag through the single open end. The latter was then immersed in an organic solvent (for ca. 5 s) in order to fill the wall pores, forming the SLM. The pK a values of 4CP, 24DCP, 246TCP and PCP are 8.81, 7.81, 6.30 and 5.55, respectively. According to the basic principles of EME and the given pK a values, a 3 mL donor solution, adjusted to pH 12 and spiked with 5 \u03bcg/mL of each chlorophenol, was first considered for the EME experiments. 100 \u03bcL NaOH solution at pH 12 was used as the acceptor solution. Other initial conditions included an extraction time of 5 min, voltage of 50 V and stirring rate of 700 rpm.\nTo investigate the extraction efficiency and enrichment, various parameters surmised to be influential to extraction, including the type of SLM, acceptor and donor phase pH, sample and acceptor volume, stirring rate, applied voltage, extraction time, and salt addition were optimized via a univariate approach. The enrichment factor (EF) was calculated according to the following equation: EF=Ca,finalCa,initial where C a,final is the final concentration of analyte in the acceptor phase, and C a,initial is the initial analyte concentration within the sample.\nThere are specific requirements for a solvent to be used as an SLM in EME. The distribution tendency of the analytes into the SLM should be higher than that in aquatic media to allow mass transfer of the analytes into acceptor phase via the SLM. The extraction procedure could also be tuned to achieve enhancement of the selectivity and good clean-up by utilizing different solvents in combination with various modifiers or coextractants. Furthermore, the solvent should be immiscible in water to avoid losses from the hollow fiber membrane wall pores and dissolution in the sample during stirring. These criteria are similar to those used in LLE or LPME, except that in the present case, the analytes are ionic. Particularly in EME, the sample solution, SLM and acceptor phase should complete an electrical circuit. Thus the solvent should have sufficient electrical conductivity, so as to allow electrokinetic migration of compounds across the SLM into the acceptor phase and to prevent an increase in the current flow in the system.\nConsidering all these criteria, alcohols like 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, benzyl alcohol along with MEK, NPOE and toluene were evaluated . Toluene and NPOE were found to be unsuitable for EME of chlorophenols as the recoveries obtained were very low. In addition the recovery results obtained with toluene were inconsistent. This could be due to its relatively moderate volatility and low density. All the rest of the solvents were observed to give very similar performance, except that 1-octanol showed a special selectivity for the extraction of PCP. This could be attributed to the compatibility of 1-octanol with the more hydrophobic PCP, with respect to its polarity. This is similar to the case in LLE, where the solvent is the main determinative factor affecting selectivity. While 1-octanol was found to be a suitable and more selective solvent for the EME of PCP, it did not, however, fare as well for 24DCP; the extraction for this compound was very low.\nIt has been found that addition of hydrophobic ion-pair reagents to SLM would enable better phase transfer and electrokinetic migration of analytes . This is because ion-pair reagents enhance the solubility of the protonated analytes, which aids in the permeation of the analytes at the interface between the sample and SLM. To investigate this effect, 3% CTAB in 1-octanol was used as the SLM. For 4CP, 24DCP and 246TCP, there was slight improvement in recovery. For PCP, being a more hydrophobic compound, a decrease in recovery was observed. The strong interaction of the ion-pair PCP complex with the organic phase may be responsible for this behavior. It was obvious that use of an ion-pair reagent in this work gives variable results, and thus does not provide any general guidance on the trends of extraction for all the analytes considered.\nIn order to perform this study, vials with 2 and 1.5 cm I.D. were used for EME lasting 5 min. To avoid complications, our studies focused on the comparison between vials of similar I.D. but containing different sample volumes. Hence comparisons were performed between the sample volumes of 23 and 10 mL, using vials of 2 cm I.D. and between sample volumes of 2 and 3 mL, using vials with 1.5 cm I.D. Experiments with sample volume of 10 mL showed slightly better percentage recovery of analytes than those with volumes of 23 mL. There was no significant difference in recovery between sample volumes of 2 and 3 mL. However, the decrease in the sample volume from 10 mL (2 cm I.D. vial) to 3 mL (1.5 cm I.D. vial) caused a significant increase in recovery. This could be related to the shortened migration distance of analytes towards the membrane. The improvement in recovery was most prominent for PCP, which possesses the highest molecular weight among the analytes. Since migration velocity depends on the charge to size ratio, this decline in migration distance will have a more obvious effect on PCP.\nTo continue our study based on sample volume of 1 mL, a vial with 0.9 cm I.D. was employed and the width of the membrane bag was changed from 1.4 to 0.6 cm. By lowering the sample volume to 1 mL, there was an insignificant decrease in recovery for 4CP and 24DCP, while for 246TCP, there was a slight increase in recovery. For PCP, an almost two-fold enhancement was observed. Mass transfer in this system is accomplished by electrokinetic migration and convection. Since the electric field strength is stronger and convection is also more effective in a much smaller sample compartment, an increase in recovery for all compounds was expected. However, our observation was that stronger electrical field mainly affected compounds with lower mobilities (i.e. 246TCP and PCP). The slight decrease in recovery for 4CP and 24DCP could have resulted from factors associated with this observation which somewhat suppressed the transfer of these analytes.\nFinally an amount of 1 mL of sample was used for further experiments.\nFor the following step of optimization, the pH of both donor and acceptor phases were considered. For this purpose, different amounts of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were employed to prepare donor solutions with different pH values (2, 4, 10, 12). Deionized water at pH 7.2 was used as well. The results are shown in Fig. 2a. Increasing degree of ionization of the phenols (reflecting the increase in pH of the donor solutions) led to improvement in electrokinetic migration. The completely ionized forms of analytes could be achieved when the pH value exceeded the pK a values of the target compounds. As such, the best extraction results were achieved at pH 12, as indicated by Fig. 2a.\nCorresponding experiments were performed to investigate the effect of pH in the acceptor solution. The results are summarized in Fig. 2b.\nThe electrolytic reactions taking place in the donor and acceptor solutions include the following:\nDonor solution (negative electrode): 2H+ + 2e\u2212 \u2192 H2\nAcceptor solution (positive electrode): H2O \u2192 2H+ + 1/2O2 + 2e\u2212\nThese reactions demonstrate the dependency of extraction recovery on the pH of the acceptor phase as well. The selected pH should be sufficiently high to maintain analytes in the ionized forms and prevent them from being re-extracted into the organic phase.\nSince electrolysis of water at the anode in the acceptor phase leads to the formation of hydronium ions, a gradual decrease of pH during extraction could occur . Thus, a pH of 12 was considered to be most suitable.\nFrom previous experiments, it was found that 100 \u03bcL of 0.01 M NaOH acceptor solution might not be the most suitable volume. Firstly, occasional and inadvertent leakage of the acceptor solution from the membrane bag would occur. Secondly, usage of lesser amount of this phase should be favorable to prevent the dilution of analytes. As such, smaller volumes of the acceptor phase (20, 35, 50, 70 and 100 \u03bcL) with NaOH concentration maintained at 0.01 M were used to investigate the optimal acceptor phase volume. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 . With decreasing amount of acceptor solution used, the enrichment of PCP became more prominent. For other analytes, there was only negligible or slight improvement in their enrichments.\nMore effective enrichment was expected with further lowering of the acceptor phase volume; however, it was not experimentally favorable to work with volumes lower than 20 \u03bcL. This is due to this fact that the electrodes could not be placed in proper contact with the minute amount of acceptor solution, and the amount was also too little to be collected reliably at the end of the extractions. Therefore, it was decided to use 20 \u03bcL as the acceptor solution volume for practical reasons.\nStirring is essential in most diffusion-based microextraction techniques to ensure proper mixing of the sample so that the thickness of the boundary layer at the interface between the sample solution and the SLM is reduced. The importance of stirring rate in EME had also been highlighted in recent papers . It was observed that analyte recovery could be increased with increasing stirring rate. Our investigations gave similar results. At the maximum stirring rate, i.e. 1250 rpm, highest recovery was obtained. Thus, a stirring rate of 1250 rpm was chosen for the rest of the experiments.\nThe main mass transfer mechanism in EME is the electrokinetic migration of the analytes across the SLM into the acceptor solution, and this is greatly dependent on the applied voltage. In a recent paper, Kjelsen et al. described how the flux of analytes was driven by the electric potential applied across a SLM . A series of experiments with extraction voltages ranging from 0 to 200 V were conducted. In a totally quiescent assembly (0 V), the target analytes were not extracted at all (with stirring), but with the application of merely 10 V, significant amounts of analytes were recovered, particularly for PCP. A recent report on using voltage to extract nerve agent degradation products across a membrane also showed that without application of voltage, no extraction took place . The prominent effect of voltage confirmed that the potential difference between the electrodes was the main driving force in EME. However, the recoveries decreased when higher voltages were supplied. It is worth mentioning that applying voltage could lead to lower pH in acceptor solution due to the formation of hydronium ions. Therefore with a decrease in the acceptor phase pH, the distribution of analytes into the organic SLM could increase, accounting for the decline in recoveries when >10 V was applied . Our results (Fig. 4 ) showed that a low voltage of 10 V was sufficient to extract PCP. This presents a possibility to utilize a common dry cell battery for the selective EME of PCP, providing another advantage of this approach specific to the determination of this particular chlorophenol.\nPreliminary experiments with extraction time of 5 min showed effective extraction of the analytes. In order to investigate the electrokinetic migration of these chlorophenols over time, the extraction time was varied from 1 to 30 min. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 , the amount of PCP extracted increased from 1 to 10 min but a clear reduction in the signal intensity could be observed after 10 min. A similar result was obtained for 246TCP, while for 4CP and 24DCP, a decline was observed after 5 min. Such a phenomenon was most probably due to the back extraction of analytes into the organic SLM, which was probably triggered by the decrease in pH of the acceptor solution after these times. The extraction was, therefore, performed in 10 min.\nAddition of NaCl in the range of 0\u201330% was investigated. As the percentage of salt was increased, the recovery of analytes was reduced. This could be related to the migration of chloride, as a major competitor, along with the ionic species. According to a previous study , the presence of high content of ionic substances causes an increase in the value of the ion balance (\u03c7) in the system, which in turn decreases the flux of analytes across the SLM. Our observations are in full agreement with the study. Thus, migration of the analytes would be more efficient in the absence of salt.\nTo generate comparable data, three-phase LPME extraction was carried out with the same apparatus and extraction conditions, except for the use of electrodes and power supply. The composition of the sample solution was also different. In EME, the sample solution was made alkaline to ensure that ionization of the acidic analytes could occur easily; this was necessary to promote electrokinetic migration in the system. For LPME, the sample solution was prepared in 0.01 M HCl to maintain the neutrality of the analytes and promote their distribution into the organic SLM. To perform LPME, briefly an amount of 1 mL of sample solution, already adjusted to pH 2, was first filled into a 1.5 mL vial and spiked with the analytes of interest at a concentration level of 5 \u03bcg/mL. A 20 \u03bcL volume of a solution with pH 12 was placed into the membrane bag as the acceptor phase (the same as for EME). The bag was then immersed in 1-octanol for some seconds, to fill the pores of the membrane wall. It was then dabbed gently with lint-free tissue paper to remove excess 1-octanol. Subsequently, the bag was suspended in the sample solution. During extraction, the sample solution was agitated at 1250 rpm with a magnetic stirrer. After 10 min, the acceptor solution was collected in a 100 \u03bcL micro-vial and 10 \u03bcL of the extractant was injected into the HPLC-UV system.\nAlthough the experiments were similar in terms of the apparatus required, the extraction principle is different; in LPME, mass transfer is based on passive diffusion instead of electrokinetic migration that is found in EME .\nThe chromatograms in Fig. 6 suggest that the developed EME procedure is capable of extracting and enriching PCP specifically; for the other chlorophenols, however, LPME provided better extraction. PCP was not as effectively extracted using LPME but, interestingly, its extraction was drastically improved with EME. This result demonstrates that electrical potential may be much more efficient than pH gradients in driving extractions of large charged hydrophobic compounds across an SLM. The finding shows that EME may be more attractive for the selective isolation of higher molecular mass and more hydrophobic compounds.\nConsidering the optimized EME parameters, quantitative analysis was evaluated only for the determination of PCP in spiked distilled water samples. An enrichment factor of 23 along with an acceptable sample clean-up was obtained. As Table 1 summarizes, a linear range of 0.5\u20131000 ng/mL (y = 1904x + 7653) and an excellent r 2 (coefficient of estimation) value of 0.999 were obtained. Furthermore, the precision of the method was determined by performing six consecutive extractions from an aqueous solution. The standard deviation of the peak areas of PCP at a concentration level of 0.5 ng/mL was found to be 6.8%. Limits of detection and quantification, based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, were found to be 0.1 and 0.4 ng/mL, respectively.\nTable 1 also illustrates some analytical data obtained from other LPME-based methods and one recent SPME method used for the determination of PCP. Comparison of EME data with those obtained from these techniques demonstrates that electrokinetic migration provides a very efficient mechanism. This methodology not only provides sufficient and acceptable sensitivity in a short time scale, but it could also be used with a small amount of sample without any derivatization needed.\nTo evaluate the applicability of the proposed method for PCP extraction, experiments were performed on seawater samples collected from a coastal location. The seawater sample was first extracted using the developed method. Since no PCP was found in this sample, the latter was spiked with this analyte at a concentration level of 1 ng/mL, and analysis was carried out as before. The chromatograms of extracts from unspiked and spiked seawater samples are shown in Fig. 7 . It is worth mentioning that the HPLC conditions were altered to shorten the run time since only one analyte was considered. Although there were impurity peaks due to organic substances present in the seawater, a relative recovery of 74% was achieved for PCP at a spiked level of 1 ng/mL, demonstrating the feasibility of using EME-HPLC for selective PCP determination in genuine environmental aqueous matrices.\nOur investigation on the EME of chlorophenols revealed that the comparatively higher molecular weight and more hydrophobic compounds are more amenable to be isolated via this electrokinetic-based technique. Direct comparison of these results with those obtained by other microextraction approaches shows that the proposed technique exhibits particular selectivity towards PCP, which is the most non-polar compound amongst the chlorophenols considered. Comparing with the corresponding three-phase LPME method, the enrichment of PCP was found to be four times greater with merely 10 min of extraction time. The optimized voltage for extraction was only 10 V, which allows the use of a common dry cell battery for potential field applications. The linearity, reproducibility and detection limits obtained using this method are comparable to those achieved by other techniques.\nAlthough more research is required for better understanding of the electrokinetic extraction of these analytes across a SLM, the developed technique has definitely presented several advantages like simplicity, short analysis time, low cost, ease of operation, low consumption of solvent and no requirement of derivatization. Lastly, the feasibility of the method to extract PCP selectively was demonstrated successfully for a spiked genuine seawater sample."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe determination of copper species is of special concern in both environmental and process monitoring. Copper is an essential element at trace level (i.e. catalytic action in heme synthesis) , but the intake of large quantities can be toxic. Sources of copper poisoning include beverages from vending machines, copper or brass vessels, and sometimes water supplies. Monitoring Cu(II) concentration is also becoming important in microelectronics fabrication industry. Thus, the development of simple, reliable, and low-cost techniques for copper determination is essential.\nSeveral electrochemical methods have been worked out for the determination of copper(II), most of them employing anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) in which preconcentration proceeded by either electrodeposition on mercury electrode or chemical accumulation at chemically modified electrodes . One main advantage of the second approach belongs to the ability of preconcentration at open circuit so that no addition of any buffer or electrolyte in the accumulation medium is required. Also, chemical preconcentration can provide improved selectivity. Various modifiers were used for the chemical accumulation of copper species prior to their voltammetric quantification, including ion exchange resins , chelating polymers , clays , and organic ligands .\nChemically modified electrodes involving silica-based materials have recently attracted much attention in the field of electroanalytical chemistry , because they allow to couple advantageously the attractive properties of these materials to a selected redox process. Among them, organically modified silicates (ORMOSILs) hold considerable promise in the development of new devices for analytical and electrochemical applications due to their good mechanical and chemical stability, and the ease with which they can be prepared and modified . Indeed, ORMOSILs combine the rigid three-dimensional structure of the ceramic part (inorganic lattice) with the intrinsic chemical properties of the organic moieties (binding ability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, ion exchange, chelating properties, etc.). Among the wide range of organic functionalities grafted on silica, the covalent attachment of amine groups on silica gel surfaces by reaction with aminopropyl-triethoxysilane has been largely investigated by Vansant and co-workers . The resulting material is liable to take up copper(II) species from dilute solutions , and Cu(II) complexes in organically modified silicate gels have been characterized by various techniques . It was shown recently that these complexes can undergo charge-transfer reactions when incorporated within carbon paste .\nIn a preliminary report , we have performed a semi-quantitative electrochemical evaluation of polysiloxane-immobilized amine ligands with respect to Cu(II) uptake from an aqueous solution. In the present paper, we plan to evaluate carbon paste electrodes modified with aminopropyl-grafted silica gel (APS) as an electrochemical sensor for copper species in aqueous medium. As compared to the voltammetric detection of this analyte with a pure silica-modified carbon paste electrode in ammoniacal medium , this approach would benefit from the covalent binding of the chelating agent (aminopropyl group) to the silica backbone, without requiring an additional reagent (i.e. ammonia) in the preconcentration medium.\nAll the electrolyte and buffer reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Riedel de H\u00e4en. Copper(II) was used as Cu(NO3)2 obtained from Prolabo. All solutions were prepared with high-purity water (18 M\u03a9 cm\u22121) from a millipore milliQ water purification system. Silica gels were the chromatographic grade Kieselgel 40 (K40), Kieselgel 60 (K60), and Kieselgel 100 (K100) from Merck. The reactant (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTEOS) 99% and the toluene solvent were purchased from Aldrich. The APS was prepared by refluxing a suspension made of 6 ml APTEOS in 50 ml dry toluene with 5 g silica gel, for 2 h. The solid was then filtered off, washed several times with toluene, and dried overnight at 120\u00b0C (Fig. 1 ).\nAPS-modified carbon paste electrodes (APS-MCPEs) were prepared by mixing weighed amounts of APS, high purity graphite (Ultra F, 200 mesh, from Johnson Matthey), and mineral oil (Aldrich) thoroughly until obtaining a uniformly wetted paste. Portions of the resulting composite material were then packed into the end of a home-made PTFE cylindrical tube (geometric area: 0.3 cm2) equipped with a screwing stainless steel piston. The surface was smoothed on a piece of weighing paper. When necessary, a new surface was obtained by pushing an excess of paste out of the tube, removing this excess, and polishing again mechanically the electrode surface.\nAnodic stripping square wave voltammetry was conducted with the \u03bc-Autolab potentiostat and GPES electrochemical analysis system (Eco Chemie), equipped with a three-electrode system mounted on a 50 ml cell. All voltammograms were recorded at room temperature. Working electrode was a home-made silica-modified carbon paste electrode (SMCPE), the counter-electrode was a platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode (Metrohm, no. 6.0733.100) served as reference. Square wave voltammetry was applied with a 50 mV modulation amplitude, a 100 MHz frequency, and a 5 mV step potential. All potentials are referred to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.\nAPS samples were characterized by various techniques. Particle-size distributions were measured with the Horiba laser scattering particle-size distribution analyzer LA920. The measurement principle is based on the Mie scattering theory. The apparatus was equipped with two light sources: a He\u2013Ne laser (632.8 nm) and a W halogen lamp. Pore-size distribution, total pore volume, and specific surface area of silica gels were estimated on the basis of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The measurements were performed using the Coulter SA 3100 apparatus. The amine content of the APS samples was determined by acid\u2013base titration, which was monitored by the Metrohm 691 pH meter (electrode: Metrohm, no. 6.0222.100). Quantitative analysis of copper(II) in solution was made by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, plasma 2000, Perkin-Elmer): this was applied to the characterization of copper adsorption processes from batch suspensions of APS samples.\nFor analytical determination of the concentration of copper(II) in aqueous samples, a two-step procedure was followed. The electrode was first immersed in a preconcentration solution containing the target analyte at a given concentration and selected pH (acetate buffer made of 0.1 M sodium acetate adjusted at the appropriate pH value by HNO3 addition), where the accumulation of copper(II) species was achieved chemically by binding to amine ligands, at open circuit, under constant stirring. The electrode was then removed from the accumulation cell, rinsed with water, and transferred to the separate voltammetric cell containing only a supporting electrolyte (10\u22121 M HNO3), while applying immediately a cathodic potential to the electrode to ensure reduction of all the previously accumulated species. Typically, after a 1 min electrolysis at \u22120.5 V, the voltammetric monitoring was performed in the anodic stripping square wave mode. Note that the deposition of metallic copper was carried out directly after the immersion of the electrode in the electrolyte cell and under quiet conditions in order to prevent any loss of analyte in the bulk solution, which could occur as a result of desorption of the previously accumulated copper(II) species if no cathodic potential was applied. For example, a 5\u201310% decrease in the voltammetric response was observed when performing the electrolysis step under stirring. No deaeration of the solutions was required during both the chemical accumulation and electrochemical detection steps. If complete desorption was ensured, the same electrode surface could be reused without any treatment for typically 40 successive experiments. Further use required a renewal of the electrode surface by mechanical smoothing, as usual for sensors based on carbon paste .\nThe synthetic procedure for the covalent grafting of aminopropyl groups on silica gel involves two successive steps: first the physical adsorption of APTEOS on the silica surface, and then a hydrolysis\u2013condensation reaction of the aminosilane with the silanol groups . This reaction was applied to three silica gel samples displaying different porosities and specific surface areas (Table 1 ). As expected, the presence of the organic groups on silica resulted in a decrease of the material porosity, which is easily explained by the intrinsic volume of these groups on the internal surface of the gels. These groups therefore occupy a part of the porous volume of the materials, as demonstrated by results of Table 1, where significant decrease of the total pore volume was observed upon modification. Because of the finite size of the organic group, this effect was more important for small-pore silica samples. For the same reasons, the specific surface area after synthesis was found to decrease significantly as compared to the same material before synthesis by 53% for K40, 47% for K60, and 29% for K100.\nQuantitative analysis of the amount of amine ligands immobilized on the three silica samples was achieved by indirect acid\u2013base titration . The results summarized in Table 1 show that the amine charge is not only controlled by the specific surface area of the silica gel (that is the number of available surface silanol groups), but also by its porosity. For instance, the amine charge of K100 is limited by its rather low specific surface area, while that of K40 is of the same order of magnitude as that of K60 in spite of a higher specific surface area (550 for K40 as compared to 460 for K60), which can be explained by steric limitations due to the smaller pores of K40.\nWhen APS samples were brought in contact with a copper(II) solution, they immediately turned blue, the characteristic color of the amine\u2013copper(II) complexes formed according to Eq. (1) . \ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH2+Cu(II)\u21d4\ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH2\ue5f8Cu(II) The capacity of bonded phases for Cu(II) was determined by batch experiments (100 mg APS in 50 ml solution containing 10\u22122 M Cu(NO3)2 at pH 6). It was observed that the ratio between the amount of amine groups on silica and the observed copper capacity was always the same whatever the APS material. It is concluded from these batch experiments that the adsorption of Cu(II) by APS is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThe above reaction (Eq. (1)) can be exploited for the preconcentration of Cu(II) species prior to their voltammetric quantification by using an APS-MCPE. As compared to carbon paste electrodes modified with pure silica (applied for the determination of copper in ammoniacal medium ), this novel approach prevents from the use of an additional reactant in the solution, since the complexing agent is already attached to the silica-based modifier. The evaluation of the APS-modified electrode as a voltammetric sensor for Cu(II) species requires optimizing the experimental parameters liable to affect both the accumulation and detection steps.\nAs the APS material is an electronic insulator, the voltammetric detection of the previously accumulated Cu(II) species implies a desorption process. According to the investigation of the binding properties of APS towards Cu(II) as a function of pH , an acidic medium was selected as suitable for desorption according to Eq. (2). Cu(II) species leached out from the APS at the electrode/solution interface can be detected directly by reduction (Eq. (3)), but a thorough electrolysis followed by ASV (Eqs. (3) and (4)) was found to be more sensitive and quantitative. \ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH2\ue5f8Cu2++H+\u21d4\ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH3++Cu2+ Cu2++2e\u2212\u21d4Cu(0) Cu(0)\u22122e\u2212\u21d4Cu2+ Fig. 2 demonstrates that the APS-MCPE is sensitive to Cu(II) species after their accumulation at open circuit, and that the detection by ASV exhibited higher sensitivity as lower was the pH of the medium. A detection medium made of 0.1 M HNO3 was selected as the most appropriate to give reproducible results and long-term stability of the sensor. A comparison of three-waveform modes (linear, differential pulse, and square wave) has revealed that the three modes gave a well-defined peak around +0.1 V with the highest sensitivity observed for anodic stripping square wave voltammetry, which was therefore chosen for further experiments.\nTo get quantitative determination in ASV, complete desorption and subsequent electrolysis should be achieved or, at least, the stripping peak must be proportional to the amount of previously accumulated species. Fig. 3 shows that 80% of the maximum signal was obtained after an electrolysis of only 1 min, indicating a rather high transport rate for the analyte at the electrode/solution interface in spite of the fact that the Cu(II) species are mainly located on the internal surface of the silica particles.\nThe response of the APS-MCPE was obviously affected by the composition of the paste. By using carbon pastes containing various ratios of each component and applying them to the analysis of a 10 \u03bcM Cu(II) solution, the square wave voltammetric signals were affected by the percentage of both APS and mineral oil contents (Fig. 4 A and B). It was observed that the sensitivity of the sensor first increased rapidly with increasing the silica content in the paste up to about 20%, and then started to level off and even slightly decreased with higher loadings (Fig. 4A). The rapid rise in the voltammetric signals is of course due to the increase of binding sites at the electrode surface, while the apparent saturation at levels higher than 20% is rather explained by the diminution of the real electrode surface area (proportional to the carbon content in the paste) for the same geometric area. The effect of mineral oil is illustrated in Fig. 4B, and displays a bell-shaped evolution with a maximum around 22%. Too high oil contents would result in increasing the hydrophobic character of the electrode surface, limiting somewhat the interaction of APS with the analyte solution, while too low loadings resulted in rather poor reproducibility due to the lack in compaction of the electrode material.\nAs the ability of APS to concentrate Cu(II) species from dilute solutions arises mainly from the chelating properties of the immobilized amine ligand, the accumulation process is thought to be highly sensitive to pH (Fig. 5 ). The electrode response was very low below pH 5, then increased with pH to reach a maximum value at pH 8. The analysis at pH higher than 8.5 was not allowed because of the precipitation of Cu(II) species in the form of insoluble copper hydroxide. Below pH 6, the ligand properties of amine groups is limited by their acid\u2013base properties (for instance at pH 6 more than 99.99% of these groups are in their protonated form, Eq. (2) shifted towards the formation of ammonium). On the other hand, it could be surprising that these groups still display chelating properties at pH values as low as 6, but this is possible and explained by the very high local concentration of amine groups within the silica matrix (>1 M) enabling the mass action to act as a driving force for the complexation with copper(II).\nBecause the speed of the accumulation process is mainly governed by the diffusion of the analyte into the mesoporous structure of APS, another parameter of primary importance is the silica gel porosity. Fig. 6 compares the effect of the accumulation time on the response of three APS-MCPEs containing the same mass ratio of three different samples of aminopropyl-grafted silica: APS-K40, APS-K60, and APS-K100. These samples differ from each other mainly by their pore size (Table 1). Despite the higher capacity for copper exhibited by APS-K40 and APS-K60 with respect to that of APS-K100, the electrochemical monitoring clearly demonstrates that the electrode prepared with the large-pore APS-K100 resulted in a more sensitive response than that obtained with APS-K60, while the smallest signals were obtained by using the smallest-pore APS-K40. These results allow to conclude to a kinetic control of the accumulation and subsequent detection of copper at the APS-MCPE, and that the porosity of the organically modified silica gel is a key factor in optimizing the sensor\u2019s sensitivity, more important than the amount of amine groups grafted on the material.\nThe optimal parameters selected from the above experiments have been applied to build a calibration curve. The accumulation was performed for 10 min in a solution containing various copper(II) concentrations at pH 7. The detection was carried out in 0.1 M HNO3 after 1 min electrolysis at \u22120.5 V, followed by an ASV analysis in the square wave mode. A linear response in the 5\u00d710\u22128\u20132\u00d710\u22127 M concentration range was observed, which was followed by a decrease in sensitivity at higher concentrations. A detection limit of 3\u00d710\u22129 M was calculated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. This value is better than or of the same order of magnitude as than those previously reported for other chemically modified electrodes.\nBy using this electrochemical sensor, the copper concentration in laboratory tap water was measured by the standard addition method, and a value of 1.6\u00d710\u22127 M was obtained, which was in good agreement with the certified value obtained from the \u201cService Central d\u2019Analyse\u201d of the CNRS at Lyon, France (1.5\u00d710\u22127 M), allowing to conclude a good accuracy of the proposed method.\nThe ability of aminopropyl groups grafted on silica gel (APS) to adsorb Cu(II) by complexation with the amine moieties can be exploited for the voltammetric detection of copper(II) species after their accumulation at open circuit, by resorting to an APS-modified carbon paste electrode. The sensor exhibited the highest response when using silica-based materials displaying the largest porosity, which imparted fast diffusion rates for both the analyte in the preconcentration step and the electrolyte in the detection step. Significant improvement was observed over the use of pure silica-modified electrode because of the presence of the amine groups directly attached to the silica matrix. The voltammetric response was linear in the 5\u00d710\u22128\u20132\u00d710\u22127 M concentration range for a 10 min preconcentration time at open circuit. The present work illustrates the interest of silica-based materials, chemically modified with an organic ligand covalently attached to the backbone, for designing new electrode modifiers liable to be applied to chemical sensing.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "The determination of copper species is of special concern in both environmental and process monitoring. Copper is an essential element at trace level (i.e. catalytic action in heme synthesis) , but the intake of large quantities can be toxic. Sources of copper poisoning include beverages from vending machines, copper or brass vessels, and sometimes water supplies. Monitoring Cu(II) concentration is also becoming important in microelectronics fabrication industry. Thus, the development of simple, reliable, and low-cost techniques for copper determination is essential.\nSeveral electrochemical methods have been worked out for the determination of copper(II), most of them employing anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) in which preconcentration proceeded by either electrodeposition on mercury electrode or chemical accumulation at chemically modified electrodes . One main advantage of the second approach belongs to the ability of preconcentration at open circuit so that no addition of any buffer or electrolyte in the accumulation medium is required. Also, chemical preconcentration can provide improved selectivity. Various modifiers were used for the chemical accumulation of copper species prior to their voltammetric quantification, including ion exchange resins , chelating polymers , clays , and organic ligands .\nChemically modified electrodes involving silica-based materials have recently attracted much attention in the field of electroanalytical chemistry , because they allow to couple advantageously the attractive properties of these materials to a selected redox process. Among them, organically modified silicates (ORMOSILs) hold considerable promise in the development of new devices for analytical and electrochemical applications due to their good mechanical and chemical stability, and the ease with which they can be prepared and modified . Indeed, ORMOSILs combine the rigid three-dimensional structure of the ceramic part (inorganic lattice) with the intrinsic chemical properties of the organic moieties (binding ability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, ion exchange, chelating properties, etc.). Among the wide range of organic functionalities grafted on silica, the covalent attachment of amine groups on silica gel surfaces by reaction with aminopropyl-triethoxysilane has been largely investigated by Vansant and co-workers . The resulting material is liable to take up copper(II) species from dilute solutions , and Cu(II) complexes in organically modified silicate gels have been characterized by various techniques . It was shown recently that these complexes can undergo charge-transfer reactions when incorporated within carbon paste .\nIn a preliminary report , we have performed a semi-quantitative electrochemical evaluation of polysiloxane-immobilized amine ligands with respect to Cu(II) uptake from an aqueous solution. In the present paper, we plan to evaluate carbon paste electrodes modified with aminopropyl-grafted silica gel (APS) as an electrochemical sensor for copper species in aqueous medium. As compared to the voltammetric detection of this analyte with a pure silica-modified carbon paste electrode in ammoniacal medium , this approach would benefit from the covalent binding of the chelating agent (aminopropyl group) to the silica backbone, without requiring an additional reagent (i.e. ammonia) in the preconcentration medium.\nAll the electrolyte and buffer reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Riedel de H\u00e4en. Copper(II) was used as Cu(NO3)2 obtained from Prolabo. All solutions were prepared with high-purity water (18 M\u03a9 cm\u22121) from a millipore milliQ water purification system. Silica gels were the chromatographic grade Kieselgel 40 (K40), Kieselgel 60 (K60), and Kieselgel 100 (K100) from Merck. The reactant (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTEOS) 99% and the toluene solvent were purchased from Aldrich. The APS was prepared by refluxing a suspension made of 6 ml APTEOS in 50 ml dry toluene with 5 g silica gel, for 2 h. The solid was then filtered off, washed several times with toluene, and dried overnight at 120\u00b0C (Fig. 1 ).\nAPS-modified carbon paste electrodes (APS-MCPEs) were prepared by mixing weighed amounts of APS, high purity graphite (Ultra F, 200 mesh, from Johnson Matthey), and mineral oil (Aldrich) thoroughly until obtaining a uniformly wetted paste. Portions of the resulting composite material were then packed into the end of a home-made PTFE cylindrical tube (geometric area: 0.3 cm2) equipped with a screwing stainless steel piston. The surface was smoothed on a piece of weighing paper. When necessary, a new surface was obtained by pushing an excess of paste out of the tube, removing this excess, and polishing again mechanically the electrode surface.\nAnodic stripping square wave voltammetry was conducted with the \u03bc-Autolab potentiostat and GPES electrochemical analysis system (Eco Chemie), equipped with a three-electrode system mounted on a 50 ml cell. All voltammograms were recorded at room temperature. Working electrode was a home-made silica-modified carbon paste electrode (SMCPE), the counter-electrode was a platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode (Metrohm, no. 6.0733.100) served as reference. Square wave voltammetry was applied with a 50 mV modulation amplitude, a 100 MHz frequency, and a 5 mV step potential. All potentials are referred to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.\nAPS samples were characterized by various techniques. Particle-size distributions were measured with the Horiba laser scattering particle-size distribution analyzer LA920. The measurement principle is based on the Mie scattering theory. The apparatus was equipped with two light sources: a He\u2013Ne laser (632.8 nm) and a W halogen lamp. Pore-size distribution, total pore volume, and specific surface area of silica gels were estimated on the basis of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The measurements were performed using the Coulter SA 3100 apparatus. The amine content of the APS samples was determined by acid\u2013base titration, which was monitored by the Metrohm 691 pH meter (electrode: Metrohm, no. 6.0222.100). Quantitative analysis of copper(II) in solution was made by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, plasma 2000, Perkin-Elmer): this was applied to the characterization of copper adsorption processes from batch suspensions of APS samples.\nFor analytical determination of the concentration of copper(II) in aqueous samples, a two-step procedure was followed. The electrode was first immersed in a preconcentration solution containing the target analyte at a given concentration and selected pH (acetate buffer made of 0.1 M sodium acetate adjusted at the appropriate pH value by HNO3 addition), where the accumulation of copper(II) species was achieved chemically by binding to amine ligands, at open circuit, under constant stirring. The electrode was then removed from the accumulation cell, rinsed with water, and transferred to the separate voltammetric cell containing only a supporting electrolyte (10\u22121 M HNO3), while applying immediately a cathodic potential to the electrode to ensure reduction of all the previously accumulated species. Typically, after a 1 min electrolysis at \u22120.5 V, the voltammetric monitoring was performed in the anodic stripping square wave mode. Note that the deposition of metallic copper was carried out directly after the immersion of the electrode in the electrolyte cell and under quiet conditions in order to prevent any loss of analyte in the bulk solution, which could occur as a result of desorption of the previously accumulated copper(II) species if no cathodic potential was applied. For example, a 5\u201310% decrease in the voltammetric response was observed when performing the electrolysis step under stirring. No deaeration of the solutions was required during both the chemical accumulation and electrochemical detection steps. If complete desorption was ensured, the same electrode surface could be reused without any treatment for typically 40 successive experiments. Further use required a renewal of the electrode surface by mechanical smoothing, as usual for sensors based on carbon paste .\nThe synthetic procedure for the covalent grafting of aminopropyl groups on silica gel involves two successive steps: first the physical adsorption of APTEOS on the silica surface, and then a hydrolysis\u2013condensation reaction of the aminosilane with the silanol groups . This reaction was applied to three silica gel samples displaying different porosities and specific surface areas (Table 1 ). As expected, the presence of the organic groups on silica resulted in a decrease of the material porosity, which is easily explained by the intrinsic volume of these groups on the internal surface of the gels. These groups therefore occupy a part of the porous volume of the materials, as demonstrated by results of Table 1, where significant decrease of the total pore volume was observed upon modification. Because of the finite size of the organic group, this effect was more important for small-pore silica samples. For the same reasons, the specific surface area after synthesis was found to decrease significantly as compared to the same material before synthesis by 53% for K40, 47% for K60, and 29% for K100.\nQuantitative analysis of the amount of amine ligands immobilized on the three silica samples was achieved by indirect acid\u2013base titration . The results summarized in Table 1 show that the amine charge is not only controlled by the specific surface area of the silica gel (that is the number of available surface silanol groups), but also by its porosity. For instance, the amine charge of K100 is limited by its rather low specific surface area, while that of K40 is of the same order of magnitude as that of K60 in spite of a higher specific surface area (550 for K40 as compared to 460 for K60), which can be explained by steric limitations due to the smaller pores of K40.\nWhen APS samples were brought in contact with a copper(II) solution, they immediately turned blue, the characteristic color of the amine\u2013copper(II) complexes formed according to Eq. (1) . \ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH2+Cu(II)\u21d4\ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH2\ue5f8Cu(II) The capacity of bonded phases for Cu(II) was determined by batch experiments (100 mg APS in 50 ml solution containing 10\u22122 M Cu(NO3)2 at pH 6). It was observed that the ratio between the amount of amine groups on silica and the observed copper capacity was always the same whatever the APS material. It is concluded from these batch experiments that the adsorption of Cu(II) by APS is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThe above reaction (Eq. (1)) can be exploited for the preconcentration of Cu(II) species prior to their voltammetric quantification by using an APS-MCPE. As compared to carbon paste electrodes modified with pure silica (applied for the determination of copper in ammoniacal medium ), this novel approach prevents from the use of an additional reactant in the solution, since the complexing agent is already attached to the silica-based modifier. The evaluation of the APS-modified electrode as a voltammetric sensor for Cu(II) species requires optimizing the experimental parameters liable to affect both the accumulation and detection steps.\nAs the APS material is an electronic insulator, the voltammetric detection of the previously accumulated Cu(II) species implies a desorption process. According to the investigation of the binding properties of APS towards Cu(II) as a function of pH , an acidic medium was selected as suitable for desorption according to Eq. (2). Cu(II) species leached out from the APS at the electrode/solution interface can be detected directly by reduction (Eq. (3)), but a thorough electrolysis followed by ASV (Eqs. (3) and (4)) was found to be more sensitive and quantitative. \ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH2\ue5f8Cu2++H+\u21d4\ue606SiO2\ue5f8Pr\ue5f8NH3++Cu2+ Cu2++2e\u2212\u21d4Cu(0) Cu(0)\u22122e\u2212\u21d4Cu2+ Fig. 2 demonstrates that the APS-MCPE is sensitive to Cu(II) species after their accumulation at open circuit, and that the detection by ASV exhibited higher sensitivity as lower was the pH of the medium. A detection medium made of 0.1 M HNO3 was selected as the most appropriate to give reproducible results and long-term stability of the sensor. A comparison of three-waveform modes (linear, differential pulse, and square wave) has revealed that the three modes gave a well-defined peak around +0.1 V with the highest sensitivity observed for anodic stripping square wave voltammetry, which was therefore chosen for further experiments.\nTo get quantitative determination in ASV, complete desorption and subsequent electrolysis should be achieved or, at least, the stripping peak must be proportional to the amount of previously accumulated species. Fig. 3 shows that 80% of the maximum signal was obtained after an electrolysis of only 1 min, indicating a rather high transport rate for the analyte at the electrode/solution interface in spite of the fact that the Cu(II) species are mainly located on the internal surface of the silica particles.\nThe response of the APS-MCPE was obviously affected by the composition of the paste. By using carbon pastes containing various ratios of each component and applying them to the analysis of a 10 \u03bcM Cu(II) solution, the square wave voltammetric signals were affected by the percentage of both APS and mineral oil contents (Fig. 4 A and B). It was observed that the sensitivity of the sensor first increased rapidly with increasing the silica content in the paste up to about 20%, and then started to level off and even slightly decreased with higher loadings (Fig. 4A). The rapid rise in the voltammetric signals is of course due to the increase of binding sites at the electrode surface, while the apparent saturation at levels higher than 20% is rather explained by the diminution of the real electrode surface area (proportional to the carbon content in the paste) for the same geometric area. The effect of mineral oil is illustrated in Fig. 4B, and displays a bell-shaped evolution with a maximum around 22%. Too high oil contents would result in increasing the hydrophobic character of the electrode surface, limiting somewhat the interaction of APS with the analyte solution, while too low loadings resulted in rather poor reproducibility due to the lack in compaction of the electrode material.\nAs the ability of APS to concentrate Cu(II) species from dilute solutions arises mainly from the chelating properties of the immobilized amine ligand, the accumulation process is thought to be highly sensitive to pH (Fig. 5 ). The electrode response was very low below pH 5, then increased with pH to reach a maximum value at pH 8. The analysis at pH higher than 8.5 was not allowed because of the precipitation of Cu(II) species in the form of insoluble copper hydroxide. Below pH 6, the ligand properties of amine groups is limited by their acid\u2013base properties (for instance at pH 6 more than 99.99% of these groups are in their protonated form, Eq. (2) shifted towards the formation of ammonium). On the other hand, it could be surprising that these groups still display chelating properties at pH values as low as 6, but this is possible and explained by the very high local concentration of amine groups within the silica matrix (>1 M) enabling the mass action to act as a driving force for the complexation with copper(II).\nBecause the speed of the accumulation process is mainly governed by the diffusion of the analyte into the mesoporous structure of APS, another parameter of primary importance is the silica gel porosity. Fig. 6 compares the effect of the accumulation time on the response of three APS-MCPEs containing the same mass ratio of three different samples of aminopropyl-grafted silica: APS-K40, APS-K60, and APS-K100. These samples differ from each other mainly by their pore size (Table 1). Despite the higher capacity for copper exhibited by APS-K40 and APS-K60 with respect to that of APS-K100, the electrochemical monitoring clearly demonstrates that the electrode prepared with the large-pore APS-K100 resulted in a more sensitive response than that obtained with APS-K60, while the smallest signals were obtained by using the smallest-pore APS-K40. These results allow to conclude to a kinetic control of the accumulation and subsequent detection of copper at the APS-MCPE, and that the porosity of the organically modified silica gel is a key factor in optimizing the sensor\u2019s sensitivity, more important than the amount of amine groups grafted on the material.\nThe optimal parameters selected from the above experiments have been applied to build a calibration curve. The accumulation was performed for 10 min in a solution containing various copper(II) concentrations at pH 7. The detection was carried out in 0.1 M HNO3 after 1 min electrolysis at \u22120.5 V, followed by an ASV analysis in the square wave mode. A linear response in the 5\u00d710\u22128\u20132\u00d710\u22127 M concentration range was observed, which was followed by a decrease in sensitivity at higher concentrations. A detection limit of 3\u00d710\u22129 M was calculated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. This value is better than or of the same order of magnitude as than those previously reported for other chemically modified electrodes.\nBy using this electrochemical sensor, the copper concentration in laboratory tap water was measured by the standard addition method, and a value of 1.6\u00d710\u22127 M was obtained, which was in good agreement with the certified value obtained from the \u201cService Central d\u2019Analyse\u201d of the CNRS at Lyon, France (1.5\u00d710\u22127 M), allowing to conclude a good accuracy of the proposed method.\nThe ability of aminopropyl groups grafted on silica gel (APS) to adsorb Cu(II) by complexation with the amine moieties can be exploited for the voltammetric detection of copper(II) species after their accumulation at open circuit, by resorting to an APS-modified carbon paste electrode. The sensor exhibited the highest response when using silica-based materials displaying the largest porosity, which imparted fast diffusion rates for both the analyte in the preconcentration step and the electrolyte in the detection step. Significant improvement was observed over the use of pure silica-modified electrode because of the presence of the amine groups directly attached to the silica matrix. The voltammetric response was linear in the 5\u00d710\u22128\u20132\u00d710\u22127 M concentration range for a 10 min preconcentration time at open circuit. The present work illustrates the interest of silica-based materials, chemically modified with an organic ligand covalently attached to the backbone, for designing new electrode modifiers liable to be applied to chemical sensing."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nMiniaturization of chemical sensors is a major requirement in industrial applications. Demands of increasing importance include very sensitive analyte detection, determination of physical properties on minute amounts of material, continuous quality and process control, measurement of small quantities, a versatile application range, the ability to tailor sensors to applications, and so forth. Miniaturization also entails greater complexity, higher functionality and compactness. Here, we present a type of sensor that takes advantage of a transduction method different to those in other chemical sensors. Instead of detecting changes in, e.g. electrical properties of sensor materials, we measure mechanical responses of thin beams of silicon, so-called microcantilevers, arranged in a microfabricated array. Each of these cantilevers is coated on one side with a sensor layer that shows an individual response to analyte molecules. To obtain information on the analyte, we investigate cantilever responses due to diffusion processes of the analyte in the sensor layer or chemical reactions with the sensor layer. The sensor layer transduces changes of its physical properties or energy transfers related to chemical reactions into a mechanical response. When the sensor layer is exposed to an analyte, the cantilevers mechanically respond by bending on the nanometer scale because of surface stress change or heat transfer and by mass change. The latter is detected by measuring resonance-frequency shifts while actuating the cantilever (dynamic mode). Static deflection can be extracted from this signal by filtering out the ac component. The remaining dc signal reflects the bending due to surface stress change at the interface between cantilever and polymer layer during absorption of molecules. If heat transfer is involved (e.g. from chemical reactions or phase transitions), bimaterial effects such as cantilever bending due to temperature changes in the bimetallic structure occur in addition to the static deflection owing to surface stress changes.\nFig. 1 shows the static and dynamic operation modes of the microcantilevers and a scanning electron micrograph of a cantilever array.\nThese cantilever-based sensor techniques are derived from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique, which utilizes a sharp tip to scan a surface topography controlled by a feedback loop, e.g. by keeping the force between tip and surface constant. For the use as a chemical sensor, neither a tip nor a feedback loop is required. To obtain chemical functionality, free-standing cantilever beams are coated by sensor layers or samples are attached directly to the cantilever beam prior to exposure to the analyte vapor. The mechanical response in either, the static mode (deflection) or the dynamic mode (shift of resonance-frequency) is measured on the free-standing cantilever without resorting to a feedback loop.\nCantilever sensors can be employed in miniaturized versions of equivalent \u201cclassical\u201d methods, often with increased sensitivity. Initial experiments on catalytical reactions demonstrated that picojoule-level sensitivity in calorimetry can be achieved using the cantilever techniques. Calorimetric investigations of an alkane sample have been performed directly on the cantilever, an example being the study of solid\u2013solid phase transitions in alkanes , down to the picomole level . Single-cantilever sensors have been successfully used to study photothermal spectroscopy , surface stress and infrared light absorption . In the dynamic measuring mode, several operation conditions have been proposed, and tested. By determining the resonance-frequency of the cantilever before and after mounting a small sample at the cantilever apex the mass of the sample can be measured with sub-picogram resolution. Subjecting the sample attached to the resonating cantilever to programmed heating in a controlled environment allows thermogravimetry on nanogram amounts of a sample . By coating the cantilever with a sensor layer, the resonating cantilever can detect a wide range of analyte concentrations in the environment.\nIn the so-called static mode, the static deflection of the cantilever on exposure to an analyte is measured. This bending is caused by surface stress changes due to analyte interaction with the sensor coating of the cantilever . Operating a cantilever in the static mode in liquids, makes it possible to use the device as a biosensor. Detection of protein adsorption, antibody\u2013antigen recognition, and DNA hybridization has been successfully demonstrated .\nThe use of cantilevers in arrays provides the capability of measuring differential responses, i.e. differences between cantilever responses. Some of the cantilevers are coated with sensor layers, such as metal coatings that react with analytes, whereas others are coated with a layer inert to the analytes presented, e.g. a gold layer. Reactions that affect the entire cantilever array, such as reactions on the uncoated back side of cantilevers as well as thermal drifts and calibration offsets, can be cancelled out using differential measurements .\nA cantilever is characterized by its geometrical dimensions, its spring constant and its resonance-frequency. The spring constant can be calculated in the following way : k=EtCant3wCant(4lCant3)\u22121, where t Cant, w Cant and l Cant are the thickness, width and length of the cantilever, respectively, and E the Young\u2019s modulus of the material used (Si). Eq. (1) is only valid for l Cant\u2aa2t Cant.\nThe resonance-frequency of a long and thin rectangular cantilever is calculated according to f0=(2\u03c0)\u22121E\u03c1\u22121/2tCantlCant2, where \u03c1 is the density of the cantilever material.\nAbsorption of analyte vapor in the sensor layer produces stress at the interface between the cantilever and the sensor layer, leading to a bending of the cantilever. Stoney\u2019s law gives the dependence of the surface stress change on the bending radius of the cantilever: \u03c3=EtCant2(6R(1\u2212\u03bd))\u22121, where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the cantilever material and R the bending radius of the cantilever. The following material constants for silicon have been used: E=1.7\u00d71011 N/m2, \u03c1=2.33\u00d7103 kg/m3, and \u03bd=0.25.\nVia the oscillation of the cantilever at its resonance-frequency using an external piezoelectric crystal, small changes in cantilever mass can be detected. This implies its application as a highly sensitive microbalance capable of resolving mass changes in the sub-picogram range. The mass change depends on the resonance-frequency of the oscillating cantilever in the following way: \u0394m=k(4n\u03c0)\u22121(f1\u22122\u2212f0\u22122).\nHere, k denotes the spring constant of the cantilever, n is a geometry-dependent correction factor (n=0.24 for rectangular cantilevers), f 0 the resonance-frequency prior to the experiment, and f 1 the resonance-frequency during the experiment. Eq. (4) is only valid if the spring constant k does not change during the experiment. Diffusion of analyte molecules through the cantilever coating may change the elastic constants of the cantilever.\nCantilever sensor arrays have been microfabricated at the Micromechanics Department of IBM\u2019s Zurich Research Laboratory from silicon using combined dry and wet etching techniques. A series of eight cantilevers is assembled in a chip. The cantilever dimensions are chosen depending on the application. The length of the cantilevers was selected to be 500 \u03bcm, their width 100 \u03bcm. For operation in the dynamic mode, a thickness of 8.6 \u03bcm was chosen, resulting in a resonance-frequency of approximately 50 kHz. For operation in the static mode, the thickness was selected to be approximately 1.2 \u03bcm. Eight cantilever sensors are linearly arranged at a pitch of 250 \u03bcm.\nThe sensor array is placed in an analysis chamber that holds the components for detection of cantilever responses. These include optical cantilever-deflection detection by means of an array of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL, Avalon Photonics Zurich, Switzerland), collimation optics, and a position-sensitive detector (PSD, SiTek, Partille, Sweden). In addition, the measurement setup comprises a gas-handling system for controlling the gas flow through the analysis chamber, data-acquisition and control electronics, and a personal computer (PC) that controls the gas flow and cantilever readout. Fig. 2 schematically shows the measurement setup. The analysis chamber consists of a small x\u2013y positioning table for alignment of cantilevers and light sources, a piezoelectric crystal for actuation of the cantilever array, a tube containing the VCSEL light sources, collimation optics, and PSD including a current\u2013voltage converter and preamplifier. Analyte vapor is introduced into the chamber via a sample port consisting of a vial containing the analyte. Two syringes are introduced in the sample headspace, one to blow dry nitrogen gas into the headspace regulated by a mass flow controller/meter (Bronkhorst HI-TEC, AK Ruurlo, The Netherlands), the other for probing the headspace. Two valves are used to allow the nitrogen gas flow to bypass the analyte headspace for purging the analyte chamber.\nThe deflection of the cantilever sensors is read out optically via a beam-deflection technique. A linear array of eight VCSEL is sequentially addressed in a time-multiplexing mode such that at any time only one light source is switched on allowing the deflection of each cantilever to be determined sequentially using only one PSD. The switching frequency is typically 3 Hz. A collimation optics consisting of two achromatic doublets lenses produces a 1:1 projection of the light sources onto the cantilever sensors. The light is reflected off the cantilever surface and collected by a linear PSD. A two-stage preamplifier is mounted directly on the back side of the PSD to transform the currents produced by the incident light spot into voltages. This determines the position of the light spot on the PSD. The voltages are digitized by an analog-to-digital conversion board and stored on the PC. The acquisition and control electronics triggers the switching of the VCSEL light sources.\nThe voltages indicating the position of the incident light spot on the PSD are amplified by a preamplifier. Electronics developed in-house is used for data-acquisition, preprocessing and amplification. A microcontroller-based printed circuit board (PCB) controlled by software on the PC converts the deflection signals into a digital format and sends commands for time-multiplexing of the VCSEL light sources and communication with the other PCBs via a Bus system. A phase-locked loop (PLL) PCB is used for frequency demodulation in the dynamic mode. Additional boards are responsible for acquisition of static cantilever deflections and intensity control of the VCSEL light sources. The PCBs use memory in the microcontroller (memory mapping), which enables a high access speed and simplified programming procedures. The microcontroller also transmits commands for switching the valves.\nThe signal from the oscillating cantilever consists of an ac and a dc component. The resonance frequencies of the cantilevers are determined by demodulating the frequency of the cantilever response measured so as to obtain the ac component of the signal. The static deflection signal (dc component) is generated from the cantilever response by eliminating the ac component in the signal via lowpass filtering. The properties of the lowpass filter are chosen in such a way that the sampling theorem is fulfilled, i.e. no aliasing occurs. To compensate any individual initial bending of the cantilevers, an offset voltage is added to the dc component prior to measurements.\nAs differences in cantilever responses might not be evident at first glance, refined procedures for data processing have to be applied, such as artificial neural networks (ANN). ANN approximate relations between input and output signals based on appropriate training procedures and a sufficient number of training data sets. Here, we used a multilayer perceptron topology of the neural network and trained it with a backpropagation algorithm.\nCantilever arrays have been functionalized by coating individual cantilevers with a polymer layer having a thickness of 2\u20133 \u03bcm by spreading a droplet of polymer solution on each cantilever. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the cantilever coatings used in the experiments. Other cantilever arrays have been coated uniformly with polyvinylchloride (PVC).\nAn amount of 2 ml of liquid analyte is filled into a vial closed by a septum. Analyte vapor in the vial headspace is extracted and transferred to the analyte chamber using a flow of dry nitrogen saturated with analyte vapor. The total flow (analyte vapor and dry nitrogen) through the analyte chamber is kept constant at a value of 100 ml/min, controlled by digital mass flow meters/controllers. In experiments \u201c90% analyte\u201d means that 90 ml/min dry nitrogen saturated with analyte vapor is added to 10 ml/min of dry nitrogen. To avoid delays in adjusting the gas flows, two electrically controlled three-terminal valves are used to direct the gas flow through the analyte vial or to bypass the vial. To avoid pressure changes, tube resistances have been selected to be equal in both paths. After typically 130 s of cleaning with dry nitrogen, the valves are switched to allow analyte vapor to be directed through the analyte chamber for 120 s. After this exposure step, dry nitrogen is allowed to flow through the analyte chamber during typically 300 s to purge chamber and tubes.\nDetection of water vapor plays an important role in many applications. To investigate which cantilever coatings are suitable for detecting water, a sensor array functionalized according to Table 1 was used. Fig. 3 shows simultaneously acquired dynamic and static cantilever responses on exposure to various concentrations of water vapor. It is remarkable that certain sensors show quite a large response to water vapor (frequency shift up to 120 Hz and 250 nm deflection) whereas others do not. Especially, cantilever coating consisting of polymers soluble in water, such as PVA, CMC and PVP, show large signals. The signals are produced by diffusion of analyte into the polymer layer, resulting in a swelling of the polymer. The mass increase implies a decrease in resonance-frequency and a change in surface stress at the interface between the polymer and the cantilever surface, which results in a bending of the cantilever. The deflection signal increases owing to the compressive nature of the surface stress change on the functionalized surface of the cantilevers. After the flow of nitrogen gas saturated with analyte has been exchanged for a flow of dry nitrogen gas, the analyte diffused into the polymer layer begins to diffuse out of the polymer into the environment, leading to a decrease of mass on the cantilever: the resonance-frequency increases. Simultaneously, the surface stress at the interface between polymer layer and cantilever is reduced, resulting in a decrease in deflection. Note that the dynamic and static responses do not reach a constant value for all concentrations and that the time constants differ in static and dynamic modes. This is due to the fact that the static response is dominated by stress change at the surface, and the dynamic response results from the diffusion of the analyte within the polymer, simultaneously with a partial dissolution of the polymer.\nThe chemical nature of the polymer layer is responsible for hydrophilicity, polarity and extent of swelling capability of the cantilever coating, producing various types of calibration curves depending on polymer material. Whereas polymers, such as PVA, CMC and PVP strongly absorb water, other polymers such as PU, PS and PMMA are relatively insensitive against water exposure (maximum frequency shifts of typically 10 Hz and maximum deflections of 30 nm). The PVC-coated sensor exhibits a cantilever response in an intermediate range.\nA standard system of analytes is the homologous series of primary alcohols. Based on the findings in the preceeding section, all cantilevers in an array were coated with a PVC polymer layer to reduce the sensitivity against water on the one hand and to provide signals sufficiently large to be measured easily on the other hand. The analyte concentration was set to 90%. Typical cantilever responses measured are shown in Fig. 4 for methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. The largest and fastest cantilever reponses in both dynamic and static mode are observed in methanol, which is the smallest of the analyte molecules investigated. Methanol has the largest vapor pressure among the primary alcohols. The small size of the molecule implies short diffusion times within the polymer. After the experiment, the initial baseline level is reached again, proving the reversibility of the experiment.\nTo study the influence of the analyte concentration on the cantilever responses, we varied the analyte gas flow from 20 to 90 ml/min, in steps of 10 ml/min. The total flow through the analyte chamber was kept constant at a value of 100 ml/min by mixing the analyte gas flow with the corresponding amount of dry nitrogen gas. Fig. 5 shows the dependence on analyte concentration of the cantilever responses in dynamic and static modes for a PVC-coated cantilever. The measurable concentration range depends on the polymer material selected. For example, PMMA allows responses in the dynamic mode to be measured between 10 and 90% analyte. A chart plotting concentration versus maximum frequency shift and concentration versus maximum deflection reveals an increase in the magnitude of cantilever response with concentration (Fig. 6 ). The dependence is linear for the deflection signal, and is strictly monotonous for the resonance-frequency shift signal, but exhibits higher-order terms, such as a parabolic term. Such a deviation from the linear dependence may be interpreted as contributions due to changes in the elastic constants of the cantilever. A decrease in the cantilever spring constant owing to swelling of the polymer layer implies a softening of the coated cantilever. Such an effect would produce the observed increase in frequency shifts at high analyte concentrations.\nThe analyte injection time determines the amount of analyte that is transferred to the cantilever array. If the amount of analyte is too large, the polymer layer might be saturated, and additional analyte will no longer produce an increase in the signal. We varied the injection time of methanol vapor into the analysis chamber from 60 to 200 s in steps of 20 s, using the same cantilever array with PVC coating on all cantilevers as above. As expected, an increase in frequency shift and deflection is observed with increasing injection time (Fig. 7 ). This reflects the mass increase of analyte in the polymer. Whereas in the dynamic mode no saturation is observed, the static cantilever response levels off for longer injection times. As the interface area between cantilever surface and polymer layer is responsible for the static deflection signal, the range of useful injection times is smaller than in the dynamic mode, where the volume of the polymer layer determines the saturation limit.\nIn addition, the headspace volume, i.e. the volume above the liquid in the analyte vial filled with analyte vapor, could influence the cantilever responses. However, no dependence of the cantilever responses in dynamic or static modes was observed by varying the headspace volume by a factor of four. This implies that in all our experiments the headspace volume was sufficiently large to be able to saturate the analyte gas flow with analyte.\nIn contrast to polar analytes, such as primary alcohols and water, alkanes are apolar molecules. This has an impact on the diffusion properties in the polymer. In this subsection, the results on the homologous series of alkanes (hexane to dodecane) using PVC-coated cantilevers are presented. Fig. 8 shows cantilever responses in dynamic and static mode for various alkanes. Interestingly, the maximum frequency shift does not increase in a monotonous way as a function of chain length. Moreover, the cantilever responses in dynamic mode can be divided into two groups of analytes: one group consisting of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms, the other of alkanes having an odd number of carbon atoms. No such separation is observed in static mode. The reason for this can be found in the differing structural and physical properties. Alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms exhibit higher melting points than those with an odd number of carbon atoms. A similar behavior is also found for the boiling points. This implies a slightly larger vapor pressure for alkanes having an odd number of carbon atoms than for those having one carbon atom fewer. Alkanes with a shorter chain produce cantilever responses with larger frequency shift and deflection than alkanes with a longer chain do, as the former have a larger vapor pressure than the latter. This implies that the concentration of heptane is actually higher than that of hexane even though the analyte gas flows are adjusted to the same value (90 ml/min).\nAn example for the characterization of complex analytes is the investigation of perfume oils (Spinnrad GmbH, Gelsenkirchen, Germany). We selected perfume samples with a standardized content of 2.5% perfume oil in ethanol: \u2018Rose\u2019, \u2018Camomile\u2019, \u2018Heliotropin\u2019, \u2018Corps\u2019 and \u2018Leather\u2019. Of perfume oil, 100 \u03bcl was filled into a closed vial. A dry nitrogen gas flow of 80 ml/min was saturated with these analytes. A cantilever array functionalized as displayed in Table 1 was exposed to the analytes for 120 s. Fig. 9 shows all the cantilever responses in the dynamic mode in one graph. The curves were normalized to the magnitude of sensor 3 for later use with neural network techniques. Every measurement produces a new curve, which is the data set for a neural network. Differences between individual perfume oils can be observed when comparing, for example, the responses of sensor 1. We observe that the curves measured are very similar for each of the analytes.\nA feed forward neural network was trained with a set of five curves per analyte using a gradient descent momentum backpropagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate. The topology of the neural net is displayed in Table 3 . The learning curve displaying the mean squared error during validation for the perfume training sets is shown in Fig. 10 (a). The neural net is able to gather information on analytes (training curve) and has the capability to generalize because the mean squared error of the validation curve decreases in an similar way compared as does the training curve. If the neural net is presented one of the 10 validation data sets (which have not been used for training), the neurons in the third layer produce a response. The validation data set shown in Fig. 10(b) acquired on the heliotropin perfume oil produces a neural network response close to one for heliotropin, see Fig. 10(c). This implies that the trained neural network is capable of identifying perfume vapors after presentation of the training sets.\nWe demonstrated the application of micromechanical cantilever arrays as chemical sensors using a setup for the simultaneous detection of resonance-frequency and bending. Information on cantilever bending and resonance-frequency shifts during exposure to analyte vapor can be used for qualitative and quantitative characterization and recognition of a variety of chemical substances, such as water, primary alcohols, and alkanes. Based on the pattern of cantilever responses, the setup can be used for the characterization of complex analytes, such as perfume oils. The discrimination power is greatly enhanced by the use of neural network techniques. Application areas of such sensors are mainly in quality and process control. The application of functionalized cantilever arrays as chemical sensors is only a first step towards a widespread use of micromechanical structures. Recent publications point out the large potential of biochemical applications using micromechanical sensors in liquids for the study of protein adsorption, antibody\u2013antigen recognition, DNA hybridization, and rapid medical diagnostics. Sensing is not the only application of micromechanical structures. By using functionalized nanomechanical membranes as lid, a container could open in presence of drugs to release other substances very locally.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Miniaturization of chemical sensors is a major requirement in industrial applications. Demands of increasing importance include very sensitive analyte detection, determination of physical properties on minute amounts of material, continuous quality and process control, measurement of small quantities, a versatile application range, the ability to tailor sensors to applications, and so forth. Miniaturization also entails greater complexity, higher functionality and compactness. Here, we present a type of sensor that takes advantage of a transduction method different to those in other chemical sensors. Instead of detecting changes in, e.g. electrical properties of sensor materials, we measure mechanical responses of thin beams of silicon, so-called microcantilevers, arranged in a microfabricated array. Each of these cantilevers is coated on one side with a sensor layer that shows an individual response to analyte molecules. To obtain information on the analyte, we investigate cantilever responses due to diffusion processes of the analyte in the sensor layer or chemical reactions with the sensor layer. The sensor layer transduces changes of its physical properties or energy transfers related to chemical reactions into a mechanical response. When the sensor layer is exposed to an analyte, the cantilevers mechanically respond by bending on the nanometer scale because of surface stress change or heat transfer and by mass change. The latter is detected by measuring resonance-frequency shifts while actuating the cantilever (dynamic mode). Static deflection can be extracted from this signal by filtering out the ac component. The remaining dc signal reflects the bending due to surface stress change at the interface between cantilever and polymer layer during absorption of molecules. If heat transfer is involved (e.g. from chemical reactions or phase transitions), bimaterial effects such as cantilever bending due to temperature changes in the bimetallic structure occur in addition to the static deflection owing to surface stress changes.\nFig. 1 shows the static and dynamic operation modes of the microcantilevers and a scanning electron micrograph of a cantilever array.\nThese cantilever-based sensor techniques are derived from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique, which utilizes a sharp tip to scan a surface topography controlled by a feedback loop, e.g. by keeping the force between tip and surface constant. For the use as a chemical sensor, neither a tip nor a feedback loop is required. To obtain chemical functionality, free-standing cantilever beams are coated by sensor layers or samples are attached directly to the cantilever beam prior to exposure to the analyte vapor. The mechanical response in either, the static mode (deflection) or the dynamic mode (shift of resonance-frequency) is measured on the free-standing cantilever without resorting to a feedback loop.\nCantilever sensors can be employed in miniaturized versions of equivalent \u201cclassical\u201d methods, often with increased sensitivity. Initial experiments on catalytical reactions demonstrated that picojoule-level sensitivity in calorimetry can be achieved using the cantilever techniques. Calorimetric investigations of an alkane sample have been performed directly on the cantilever, an example being the study of solid\u2013solid phase transitions in alkanes , down to the picomole level . Single-cantilever sensors have been successfully used to study photothermal spectroscopy , surface stress and infrared light absorption . In the dynamic measuring mode, several operation conditions have been proposed, and tested. By determining the resonance-frequency of the cantilever before and after mounting a small sample at the cantilever apex the mass of the sample can be measured with sub-picogram resolution. Subjecting the sample attached to the resonating cantilever to programmed heating in a controlled environment allows thermogravimetry on nanogram amounts of a sample . By coating the cantilever with a sensor layer, the resonating cantilever can detect a wide range of analyte concentrations in the environment.\nIn the so-called static mode, the static deflection of the cantilever on exposure to an analyte is measured. This bending is caused by surface stress changes due to analyte interaction with the sensor coating of the cantilever . Operating a cantilever in the static mode in liquids, makes it possible to use the device as a biosensor. Detection of protein adsorption, antibody\u2013antigen recognition, and DNA hybridization has been successfully demonstrated .\nThe use of cantilevers in arrays provides the capability of measuring differential responses, i.e. differences between cantilever responses. Some of the cantilevers are coated with sensor layers, such as metal coatings that react with analytes, whereas others are coated with a layer inert to the analytes presented, e.g. a gold layer. Reactions that affect the entire cantilever array, such as reactions on the uncoated back side of cantilevers as well as thermal drifts and calibration offsets, can be cancelled out using differential measurements .\nA cantilever is characterized by its geometrical dimensions, its spring constant and its resonance-frequency. The spring constant can be calculated in the following way : k=EtCant3wCant(4lCant3)\u22121, where t Cant, w Cant and l Cant are the thickness, width and length of the cantilever, respectively, and E the Young\u2019s modulus of the material used (Si). Eq. (1) is only valid for l Cant\u2aa2t Cant.\nThe resonance-frequency of a long and thin rectangular cantilever is calculated according to f0=(2\u03c0)\u22121E\u03c1\u22121/2tCantlCant2, where \u03c1 is the density of the cantilever material.\nAbsorption of analyte vapor in the sensor layer produces stress at the interface between the cantilever and the sensor layer, leading to a bending of the cantilever. Stoney\u2019s law gives the dependence of the surface stress change on the bending radius of the cantilever: \u03c3=EtCant2(6R(1\u2212\u03bd))\u22121, where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the cantilever material and R the bending radius of the cantilever. The following material constants for silicon have been used: E=1.7\u00d71011 N/m2, \u03c1=2.33\u00d7103 kg/m3, and \u03bd=0.25.\nVia the oscillation of the cantilever at its resonance-frequency using an external piezoelectric crystal, small changes in cantilever mass can be detected. This implies its application as a highly sensitive microbalance capable of resolving mass changes in the sub-picogram range. The mass change depends on the resonance-frequency of the oscillating cantilever in the following way: \u0394m=k(4n\u03c0)\u22121(f1\u22122\u2212f0\u22122).\nHere, k denotes the spring constant of the cantilever, n is a geometry-dependent correction factor (n=0.24 for rectangular cantilevers), f 0 the resonance-frequency prior to the experiment, and f 1 the resonance-frequency during the experiment. Eq. (4) is only valid if the spring constant k does not change during the experiment. Diffusion of analyte molecules through the cantilever coating may change the elastic constants of the cantilever.\nCantilever sensor arrays have been microfabricated at the Micromechanics Department of IBM\u2019s Zurich Research Laboratory from silicon using combined dry and wet etching techniques. A series of eight cantilevers is assembled in a chip. The cantilever dimensions are chosen depending on the application. The length of the cantilevers was selected to be 500 \u03bcm, their width 100 \u03bcm. For operation in the dynamic mode, a thickness of 8.6 \u03bcm was chosen, resulting in a resonance-frequency of approximately 50 kHz. For operation in the static mode, the thickness was selected to be approximately 1.2 \u03bcm. Eight cantilever sensors are linearly arranged at a pitch of 250 \u03bcm.\nThe sensor array is placed in an analysis chamber that holds the components for detection of cantilever responses. These include optical cantilever-deflection detection by means of an array of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL, Avalon Photonics Zurich, Switzerland), collimation optics, and a position-sensitive detector (PSD, SiTek, Partille, Sweden). In addition, the measurement setup comprises a gas-handling system for controlling the gas flow through the analysis chamber, data-acquisition and control electronics, and a personal computer (PC) that controls the gas flow and cantilever readout. Fig. 2 schematically shows the measurement setup. The analysis chamber consists of a small x\u2013y positioning table for alignment of cantilevers and light sources, a piezoelectric crystal for actuation of the cantilever array, a tube containing the VCSEL light sources, collimation optics, and PSD including a current\u2013voltage converter and preamplifier. Analyte vapor is introduced into the chamber via a sample port consisting of a vial containing the analyte. Two syringes are introduced in the sample headspace, one to blow dry nitrogen gas into the headspace regulated by a mass flow controller/meter (Bronkhorst HI-TEC, AK Ruurlo, The Netherlands), the other for probing the headspace. Two valves are used to allow the nitrogen gas flow to bypass the analyte headspace for purging the analyte chamber.\nThe deflection of the cantilever sensors is read out optically via a beam-deflection technique. A linear array of eight VCSEL is sequentially addressed in a time-multiplexing mode such that at any time only one light source is switched on allowing the deflection of each cantilever to be determined sequentially using only one PSD. The switching frequency is typically 3 Hz. A collimation optics consisting of two achromatic doublets lenses produces a 1:1 projection of the light sources onto the cantilever sensors. The light is reflected off the cantilever surface and collected by a linear PSD. A two-stage preamplifier is mounted directly on the back side of the PSD to transform the currents produced by the incident light spot into voltages. This determines the position of the light spot on the PSD. The voltages are digitized by an analog-to-digital conversion board and stored on the PC. The acquisition and control electronics triggers the switching of the VCSEL light sources.\nThe voltages indicating the position of the incident light spot on the PSD are amplified by a preamplifier. Electronics developed in-house is used for data-acquisition, preprocessing and amplification. A microcontroller-based printed circuit board (PCB) controlled by software on the PC converts the deflection signals into a digital format and sends commands for time-multiplexing of the VCSEL light sources and communication with the other PCBs via a Bus system. A phase-locked loop (PLL) PCB is used for frequency demodulation in the dynamic mode. Additional boards are responsible for acquisition of static cantilever deflections and intensity control of the VCSEL light sources. The PCBs use memory in the microcontroller (memory mapping), which enables a high access speed and simplified programming procedures. The microcontroller also transmits commands for switching the valves.\nThe signal from the oscillating cantilever consists of an ac and a dc component. The resonance frequencies of the cantilevers are determined by demodulating the frequency of the cantilever response measured so as to obtain the ac component of the signal. The static deflection signal (dc component) is generated from the cantilever response by eliminating the ac component in the signal via lowpass filtering. The properties of the lowpass filter are chosen in such a way that the sampling theorem is fulfilled, i.e. no aliasing occurs. To compensate any individual initial bending of the cantilevers, an offset voltage is added to the dc component prior to measurements.\nAs differences in cantilever responses might not be evident at first glance, refined procedures for data processing have to be applied, such as artificial neural networks (ANN). ANN approximate relations between input and output signals based on appropriate training procedures and a sufficient number of training data sets. Here, we used a multilayer perceptron topology of the neural network and trained it with a backpropagation algorithm.\nCantilever arrays have been functionalized by coating individual cantilevers with a polymer layer having a thickness of 2\u20133 \u03bcm by spreading a droplet of polymer solution on each cantilever. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the cantilever coatings used in the experiments. Other cantilever arrays have been coated uniformly with polyvinylchloride (PVC).\nAn amount of 2 ml of liquid analyte is filled into a vial closed by a septum. Analyte vapor in the vial headspace is extracted and transferred to the analyte chamber using a flow of dry nitrogen saturated with analyte vapor. The total flow (analyte vapor and dry nitrogen) through the analyte chamber is kept constant at a value of 100 ml/min, controlled by digital mass flow meters/controllers. In experiments \u201c90% analyte\u201d means that 90 ml/min dry nitrogen saturated with analyte vapor is added to 10 ml/min of dry nitrogen. To avoid delays in adjusting the gas flows, two electrically controlled three-terminal valves are used to direct the gas flow through the analyte vial or to bypass the vial. To avoid pressure changes, tube resistances have been selected to be equal in both paths. After typically 130 s of cleaning with dry nitrogen, the valves are switched to allow analyte vapor to be directed through the analyte chamber for 120 s. After this exposure step, dry nitrogen is allowed to flow through the analyte chamber during typically 300 s to purge chamber and tubes.\nDetection of water vapor plays an important role in many applications. To investigate which cantilever coatings are suitable for detecting water, a sensor array functionalized according to Table 1 was used. Fig. 3 shows simultaneously acquired dynamic and static cantilever responses on exposure to various concentrations of water vapor. It is remarkable that certain sensors show quite a large response to water vapor (frequency shift up to 120 Hz and 250 nm deflection) whereas others do not. Especially, cantilever coating consisting of polymers soluble in water, such as PVA, CMC and PVP, show large signals. The signals are produced by diffusion of analyte into the polymer layer, resulting in a swelling of the polymer. The mass increase implies a decrease in resonance-frequency and a change in surface stress at the interface between the polymer and the cantilever surface, which results in a bending of the cantilever. The deflection signal increases owing to the compressive nature of the surface stress change on the functionalized surface of the cantilevers. After the flow of nitrogen gas saturated with analyte has been exchanged for a flow of dry nitrogen gas, the analyte diffused into the polymer layer begins to diffuse out of the polymer into the environment, leading to a decrease of mass on the cantilever: the resonance-frequency increases. Simultaneously, the surface stress at the interface between polymer layer and cantilever is reduced, resulting in a decrease in deflection. Note that the dynamic and static responses do not reach a constant value for all concentrations and that the time constants differ in static and dynamic modes. This is due to the fact that the static response is dominated by stress change at the surface, and the dynamic response results from the diffusion of the analyte within the polymer, simultaneously with a partial dissolution of the polymer.\nThe chemical nature of the polymer layer is responsible for hydrophilicity, polarity and extent of swelling capability of the cantilever coating, producing various types of calibration curves depending on polymer material. Whereas polymers, such as PVA, CMC and PVP strongly absorb water, other polymers such as PU, PS and PMMA are relatively insensitive against water exposure (maximum frequency shifts of typically 10 Hz and maximum deflections of 30 nm). The PVC-coated sensor exhibits a cantilever response in an intermediate range.\nA standard system of analytes is the homologous series of primary alcohols. Based on the findings in the preceeding section, all cantilevers in an array were coated with a PVC polymer layer to reduce the sensitivity against water on the one hand and to provide signals sufficiently large to be measured easily on the other hand. The analyte concentration was set to 90%. Typical cantilever responses measured are shown in Fig. 4 for methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. The largest and fastest cantilever reponses in both dynamic and static mode are observed in methanol, which is the smallest of the analyte molecules investigated. Methanol has the largest vapor pressure among the primary alcohols. The small size of the molecule implies short diffusion times within the polymer. After the experiment, the initial baseline level is reached again, proving the reversibility of the experiment.\nTo study the influence of the analyte concentration on the cantilever responses, we varied the analyte gas flow from 20 to 90 ml/min, in steps of 10 ml/min. The total flow through the analyte chamber was kept constant at a value of 100 ml/min by mixing the analyte gas flow with the corresponding amount of dry nitrogen gas. Fig. 5 shows the dependence on analyte concentration of the cantilever responses in dynamic and static modes for a PVC-coated cantilever. The measurable concentration range depends on the polymer material selected. For example, PMMA allows responses in the dynamic mode to be measured between 10 and 90% analyte. A chart plotting concentration versus maximum frequency shift and concentration versus maximum deflection reveals an increase in the magnitude of cantilever response with concentration (Fig. 6 ). The dependence is linear for the deflection signal, and is strictly monotonous for the resonance-frequency shift signal, but exhibits higher-order terms, such as a parabolic term. Such a deviation from the linear dependence may be interpreted as contributions due to changes in the elastic constants of the cantilever. A decrease in the cantilever spring constant owing to swelling of the polymer layer implies a softening of the coated cantilever. Such an effect would produce the observed increase in frequency shifts at high analyte concentrations.\nThe analyte injection time determines the amount of analyte that is transferred to the cantilever array. If the amount of analyte is too large, the polymer layer might be saturated, and additional analyte will no longer produce an increase in the signal. We varied the injection time of methanol vapor into the analysis chamber from 60 to 200 s in steps of 20 s, using the same cantilever array with PVC coating on all cantilevers as above. As expected, an increase in frequency shift and deflection is observed with increasing injection time (Fig. 7 ). This reflects the mass increase of analyte in the polymer. Whereas in the dynamic mode no saturation is observed, the static cantilever response levels off for longer injection times. As the interface area between cantilever surface and polymer layer is responsible for the static deflection signal, the range of useful injection times is smaller than in the dynamic mode, where the volume of the polymer layer determines the saturation limit.\nIn addition, the headspace volume, i.e. the volume above the liquid in the analyte vial filled with analyte vapor, could influence the cantilever responses. However, no dependence of the cantilever responses in dynamic or static modes was observed by varying the headspace volume by a factor of four. This implies that in all our experiments the headspace volume was sufficiently large to be able to saturate the analyte gas flow with analyte.\nIn contrast to polar analytes, such as primary alcohols and water, alkanes are apolar molecules. This has an impact on the diffusion properties in the polymer. In this subsection, the results on the homologous series of alkanes (hexane to dodecane) using PVC-coated cantilevers are presented. Fig. 8 shows cantilever responses in dynamic and static mode for various alkanes. Interestingly, the maximum frequency shift does not increase in a monotonous way as a function of chain length. Moreover, the cantilever responses in dynamic mode can be divided into two groups of analytes: one group consisting of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms, the other of alkanes having an odd number of carbon atoms. No such separation is observed in static mode. The reason for this can be found in the differing structural and physical properties. Alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms exhibit higher melting points than those with an odd number of carbon atoms. A similar behavior is also found for the boiling points. This implies a slightly larger vapor pressure for alkanes having an odd number of carbon atoms than for those having one carbon atom fewer. Alkanes with a shorter chain produce cantilever responses with larger frequency shift and deflection than alkanes with a longer chain do, as the former have a larger vapor pressure than the latter. This implies that the concentration of heptane is actually higher than that of hexane even though the analyte gas flows are adjusted to the same value (90 ml/min).\nAn example for the characterization of complex analytes is the investigation of perfume oils (Spinnrad GmbH, Gelsenkirchen, Germany). We selected perfume samples with a standardized content of 2.5% perfume oil in ethanol: \u2018Rose\u2019, \u2018Camomile\u2019, \u2018Heliotropin\u2019, \u2018Corps\u2019 and \u2018Leather\u2019. Of perfume oil, 100 \u03bcl was filled into a closed vial. A dry nitrogen gas flow of 80 ml/min was saturated with these analytes. A cantilever array functionalized as displayed in Table 1 was exposed to the analytes for 120 s. Fig. 9 shows all the cantilever responses in the dynamic mode in one graph. The curves were normalized to the magnitude of sensor 3 for later use with neural network techniques. Every measurement produces a new curve, which is the data set for a neural network. Differences between individual perfume oils can be observed when comparing, for example, the responses of sensor 1. We observe that the curves measured are very similar for each of the analytes.\nA feed forward neural network was trained with a set of five curves per analyte using a gradient descent momentum backpropagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate. The topology of the neural net is displayed in Table 3 . The learning curve displaying the mean squared error during validation for the perfume training sets is shown in Fig. 10 (a). The neural net is able to gather information on analytes (training curve) and has the capability to generalize because the mean squared error of the validation curve decreases in an similar way compared as does the training curve. If the neural net is presented one of the 10 validation data sets (which have not been used for training), the neurons in the third layer produce a response. The validation data set shown in Fig. 10(b) acquired on the heliotropin perfume oil produces a neural network response close to one for heliotropin, see Fig. 10(c). This implies that the trained neural network is capable of identifying perfume vapors after presentation of the training sets.\nWe demonstrated the application of micromechanical cantilever arrays as chemical sensors using a setup for the simultaneous detection of resonance-frequency and bending. Information on cantilever bending and resonance-frequency shifts during exposure to analyte vapor can be used for qualitative and quantitative characterization and recognition of a variety of chemical substances, such as water, primary alcohols, and alkanes. Based on the pattern of cantilever responses, the setup can be used for the characterization of complex analytes, such as perfume oils. The discrimination power is greatly enhanced by the use of neural network techniques. Application areas of such sensors are mainly in quality and process control. The application of functionalized cantilever arrays as chemical sensors is only a first step towards a widespread use of micromechanical structures. Recent publications point out the large potential of biochemical applications using micromechanical sensors in liquids for the study of protein adsorption, antibody\u2013antigen recognition, DNA hybridization, and rapid medical diagnostics. Sensing is not the only application of micromechanical structures. By using functionalized nanomechanical membranes as lid, a container could open in presence of drugs to release other substances very locally."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe application of conducting polymers as supports for platinum catalyst particles for the anodic oxidation of hydrogen or small organic molecules has been the subjects of many investigations. The main reason for studying such composite material is the extraordinary electrocatalytic activity, which is comparable with or even exceeds that of bare platinum at relatively low platinum loadings. The character of the composite materials, in particular the size, loadings and distribution of the platinum catalyst particles, the structure of the conducting polymer matrix, as well as the electrocatalytic effect have been studied recently with electrochemical, morphological and spectroscopic approaches, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) , scanning electron microcopy (SEM) , transmission electron microcopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc. As is well known, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can reveal useful information about the interface, its structure and the reactions taking place there. There are two principal approaches to modelling the impedance characteristics of conducting polymers. One assumes a uniform, homogeneous film, the other deals with a porous film . Prasad and Munichandraiah used a.c. impedance methods to study the adsorption and electrooxidation of methanol on polyaniline without dispersed catalyst particles at CH3OH concentrations higher than 1 M . To the knowledge of the present authors, however, little work has been done on the impedance properties of the composite electrodes of platinum-modified polyaniline films and their electrocatalytic effect on oxidation of hydrogen or small molecules. Grzeszczuk and Poks studied the H2 evolution reaction (her) performance of colloidal platinum nanoparticles incorporated in polyaniline by d.c. polarization and a.c. impedance methods . It can be predicted that the modified electrode \u2223 solution interface properties, related to the amount, size and distribution of platinum particles within the polymer matrix, will, no doubt, be of importance to influence the electrocatalytic activity of the platinum-modified polyaniline electrode for methanol oxidation.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to study: (i) the effect of potential polarization modes on the deposition of platinum particles and the relaxation of the polyaniline film; (ii) the electrochemical impedance behavior of both pure polyaniline film and the composite electrodes of platinum-modified polyaniline film; and (iii) the relationship between the electrocatalytic effect of the platinum-modified polyaniline film and the size, amount and distribution of the platinum particles which are characterized by SEM technique.\nAll electrochemical experiments were performed with a CHI650A potentiostat/galvanostat by using a double-compartment glass cell with a three-electrode configuration. The substrate working electrode was a platinum disk encapsulated in epoxy resin and the working surface was the round face of the disk (geometric area: 0.0177 cm2). A platinum sheet was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. All potentials in the paper are presented on the SCE scale. The working electrode was polished mechanically using emery paper (grade 1200\u20131500) to a mirror surface and then cleaned by potential cycling between \u22120.2 and 1.2 V at 50 mV s\u22121 in 0.5 M H2SO4 until a stable voltammogram was obtained.\nThe polyaniline film was formed on the platinum working electrode by the CV technique at 50 mV s\u22121 between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V for 13 cycles in solutions of 0.1 M aniline+0.5 M H2SO4. The film thickness (2.25 \u03bcm) can be calculated by the height of the first anodic peak in the redox process of polyaniline, as reported in Ref. . After preparation, the polyaniline film was (i) treated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with cyclic potential polarization (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V or \u22120.25 to 0.65 V) at 50 mV s\u22121 for 25 cycles, or with constant potential polarization (\u22120.1 or \u22120.25 V) for 900 s; or (ii) modified with platinum particles in 3 mM H2PtCl6+0.5 M H2SO4 solution by cyclic potential polarization (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V or \u22120.25 to 0.65 V) at 50 mV s\u22121 for 25 cycles, or by constant potential polarization (\u22120.1 or \u22120.25 V) for 900 s. Prior to the dispersion of the platinum, the electrode covered with polyaniline film was soaked in the 3 mM H2PtCl6+0.5 M H2SO4 solution for 15 min. The amount of platinum deposited into the polyaniline film can be estimated from measurements of the charge involved during the reduction of Pt4+ to Pt0 .\nEIS measurements for the pure polyaniline film (without deposited platinum particles) and the platinum-modified polyaniline film electrode formed in the abovementioned steps (i) and (ii), respectively, were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under open circuit potential in the a.c. frequency range 100 kHz\u20130.1 Hz with an excitation signal of 5 mV. The real surface area of the dispersed electrode was calculated from the hydrogen adsorption\u2013desorption region in a cyclic voltammogram (CVs) recorded on the platinum electrocatalyst under an N2 atmosphere . Electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol on the platinum-modified polyaniline film was examined in 0.5 M CH3OH+0.5 M H2SO4 solution by a CV technique at 5 mV s\u22121 between \u22120.1 and 0.7 V. All the electrochemical experiments were carried out at 30\u00b11 \u00b0C. The surface morphology of the electrodes was observed by SEM (Model S-570, Hitachi Ltd).\nAniline was purified by distillation with zinc dust and stored under nitrogen gas. All other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. All the solutions were prepared with twice distilled water.\nAs is well known, platinum particles can be dispersed within the conducting polymer film by constant potential or cyclic potential polarization, while the structure and nature of the conducting polymer film will have a significant effect on the deposition of platinum particles. Therefore, the dependence of impedance spectra of the conducting polymer matrix on the potential polarization modes may be considered to study the characteristics of film structures and the kinetics and mechanisms of charge transfer and ion transport in the metal \u2223 polymer film interface and polymer film \u2223 electrolyte interface. After preparation by the CV method in this study, the polyaniline film was polarized by cyclic potential polarization or constant potential polarization in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for film relaxation. Fig. 1 (a and b) shows the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution after the relaxation with the cyclic potential polarization. It can be seen that, although the potential limits are shifted positively from \u22120.25\u20130.65 V to \u22120.1\u20130.8 V, both of the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film display similar characteristics, i.e., a depressed semi-circle in the high frequency region and a straight line with a slope of nearly 45\u00b0 in the low frequency region, which is typical of impedance spectra of polymer film-coated metals in the asymmetric metal/film/electrolyte configuration . As reported earlier, the presence of the depressed semi-circles (i.e. impedance dispersion) in the high frequency region is ascribed to the blocking properties of a rough electrode which render extremely slow the faradaic process of the ionic exchange at the polymer \u2223 electrolyte interface, while the straight line in the low frequency is due to the Warburg diffusion impedance . In spite of the similar shape of the impedance spectra, there is an obvious difference between the diameters of the two semi-circles. That is, the diameter of the semi-circle in Fig. 1(a) is larger than that in Fig. 1(b). In other words, the polyaniline film relaxed with the more negative potential limit (\u22120.25 to 0.65 V) presents a higher electrochemical charge transfer resistance (R ct) than the film relaxed with the more positive potential limit (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V). This agrees with the fact that the polyaniline film which has been polarized more negatively (i.e. in the highly reduced state) usually exhibits lower electronic conductivity, i.e., higher resistance .\nAs a comparison, the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution after the relaxation with the constant potential polarization mode are shown in Fig. 2 (a and b). Obviously, the plot in Fig. 2(b) also contains a semi-circle in the high frequency region and a straight line with slope of nearly 45\u00b0 in the low frequency region, similar to the impedance characteristics of the polyaniline film after the relaxation with cyclic potential polarization mode, as shown in Fig. 1(a and b). However, the plot in Fig. 2(a) shows only about half of a semi-circle in all the frequency regions and no diffusion impedance appears in the low frequency region. In addition, the diameter of the semi-circle in Fig. 2(a) is apparently larger than that in Fig. 2(b). On the other hand, it can be found by comparison that the polyaniline film relaxed with constant potential polarization (Fig. 2) shows a much larger charge transfer resistance (R ct) than the film relaxed with cyclic potential polarization (Fig. 1), which probably indicates the slow charge transfer in the polyaniline film \u2223 H2SO4 solution interface resulting from the constant potential polarization mode.\nInterpretation of EIS measurements is usually done by fitting the experimental impedance spectra to an equivalent electric circuit. That is, an electric circuit combined by some physical elements can be built that has an impedance spectrum identical to that of the electrochemical system under investigation. However, it is often difficult to find an unambiguous physical meaning for particular circuit elements. Moreover, the situation is further complicated in the case of conducting polymers by the different opinions concerning the mode of transport of charge carriers within the polymer film . On the basis of the impedance diagrams we obtained, an equivalent circuit model can be suggested, as is shown in Fig. 3 . In this circuit, R s is the uncompensated solution resistance, R f is interpreted as the film resistance of the polyaniline film (resulting from the penetration of the electrolyte), C f is the capacitance of the polyaniline film, R ct denotes the charge transfer resistance, C dl is the double layer capacitance, and Z d the Warburg diffusion impedance. It should be indicated that the equivalent circuit is more suitable to model the impedance data in Fig. 1(a and b) and Fig. 2(b). As for the impedance data in Fig. 2(a), since there is no clear Warburg impedance in the plot, the element Z d related to the Warburg diffusion impedance should be omitted from the equivalent circuit.\nIn contrast to the pure polyaniline film relaxed with cyclic potential or constant potential polarization without platinum deposition, in the following experiments, the polyaniline film is modified with platinum particles by the same potential polarization modes as used above, i.e., cyclic potential polarization (\u22120.25 to 0.65 V or \u22120.1 to 0.8 V), or constant potential polarization (\u22120.25 or \u22120.1 V). Fig. 4 (a and b) and Fig. 5(a and b) show the impedance spectra of the platinum-modified polyaniline film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. It is seen that the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film modified with platinum particles by cyclic potential (Fig. 4) or constant potential polarization (Fig. 5 ) also exhibit the impedance characteristics of polymer-coated metals in the asymmetric metal/film/electrolyte configuration, i.e., a depressed semi-circle in the high frequency region and a straight line with a slope of nearly 45\u00b0 in the low frequency region, although the semi-circle in Fig. 5(a) seems not to be defined clearly. In comparison with the impedance spectra in Figs. 1 and 2, it is found that the diameters of the semi-circles in Figs. 4 and 5 declines greatly, in particular the semi-circles of polyaniline film modified with platinum by constant potential polarization (Fig. 5). In other words, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of the platinum-modified polyaniline film is much lower than that of the pure polyaniline film with the same potential polarization mode, as is shown in Table 1 . This means that the deposition of platinum particles inside the polyaniline matrix may lead to a faster charge transfer in the parallel polyaniline film \u2223 solution and platinum particles \u2223 solution interface, compared to the charge transfer in the originally single polyaniline film \u2223 solution interface. The reason may be suggested as follows. For the pure polyaniline film in the asymmetric metal/polymer film/electrolyte configuration, there exists only one film \u2223 electrolyte interface which makes a contribution to the double layer capacitance (C dl), as shown in Fig. 3. With the deposition of platinum particles within the polyaniline matrix, a new phase interface, i.e., a platinum particles \u2223 electrolyte interface, will be formed, which will certainly reduce the original interface of polyaniline film \u2223 electrolyte and consequently produce an additional double layer capacitance (C\u2032dl) in parallel with the former double layer capacitance (C dl) related to the polyaniline film \u2223 electrolyte interface. This implies in short that the polyaniline film modified with platinum particles by different modes of potential polarization (e.g. constant potential or cyclic potential polarization) may give rise to very different interfacial structures, perhaps reflecting a different distribution or state of the platinum particles deposited by the two protocols.\nTo explain the different electrocatalytic activity of platinum-modified polyaniline film formed by varying platinum electrodeposition modes (i.e. cyclic potential or constant potential polarization), the characterization of platinum particles, in particular the amount, size, real surface area and distribution within the polymer matrix, is of great significance. As is well known, the platinum specific surface area, calculated from the electrochemically active surface area and the platinum loading, seems to be a useful macroscopic quantity to characterize the size of dispersed catalysts. As a first approach, a simple model consists in assuming homogeneous distributed spherical particles. On the basis of such an assumption, the characteristic particle diameter related to the platinum specific surface area can be calculated . Due to the ideal assumption (i.e. homogeneous distribution and spherical particles) as stated above, usually there are differences between the theoretically calculated size of platinum particles and the real size characterized by TEM observation . Hence, we use the data of platinum loading and the real surface area calculated, respectively, from the coulombic charge of platinum deposition and hydrogen adsorption/desorption. Table 2 gives the relevant information on physical characteristics of the different platinum-modified polyaniline film electrodes formed by varying platinum electrodeposition modes. As can be observed, there exist differences in each physical parameter if the platinum electrodeposition modes are changed. Moreover, even though the same mode of platinum electrodeposition is selected, the physical characteristics of the resulting platinum particles vary, associated with the applied potential limits (in cyclic potential polarization) or selected potentials (in constant potential polarization). It can be thought that the deposition of platinum at highly negative potentials or potential limits may result in the formation of deposits with an increase of amount and a higher active concentration at the surface, thus providing an increase of the apparent current density of methanol oxidation, as discussed later. As a powerful surface physical technique, SEM is used to provide morphological information of both the polyaniline matrix and the dispersed platinum particles, especially their size and distribution. Fig. 6 (a and b) shows SEM micrographs of the surface of the pure polyaniline (without deposited platinum) relaxed with cyclic potential or constant potential polarization. Similarly to the earlier reports , as can be seen, the polyaniline film shows a loose and fibrillar structure, which is typical of a thick polyaniline film. Also there no great difference between the polyaniline film relaxed with cyclic potential or constant potential polarization. Fig. 6(c and d) shows the SEM micrographs of platinum catalyst particles that have been deposited into polyaniline film by cyclic potential (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V) or constant potential (\u22120.25 V) polarization. Based on the previous report , the white spots in the micrographs in Fig. 6(c and d) should be attributed to platinum microcenters. It can be seen, on the one hand, that for the two different electrodeposition modes most of the platinum particles are distributed in an almost homogeneous manner at the surface of the polyaniline film in approximately spherical-like shape with diameters around 0.1\u20130.4 \u03bcm, apart from the localized regions where some platinum particles merge to form a relatively large deposit. On the other hand, it is seen that both the number and size of platinum particles increase with increasing platinum loading, particularly the particle number. Apparently, these surface morphology results of platinum particles are in accordance with the loading and real surface area data as shown in Table 2.\nA strong dependence of the platinum catalytic activity on the catalyst particle structure and its distribution within the matrix of conducting polymers is marked for the oxidation reaction of small molecules. On the basis of the impedance results as stated above, the electrocatalytic activity of platinum-modified polyaniline film electrodes is studied for the oxidation of methanol. The electrocatalytic electrodes are the same as used before to perform the impedance experiments (in Figs. 1, 2, 4 and 5). The CVs of electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol with the electrocatalytic electrodes are shown in Fig. 7 . It is seen that four platinum-modified polyaniline electrodes all exhibit electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation, while the anodic peak current height of methanol oxidation, which appears in the positive going sweeps, changes greatly as a function of the platinum loading of the electrodeposition. As can be seen, the electrocatalytic activity is proportional to the platinum loading determined by the platinum electrodeposition modes (Table 2), which is similar to the earlier reports for methanol oxidation . In other words, larger loading and higher dispersion (i.e. high surface area of active sites) of the deposited platinum particles will be of benefit to the adsorption and oxidation reaction of methanol, corresponding to higher oxidation current densities in Fig. 7. Moreover, the increases of the electrocatalytic activity in Fig. 7 agree well with the impedance characteristics of the corresponding electrodes in Figs. 4 and 5. As indicated earlier in this work, the deposition of platinum into polyaniline film leads to significant decreases of the charge transfer resistance (R ct), compared to the pure polyaniline film. For example, as can be found in Table 1, when the constant potential polarization is changed positively from \u22120.25 to \u22120.1 V, the difference of the charge transfer resistance (R ct) decreases from 49\u2008072 to 12\u2008948 \u03a9. Corresponding to this potential shift, the platinum loading decreases from 261.2 to 131.8 \u03bcg cm\u22122 (Table 2), while the current peak height of methanol oxidation (\u22480.62\u20130.64 V) diminishes from 8.2 to 4.3 mA cm\u22122, as is shown in Fig. 7. Similarly, for the cyclic potential polarization, when the potential limits are changed positively from \u22120.25\u20130.65 V to \u22120.1\u20130.8 V, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) difference between the polyaniline film and platinum-modified polyaniline film decreases from 2343 to 966 \u03a9 (Table 1), the loading diminishes from 222.5 to 112.4 \u03bcg cm\u22122 (Table 2), and the current peak height of methanol oxidation also decreases from 5.9 to 3.2 mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 7). In other words, for a certain potential polarization mode (i.e. constant potential or cyclic potential), the larger the difference between the R ct of pure polyaniline film and the platinum-modified polyaniline film, the greater is the platinum loading and the higher the electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation. Therefore, the relationship between impedance characteristics and electrocatalytic activity can be established.\nFrom the analysis of the experimental data obtained by EIS, SEM and CVs methods, the following important conclusions can be drawn:\n(i) In comparison with the pure polyaniline film \u2223 H2SO4 solution interface, the deposition of platinum into a polyaniline matrix greatly reduces the electrochemical charge transfer resistance (R ct) in the platinum-modified polyaniline film \u2223 H2SO4 solution interface, probably reflecting a remarkable interfacial structure change after the deposition of platinum particles.\n(ii) Both constant potential and cyclic potential polarization can be used to deposit platinum particles into the polyaniline matrix. Moreover, the fixed potentials in constant potential polarization or the potential limits in cyclic potential polarization have great effects on the efficiency of the deposition process and nature of the deposited platinum particles, such as their amount, size and distribution, which can be characterized by SEM observation.\n(iii) The electrocatalytic activity of platinum-modified polyaniline film electrodes for methanol oxidation is connected to the platinum loading and real surface area. Also, the relationship between impedance characteristics and electrocatalytic activity can be established.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

The character of the composite materials, in particular the size, loadings and distribution of the platinum catalyst particles, the structure of the conducting polymer matrix, as well as the electrocatalytic effect have been studied recently with electrochemical, morphological and spectroscopic approaches, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) , scanning electron microcopy (SEM) , transmission electron microcopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc. As is well known, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can reveal useful information about the interface, its structure and the reactions taking place there. There are two principal approaches to modelling the impedance characteristics of conducting polymers. One assumes a uniform, homogeneous film, the other deals with a porous film . Prasad and Munichandraiah used a.c. impedance methods to study the adsorption and electrooxidation of methanol on polyaniline without dispersed catalyst particles at CH3OH concentrations higher than 1 M . To the knowledge of the present authors, however, little work has been done on the impedance properties of the composite electrodes of platinum-modified polyaniline films and their electrocatalytic effect on oxidation of hydrogen or small molecules. Grzeszczuk and Poks studied the H2 evolution reaction (her) performance of colloidal platinum nanoparticles incorporated in polyaniline by d.c. polarization and a.c. impedance methods . It can be predicted that the modified electrode \u2223 solution interface properties, related to the amount, size and distribution of platinum particles within the polymer matrix, will, no doubt, be of importance to influence the electrocatalytic activity of the platinum-modified polyaniline electrode for methanol oxidation.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to study: (i) the effect of potential polarization modes on the deposition of platinum particles and the relaxation of the polyaniline film; (ii) the electrochemical impedance behavior of both pure polyaniline film and the composite electrodes of platinum-modified polyaniline film; and (iii) the relationship between the electrocatalytic effect of the platinum-modified polyaniline film and the size, amount and distribution of the platinum particles which are characterized by SEM technique.\nAll electrochemical experiments were performed with a CHI650A potentiostat/galvanostat by using a double-compartment glass cell with a three-electrode configuration. The substrate working electrode was a platinum disk encapsulated in epoxy resin and the working surface was the round face of the disk (geometric area: 0.0177 cm2). A platinum sheet was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. All potentials in the paper are presented on the SCE scale. The working electrode was polished mechanically using emery paper (grade 1200\u20131500) to a mirror surface and then cleaned by potential cycling between \u22120.2 and 1.2 V at 50 mV s\u22121 in 0.5 M H2SO4 until a stable voltammogram was obtained.\nThe polyaniline film was formed on the platinum working electrode by the CV technique at 50 mV s\u22121 between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V for 13 cycles in solutions of 0.1 M aniline+0.5 M H2SO4. The film thickness (2.25 \u03bcm) can be calculated by the height of the first anodic peak in the redox process of polyaniline, as reported in Ref. . After preparation, the polyaniline film was (i) treated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with cyclic potential polarization (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V or \u22120.25 to 0.65 V) at 50 mV s\u22121 for 25 cycles, or with constant potential polarization (\u22120.1 or \u22120.25 V) for 900 s; or (ii) modified with platinum particles in 3 mM H2PtCl6+0.5 M H2SO4 solution by cyclic potential polarization (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V or \u22120.25 to 0.65 V) at 50 mV s\u22121 for 25 cycles, or by constant potential polarization (\u22120.1 or \u22120.25 V) for 900 s. Prior to the dispersion of the platinum, the electrode covered with polyaniline film was soaked in the 3 mM H2PtCl6+0.5 M H2SO4 solution for 15 min. The amount of platinum deposited into the polyaniline film can be estimated from measurements of the charge involved during the reduction of Pt4+ to Pt0 .\nEIS measurements for the pure polyaniline film (without deposited platinum particles) and the platinum-modified polyaniline film electrode formed in the abovementioned steps (i) and (ii), respectively, were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under open circuit potential in the a.c. frequency range 100 kHz\u20130.1 Hz with an excitation signal of 5 mV. The real surface area of the dispersed electrode was calculated from the hydrogen adsorption\u2013desorption region in a cyclic voltammogram (CVs) recorded on the platinum electrocatalyst under an N2 atmosphere . Electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol on the platinum-modified polyaniline film was examined in 0.5 M CH3OH+0.5 M H2SO4 solution by a CV technique at 5 mV s\u22121 between \u22120.1 and 0.7 V. All the electrochemical experiments were carried out at 30\u00b11 \u00b0C. The surface morphology of the electrodes was observed by SEM (Model S-570, Hitachi Ltd).\nAniline was purified by distillation with zinc dust and stored under nitrogen gas. All other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. All the solutions were prepared with twice distilled water.\nAs is well known, platinum particles can be dispersed within the conducting polymer film by constant potential or cyclic potential polarization, while the structure and nature of the conducting polymer film will have a significant effect on the deposition of platinum particles. Therefore, the dependence of impedance spectra of the conducting polymer matrix on the potential polarization modes may be considered to study the characteristics of film structures and the kinetics and mechanisms of charge transfer and ion transport in the metal \u2223 polymer film interface and polymer film \u2223 electrolyte interface. After preparation by the CV method in this study, the polyaniline film was polarized by cyclic potential polarization or constant potential polarization in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for film relaxation. Fig. 1 (a and b) shows the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution after the relaxation with the cyclic potential polarization. It can be seen that, although the potential limits are shifted positively from \u22120.25\u20130.65 V to \u22120.1\u20130.8 V, both of the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film display similar characteristics, i.e., a depressed semi-circle in the high frequency region and a straight line with a slope of nearly 45\u00b0 in the low frequency region, which is typical of impedance spectra of polymer film-coated metals in the asymmetric metal/film/electrolyte configuration . As reported earlier, the presence of the depressed semi-circles (i.e. impedance dispersion) in the high frequency region is ascribed to the blocking properties of a rough electrode which render extremely slow the faradaic process of the ionic exchange at the polymer \u2223 electrolyte interface, while the straight line in the low frequency is due to the Warburg diffusion impedance . In spite of the similar shape of the impedance spectra, there is an obvious difference between the diameters of the two semi-circles. That is, the diameter of the semi-circle in Fig. 1(a) is larger than that in Fig. 1(b). In other words, the polyaniline film relaxed with the more negative potential limit (\u22120.25 to 0.65 V) presents a higher electrochemical charge transfer resistance (R ct) than the film relaxed with the more positive potential limit (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V). This agrees with the fact that the polyaniline film which has been polarized more negatively (i.e. in the highly reduced state) usually exhibits lower electronic conductivity, i.e., higher resistance .\nAs a comparison, the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution after the relaxation with the constant potential polarization mode are shown in Fig. 2 (a and b). Obviously, the plot in Fig. 2(b) also contains a semi-circle in the high frequency region and a straight line with slope of nearly 45\u00b0 in the low frequency region, similar to the impedance characteristics of the polyaniline film after the relaxation with cyclic potential polarization mode, as shown in Fig. 1(a and b). However, the plot in Fig. 2(a) shows only about half of a semi-circle in all the frequency regions and no diffusion impedance appears in the low frequency region. In addition, the diameter of the semi-circle in Fig. 2(a) is apparently larger than that in Fig. 2(b). On the other hand, it can be found by comparison that the polyaniline film relaxed with constant potential polarization (Fig. 2) shows a much larger charge transfer resistance (R ct) than the film relaxed with cyclic potential polarization (Fig. 1), which probably indicates the slow charge transfer in the polyaniline film \u2223 H2SO4 solution interface resulting from the constant potential polarization mode.\nInterpretation of EIS measurements is usually done by fitting the experimental impedance spectra to an equivalent electric circuit. That is, an electric circuit combined by some physical elements can be built that has an impedance spectrum identical to that of the electrochemical system under investigation. However, it is often difficult to find an unambiguous physical meaning for particular circuit elements. Moreover, the situation is further complicated in the case of conducting polymers by the different opinions concerning the mode of transport of charge carriers within the polymer film . On the basis of the impedance diagrams we obtained, an equivalent circuit model can be suggested, as is shown in Fig. 3 . In this circuit, R s is the uncompensated solution resistance, R f is interpreted as the film resistance of the polyaniline film (resulting from the penetration of the electrolyte), C f is the capacitance of the polyaniline film, R ct denotes the charge transfer resistance, C dl is the double layer capacitance, and Z d the Warburg diffusion impedance. It should be indicated that the equivalent circuit is more suitable to model the impedance data in Fig. 1(a and b) and Fig. 2(b). As for the impedance data in Fig. 2(a), since there is no clear Warburg impedance in the plot, the element Z d related to the Warburg diffusion impedance should be omitted from the equivalent circuit.\nIn contrast to the pure polyaniline film relaxed with cyclic potential or constant potential polarization without platinum deposition, in the following experiments, the polyaniline film is modified with platinum particles by the same potential polarization modes as used above, i.e., cyclic potential polarization (\u22120.25 to 0.65 V or \u22120.1 to 0.8 V), or constant potential polarization (\u22120.25 or \u22120.1 V). Fig. 4 (a and b) and Fig. 5(a and b) show the impedance spectra of the platinum-modified polyaniline film in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. It is seen that the impedance spectra of the polyaniline film modified with platinum particles by cyclic potential (Fig. 4) or constant potential polarization (Fig. 5 ) also exhibit the impedance characteristics of polymer-coated metals in the asymmetric metal/film/electrolyte configuration, i.e., a depressed semi-circle in the high frequency region and a straight line with a slope of nearly 45\u00b0 in the low frequency region, although the semi-circle in Fig. 5(a) seems not to be defined clearly. In comparison with the impedance spectra in Figs. 1 and 2, it is found that the diameters of the semi-circles in Figs. 4 and 5 declines greatly, in particular the semi-circles of polyaniline film modified with platinum by constant potential polarization (Fig. 5). In other words, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of the platinum-modified polyaniline film is much lower than that of the pure polyaniline film with the same potential polarization mode, as is shown in Table 1 . This means that the deposition of platinum particles inside the polyaniline matrix may lead to a faster charge transfer in the parallel polyaniline film \u2223 solution and platinum particles \u2223 solution interface, compared to the charge transfer in the originally single polyaniline film \u2223 solution interface. The reason may be suggested as follows. For the pure polyaniline film in the asymmetric metal/polymer film/electrolyte configuration, there exists only one film \u2223 electrolyte interface which makes a contribution to the double layer capacitance (C dl), as shown in Fig. 3. With the deposition of platinum particles within the polyaniline matrix, a new phase interface, i.e., a platinum particles \u2223 electrolyte interface, will be formed, which will certainly reduce the original interface of polyaniline film \u2223 electrolyte and consequently produce an additional double layer capacitance (C\u2032dl) in parallel with the former double layer capacitance (C dl) related to the polyaniline film \u2223 electrolyte interface. This implies in short that the polyaniline film modified with platinum particles by different modes of potential polarization (e.g. constant potential or cyclic potential polarization) may give rise to very different interfacial structures, perhaps reflecting a different distribution or state of the platinum particles deposited by the two protocols.\nTo explain the different electrocatalytic activity of platinum-modified polyaniline film formed by varying platinum electrodeposition modes (i.e. cyclic potential or constant potential polarization), the characterization of platinum particles, in particular the amount, size, real surface area and distribution within the polymer matrix, is of great significance. As is well known, the platinum specific surface area, calculated from the electrochemically active surface area and the platinum loading, seems to be a useful macroscopic quantity to characterize the size of dispersed catalysts. As a first approach, a simple model consists in assuming homogeneous distributed spherical particles. On the basis of such an assumption, the characteristic particle diameter related to the platinum specific surface area can be calculated . Due to the ideal assumption (i.e. homogeneous distribution and spherical particles) as stated above, usually there are differences between the theoretically calculated size of platinum particles and the real size characterized by TEM observation . Hence, we use the data of platinum loading and the real surface area calculated, respectively, from the coulombic charge of platinum deposition and hydrogen adsorption/desorption. Table 2 gives the relevant information on physical characteristics of the different platinum-modified polyaniline film electrodes formed by varying platinum electrodeposition modes. As can be observed, there exist differences in each physical parameter if the platinum electrodeposition modes are changed. Moreover, even though the same mode of platinum electrodeposition is selected, the physical characteristics of the resulting platinum particles vary, associated with the applied potential limits (in cyclic potential polarization) or selected potentials (in constant potential polarization). It can be thought that the deposition of platinum at highly negative potentials or potential limits may result in the formation of deposits with an increase of amount and a higher active concentration at the surface, thus providing an increase of the apparent current density of methanol oxidation, as discussed later. As a powerful surface physical technique, SEM is used to provide morphological information of both the polyaniline matrix and the dispersed platinum particles, especially their size and distribution. Fig. 6 (a and b) shows SEM micrographs of the surface of the pure polyaniline (without deposited platinum) relaxed with cyclic potential or constant potential polarization. Similarly to the earlier reports , as can be seen, the polyaniline film shows a loose and fibrillar structure, which is typical of a thick polyaniline film. Also there no great difference between the polyaniline film relaxed with cyclic potential or constant potential polarization. Fig. 6(c and d) shows the SEM micrographs of platinum catalyst particles that have been deposited into polyaniline film by cyclic potential (\u22120.1 to 0.8 V) or constant potential (\u22120.25 V) polarization. Based on the previous report , the white spots in the micrographs in Fig. 6(c and d) should be attributed to platinum microcenters. It can be seen, on the one hand, that for the two different electrodeposition modes most of the platinum particles are distributed in an almost homogeneous manner at the surface of the polyaniline film in approximately spherical-like shape with diameters around 0.1\u20130.4 \u03bcm, apart from the localized regions where some platinum particles merge to form a relatively large deposit. On the other hand, it is seen that both the number and size of platinum particles increase with increasing platinum loading, particularly the particle number. Apparently, these surface morphology results of platinum particles are in accordance with the loading and real surface area data as shown in Table 2.\nA strong dependence of the platinum catalytic activity on the catalyst particle structure and its distribution within the matrix of conducting polymers is marked for the oxidation reaction of small molecules. On the basis of the impedance results as stated above, the electrocatalytic activity of platinum-modified polyaniline film electrodes is studied for the oxidation of methanol. The electrocatalytic electrodes are the same as used before to perform the impedance experiments (in Figs. 1, 2, 4 and 5). The CVs of electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol with the electrocatalytic electrodes are shown in Fig. 7 . It is seen that four platinum-modified polyaniline electrodes all exhibit electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation, while the anodic peak current height of methanol oxidation, which appears in the positive going sweeps, changes greatly as a function of the platinum loading of the electrodeposition. As can be seen, the electrocatalytic activity is proportional to the platinum loading determined by the platinum electrodeposition modes (Table 2), which is similar to the earlier reports for methanol oxidation . In other words, larger loading and higher dispersion (i.e. high surface area of active sites) of the deposited platinum particles will be of benefit to the adsorption and oxidation reaction of methanol, corresponding to higher oxidation current densities in Fig. 7. Moreover, the increases of the electrocatalytic activity in Fig. 7 agree well with the impedance characteristics of the corresponding electrodes in Figs. 4 and 5. As indicated earlier in this work, the deposition of platinum into polyaniline film leads to significant decreases of the charge transfer resistance (R ct), compared to the pure polyaniline film. For example, as can be found in Table 1, when the constant potential polarization is changed positively from \u22120.25 to \u22120.1 V, the difference of the charge transfer resistance (R ct) decreases from 49\u2008072 to 12\u2008948 \u03a9. Corresponding to this potential shift, the platinum loading decreases from 261.2 to 131.8 \u03bcg cm\u22122 (Table 2), while the current peak height of methanol oxidation (\u22480.62\u20130.64 V) diminishes from 8.2 to 4.3 mA cm\u22122, as is shown in Fig. 7. Similarly, for the cyclic potential polarization, when the potential limits are changed positively from \u22120.25\u20130.65 V to \u22120.1\u20130.8 V, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) difference between the polyaniline film and platinum-modified polyaniline film decreases from 2343 to 966 \u03a9 (Table 1), the loading diminishes from 222.5 to 112.4 \u03bcg cm\u22122 (Table 2), and the current peak height of methanol oxidation also decreases from 5.9 to 3.2 mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 7). In other words, for a certain potential polarization mode (i.e. constant potential or cyclic potential), the larger the difference between the R ct of pure polyaniline film and the platinum-modified polyaniline film, the greater is the platinum loading and the higher the electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation. Therefore, the relationship between impedance characteristics and electrocatalytic activity can be established.\nFrom the analysis of the experimental data obtained by EIS, SEM and CVs methods, the following important conclusions can be drawn:\n(i) In comparison with the pure polyaniline film \u2223 H2SO4 solution interface, the deposition of platinum into a polyaniline matrix greatly reduces the electrochemical charge transfer resistance (R ct) in the platinum-modified polyaniline film \u2223 H2SO4 solution interface, probably reflecting a remarkable interfacial structure change after the deposition of platinum particles.\n(ii) Both constant potential and cyclic potential polarization can be used to deposit platinum particles into the polyaniline matrix. Moreover, the fixed potentials in constant potential polarization or the potential limits in cyclic potential polarization have great effects on the efficiency of the deposition process and nature of the deposited platinum particles, such as their amount, size and distribution, which can be characterized by SEM observation.\n(iii) The electrocatalytic activity of platinum-modified polyaniline film electrodes for methanol oxidation is connected to the platinum loading and real surface area. Also, the relationship between impedance characteristics and electrocatalytic activity can be established."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nHighly sensitive methods for quantifying nucleic acids are required in many aspects of molecular biology and biotechnology. Electroanalytical techniques have proved very useful for the analysis of DNA and RNA. In particular, the interfacial accumulation and reduction of the nucleobases at mercury electrodes have led to the development of highly sensitive adsorptive stripping voltammetric procedures for trace measurements of DNA and RNA. Analogous stripping measurements of nucleic acids can be performed at carbon-paste or microfabricated carbon-film electrodes by coupling the electrooxidation of the guanine moiety with the surface activity of nucleic acids, and a constant-current potentiometric stripping operation. Such replacement of the classical mercury drop electrode with solid-state electrochemical devices paves the way for increasing the role of electroanalysis in modern DNA diagnostics and nucleic-acid research.\nHere we report on the advantages of using pencil lead (graphite) electrodes for adsorptive stripping measurements of trace DNA and RNA. Pencil electrodes have been used successfully for anodic and abrasive stripping measurements of trace metals, as well as transducers for electrochemical immunosensors. In the following sections we will illustrate that the use of inexpensive pencil electrode materials results in highly sensitive potentiometric stripping measurements of nucleic acids (comparable to the commonly used carbon paste electrode), while offering a convenient surface renewal (through mechanical extrusion of the lead). Such surface renewal is simpler and faster than polishing procedures, common with solid electrodes, and results in good reproducibility for the individual surfaces. Factors influencing trace measurements of DNA and RNA at pencil electrodes are assessed below, and the attractive stripping performance is characterized.\nStripping potentiometric measurements were performed with a PSU 20 potentiometric stripping unit (Radiometer, Westlake, OH, USA), controlled by a PC, using TAP2 software (Radiometer). The electrode system consisted of a pencil lead working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3M NaCl) reference electrode (Model RE-1, BAS) and a platinum wire counter electrode.\nA Pentel pencil, Model P205 (Japan), was used as a holder for the pencil lead. Electrical contact with the lead was achieved by soldering a metallic wire to the metallic part that holds the lead in place inside the pencil. Unless stated otherwise, the pencil was fixed vertically with 6 mm of the pencil lead exposed outside and 3 mm of the pencil lead immersed into the solution. Measurements were performed in a glass cell containing 2 ml of solution. Stirring was achieved with a magnetic stirring bar.\nThe pencil leads tested were from Pentel and named Hi-polymer Super C505 (black lead) of types B, F, HB, H, 4H and 6H. All leads had a total length of 60 mm and a diameter of 0.5 mm. Immersing 3 mm of the pencil lead into a solution resulted in an active electrode area of 4.91 mm2. The pencil leads were used as received.\nThe preparation of the carbon paste disk electrode (2.5 mm diameter) was described earlier.3 The 3 mm diameter glassy carbon disk electrode (BAS) was polished with 0.05 \u03bcm alumina. All pipette tips and tubes for preparation of solutions were autoclaved prior to use.\nThe following chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA): transfer RNA (tRNA, from baker\u2019s yeast; catalog number R8759), single stranded DNA (ssDNA; catalog number D8899), sodium acetate buffer solution (3M), Tris-EDTA buffer (1.0 M Tris HCl\u20130.10M EDTA) and diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). Oligo(dG)20 was obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). The preparation of the tRNA stock solutions (1000 mg l\u22121) was described earlier. Stock solutions (1000 mg l\u22121) of ssDNA and oligo(dG)20 were prepared in a 10 mM Tris HCl\u20131 mM EDTA solution (pH 8.0). Other solutions were prepared in acetate buffer (0.2M, pH 5.0). All solutions were prepared using deionized and autoclaved water.\nUnless mentioned otherwise, all measurements were performed by treating the surface at +1.40 V for 30s followed by accumulation at +0.50 V for 60s in a stirred acetate buffer solution (0.2 M, pH 5.0). The stripping step was carried out without stirring, after a 5s rest period, using a constant current of +5.0 \u03bcA. Each measurement was performed using a new pencil surface. The carbon paste and glassy carbon surfaces were polished prior to every measurement. Before evaluation, the stripping curve data were treated using the baseline-correction and filter commands of the TAP2 software.\nAnodic measurements of trace nucleic acids are based primarily on measurements of the oxidation peak of the guanine residue.Fig. 1 compares adsorptive stripping potentiograms for tRNA at the pencil (a), carbon-paste (b), and glassy-carbon (c) electrodes, following a 1 min adsorptive collection. Examination of the raw data (A, top) indicates that the pencil electrode results in a larger guanine peak, as well as solvent decomposition background, than the commonly used carbon paste electrode. A poorly defined peak, obscured by the background response, is observed at the glassy carbon electrode. The background contribution is corrected following the advanced data processing inherent to the computerized stripping potentiometric operation (B, bottom). As a result, the pencil electrode offers the most favorable detection of the tRNA guanine peak (Ep= +0.96 V). Note the appearance of an additional small peak, at both carbon paste and pencil electrodes (Ep= +1.10 V). A similar peak, observed for oligo(dG)20 (not shown), indicates that this is not an adenine response. Besides its favorable response characteristics, the pencil electrode offers a unique surface renewal (in connection with mechanical extrusion of the pencil lead), low cost, and rigidity. Such surface renewal is actually the closest solid-electrode analogue of mercury drop electrodes.\nWe screened different types of pencil leads for their stripping response to nucleic acids. Fig. 2 compares stripping chronopotentiograms for 2 \u03bcg l\u22121 tRNA, following 1 min accumulation, using six different pencil leads. Substantial differences in the stripping response and background signal are observed at the various types of pencil leads, with the HB one (a) displaying the most favorable signal-to-background characteristics. The F and H leads display a large guanine peak, along with a large background contribution (c,d). Lower backgrounds, and guanine signals, are observed with the B, 4H, and 6H leads (b,e and f, respectively). Such different response characteristics are expected considering the different compositions and roughness of the various leads (that contain various polymers and clays, besides graphite). Blank experiments (not shown) indicate that these non-graphite constituents do not yield a background peak. In view of the composite nature of the leads, and the complexity of the processes involved, it is not clear, at this stage, whether the different response characteristics reflect differences in the interfacial (adsorption) properties of the nucleic acids, in the kinetics of the guanine oxidation process, or in the effective surface area (roughness). Larger guanine signals, coupled to a large background (F and H leads), may indicate both a reactive graphite surface and a graphite-rich one. The HB pencil lead is advantageous as it offers a relatively large guanine peak in connection with a relatively low background signal and noise level (a). Different ferrocyanide voltammetric signals (and background profiles) were observed previously using different pencil leads. The HB pencil lead was found to be an excellent electrode in anodic and cathodic stripping voltammetric measurements of trace metals. Based on the profiles of Fig. 2, this lead was selected also for all subsequent DNA and RNA work.\nAs is common for trace measurements of nucleic acids at other carbon electrodes, a short electrochemical activation is essential for obtaining favorable stripping signals. Fig. 3A shows the effect of the pretreatment potential on the response to 1 mg l\u22121 of tRNA. The guanine signal increases slowly upon changing the potential between +1.0 and +1.2 V, rises sharply between +1.2 and +1.5 V, and then levels off. A pretreatment potential of +1.4 V yielded the best tradeoff between sensitivity, background contribution, and corresponding noise, and was thus used for all subsequent work. A large noise level was observed without the electrochemical activation. The effect of the accumulation time is displayed in Fig. 3B. The response of tRNA increases rapidly upon raising the pretreatment time between 15 s and 3 min, than more slowly (up to 8 min), and subsequently more rapidly.\nThe pencil lead can be extruded to different lengths, to yield different surface areas. As expected, the length of the pencil lead (exposed to the sample) has a profound effect upon the response. The stripping signal for 1 mg l\u22121 tRNA increased linearly with the length over the 1\u20138 mm range (slope, 40 ms mm\u22121; correlation coefficient, 0.991; not shown; conditions, as in Fig. 1a). Due to a corresponding increase in the background, all subsequent work employed 3-mm pencil leads (with an active area of 4.91mm2). Of particular importance for renewable graphite electrodes is the surface-to-surface reproducibility. A series of 14 repetitive measurements of 1 mg l\u22121 ssDNA, using newly exposed leads, yielded a mean signal of 28.1 ms, with a relative standard deviation of 6.4% (conditions as in Fig. 1a). Note that such renewable graphite electrodes can be reproducibly used as received.\nThe optimal conditions offer convenient quantitation of mg l\u22121 concentrations of nucleic acids following short adsorption times. Fig. 4 displays calibration plots for oligo(dG)20 (A) and ssDNA (B) using a 1 min accumulation. These plots display a curvature characteristic of adsorptive stripping measurements. The peak of the shorter oligonucleotide increases rapidly with the concentration at first and starts to level off above 1 mg l\u22121. The response for ssDNA increases nearly linearly up to 2 mg l\u22121, with a curvature thereafter. Lower concentrations can be readily detected in combination with longer accumulation periods. For example, a detection limit of 3 \u03bcg l\u22121 tRNA was estimated based on the signal-to-noise characteristics (S/N=3) of the response for 10 \u03bcg l\u22121 tRNA following a 10 min adsorption (not shown).\nIn conclusion, the pencil electrode has been demonstrated to be an excellent electrode material for adsorptive stripping measurements of trace nucleic acids. Such suitability is attributed to the composite (mixed graphite\u2013insulator) character of pencil leads, which is analogous to that of other composite carbons used for the analysis of nucleic acids. While offering very favorable signal-to-background characteristics, the main advantage of the pencil DNA electrode appears to be its readily renewable surface. Other bioanalytical applications should benefit from the facile detection of nucleic acids at pencil electrodes. For example, the strong adsorptive accumulation of DNA could lead to renewable, low-cost, DNA modified electrodes for detecting DNA hybridization (with the mechanical extrusion obviating the need for regenerating the ssDNA probe). Similarly, the well-defined guanine response should offer convenient flow detection of nucleic acids following HPLC or CZE separations. The later should address the selectivity challenge expected in assays of biological samples. Alternatively, potential interferences could be minimized in connection with a proper sample pretreatment (e.g., extraction, PCR amplification).\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Highly sensitive methods for quantifying nucleic acids are required in many aspects of molecular biology and biotechnology. Electroanalytical techniques have proved very useful for the analysis of DNA and RNA. In particular, the interfacial accumulation and reduction of the nucleobases at mercury electrodes have led to the development of highly sensitive adsorptive stripping voltammetric procedures for trace measurements of DNA and RNA. Analogous stripping measurements of nucleic acids can be performed at carbon-paste or microfabricated carbon-film electrodes by coupling the electrooxidation of the guanine moiety with the surface activity of nucleic acids, and a constant-current potentiometric stripping operation. Such replacement of the classical mercury drop electrode with solid-state electrochemical devices paves the way for increasing the role of electroanalysis in modern DNA diagnostics and nucleic-acid research.\nHere we report on the advantages of using pencil lead (graphite) electrodes for adsorptive stripping measurements of trace DNA and RNA. Pencil electrodes have been used successfully for anodic and abrasive stripping measurements of trace metals, as well as transducers for electrochemical immunosensors. In the following sections we will illustrate that the use of inexpensive pencil electrode materials results in highly sensitive potentiometric stripping measurements of nucleic acids (comparable to the commonly used carbon paste electrode), while offering a convenient surface renewal (through mechanical extrusion of the lead). Such surface renewal is simpler and faster than polishing procedures, common with solid electrodes, and results in good reproducibility for the individual surfaces. Factors influencing trace measurements of DNA and RNA at pencil electrodes are assessed below, and the attractive stripping performance is characterized.\nStripping potentiometric measurements were performed with a PSU 20 potentiometric stripping unit (Radiometer, Westlake, OH, USA), controlled by a PC, using TAP2 software (Radiometer). The electrode system consisted of a pencil lead working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3M NaCl) reference electrode (Model RE-1, BAS) and a platinum wire counter electrode.\nA Pentel pencil, Model P205 (Japan), was used as a holder for the pencil lead. Electrical contact with the lead was achieved by soldering a metallic wire to the metallic part that holds the lead in place inside the pencil. Unless stated otherwise, the pencil was fixed vertically with 6 mm of the pencil lead exposed outside and 3 mm of the pencil lead immersed into the solution. Measurements were performed in a glass cell containing 2 ml of solution. Stirring was achieved with a magnetic stirring bar.\nThe pencil leads tested were from Pentel and named Hi-polymer Super C505 (black lead) of types B, F, HB, H, 4H and 6H. All leads had a total length of 60 mm and a diameter of 0.5 mm. Immersing 3 mm of the pencil lead into a solution resulted in an active electrode area of 4.91 mm2. The pencil leads were used as received.\nThe preparation of the carbon paste disk electrode (2.5 mm diameter) was described earlier.3 The 3 mm diameter glassy carbon disk electrode (BAS) was polished with 0.05 \u03bcm alumina. All pipette tips and tubes for preparation of solutions were autoclaved prior to use.\nThe following chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA): transfer RNA (tRNA, from baker\u2019s yeast; catalog number R8759), single stranded DNA (ssDNA; catalog number D8899), sodium acetate buffer solution (3M), Tris-EDTA buffer (1.0 M Tris HCl\u20130.10M EDTA) and diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). Oligo(dG)20 was obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). The preparation of the tRNA stock solutions (1000 mg l\u22121) was described earlier. Stock solutions (1000 mg l\u22121) of ssDNA and oligo(dG)20 were prepared in a 10 mM Tris HCl\u20131 mM EDTA solution (pH 8.0). Other solutions were prepared in acetate buffer (0.2M, pH 5.0). All solutions were prepared using deionized and autoclaved water.\nUnless mentioned otherwise, all measurements were performed by treating the surface at +1.40 V for 30s followed by accumulation at +0.50 V for 60s in a stirred acetate buffer solution (0.2 M, pH 5.0). The stripping step was carried out without stirring, after a 5s rest period, using a constant current of +5.0 \u03bcA. Each measurement was performed using a new pencil surface. The carbon paste and glassy carbon surfaces were polished prior to every measurement. Before evaluation, the stripping curve data were treated using the baseline-correction and filter commands of the TAP2 software.\nAnodic measurements of trace nucleic acids are based primarily on measurements of the oxidation peak of the guanine residue.Fig. 1 compares adsorptive stripping potentiograms for tRNA at the pencil (a), carbon-paste (b), and glassy-carbon (c) electrodes, following a 1 min adsorptive collection. Examination of the raw data (A, top) indicates that the pencil electrode results in a larger guanine peak, as well as solvent decomposition background, than the commonly used carbon paste electrode. A poorly defined peak, obscured by the background response, is observed at the glassy carbon electrode. The background contribution is corrected following the advanced data processing inherent to the computerized stripping potentiometric operation (B, bottom). As a result, the pencil electrode offers the most favorable detection of the tRNA guanine peak (Ep= +0.96 V). Note the appearance of an additional small peak, at both carbon paste and pencil electrodes (Ep= +1.10 V). A similar peak, observed for oligo(dG)20 (not shown), indicates that this is not an adenine response. Besides its favorable response characteristics, the pencil electrode offers a unique surface renewal (in connection with mechanical extrusion of the pencil lead), low cost, and rigidity. Such surface renewal is actually the closest solid-electrode analogue of mercury drop electrodes.\nWe screened different types of pencil leads for their stripping response to nucleic acids. Fig. 2 compares stripping chronopotentiograms for 2 \u03bcg l\u22121 tRNA, following 1 min accumulation, using six different pencil leads. Substantial differences in the stripping response and background signal are observed at the various types of pencil leads, with the HB one (a) displaying the most favorable signal-to-background characteristics. The F and H leads display a large guanine peak, along with a large background contribution (c,d). Lower backgrounds, and guanine signals, are observed with the B, 4H, and 6H leads (b,e and f, respectively). Such different response characteristics are expected considering the different compositions and roughness of the various leads (that contain various polymers and clays, besides graphite). Blank experiments (not shown) indicate that these non-graphite constituents do not yield a background peak. In view of the composite nature of the leads, and the complexity of the processes involved, it is not clear, at this stage, whether the different response characteristics reflect differences in the interfacial (adsorption) properties of the nucleic acids, in the kinetics of the guanine oxidation process, or in the effective surface area (roughness). Larger guanine signals, coupled to a large background (F and H leads), may indicate both a reactive graphite surface and a graphite-rich one. The HB pencil lead is advantageous as it offers a relatively large guanine peak in connection with a relatively low background signal and noise level (a). Different ferrocyanide voltammetric signals (and background profiles) were observed previously using different pencil leads. The HB pencil lead was found to be an excellent electrode in anodic and cathodic stripping voltammetric measurements of trace metals. Based on the profiles of Fig. 2, this lead was selected also for all subsequent DNA and RNA work.\nAs is common for trace measurements of nucleic acids at other carbon electrodes, a short electrochemical activation is essential for obtaining favorable stripping signals. Fig. 3A shows the effect of the pretreatment potential on the response to 1 mg l\u22121 of tRNA. The guanine signal increases slowly upon changing the potential between +1.0 and +1.2 V, rises sharply between +1.2 and +1.5 V, and then levels off. A pretreatment potential of +1.4 V yielded the best tradeoff between sensitivity, background contribution, and corresponding noise, and was thus used for all subsequent work. A large noise level was observed without the electrochemical activation. The effect of the accumulation time is displayed in Fig. 3B. The response of tRNA increases rapidly upon raising the pretreatment time between 15 s and 3 min, than more slowly (up to 8 min), and subsequently more rapidly.\nThe pencil lead can be extruded to different lengths, to yield different surface areas. As expected, the length of the pencil lead (exposed to the sample) has a profound effect upon the response. The stripping signal for 1 mg l\u22121 tRNA increased linearly with the length over the 1\u20138 mm range (slope, 40 ms mm\u22121; correlation coefficient, 0.991; not shown; conditions, as in Fig. 1a). Due to a corresponding increase in the background, all subsequent work employed 3-mm pencil leads (with an active area of 4.91mm2). Of particular importance for renewable graphite electrodes is the surface-to-surface reproducibility. A series of 14 repetitive measurements of 1 mg l\u22121 ssDNA, using newly exposed leads, yielded a mean signal of 28.1 ms, with a relative standard deviation of 6.4% (conditions as in Fig. 1a). Note that such renewable graphite electrodes can be reproducibly used as received.\nThe optimal conditions offer convenient quantitation of mg l\u22121 concentrations of nucleic acids following short adsorption times. Fig. 4 displays calibration plots for oligo(dG)20 (A) and ssDNA (B) using a 1 min accumulation. These plots display a curvature characteristic of adsorptive stripping measurements. The peak of the shorter oligonucleotide increases rapidly with the concentration at first and starts to level off above 1 mg l\u22121. The response for ssDNA increases nearly linearly up to 2 mg l\u22121, with a curvature thereafter. Lower concentrations can be readily detected in combination with longer accumulation periods. For example, a detection limit of 3 \u03bcg l\u22121 tRNA was estimated based on the signal-to-noise characteristics (S/N=3) of the response for 10 \u03bcg l\u22121 tRNA following a 10 min adsorption (not shown).\nIn conclusion, the pencil electrode has been demonstrated to be an excellent electrode material for adsorptive stripping measurements of trace nucleic acids. Such suitability is attributed to the composite (mixed graphite\u2013insulator) character of pencil leads, which is analogous to that of other composite carbons used for the analysis of nucleic acids. While offering very favorable signal-to-background characteristics, the main advantage of the pencil DNA electrode appears to be its readily renewable surface. Other bioanalytical applications should benefit from the facile detection of nucleic acids at pencil electrodes. For example, the strong adsorptive accumulation of DNA could lead to renewable, low-cost, DNA modified electrodes for detecting DNA hybridization (with the mechanical extrusion obviating the need for regenerating the ssDNA probe). Similarly, the well-defined guanine response should offer convenient flow detection of nucleic acids following HPLC or CZE separations. The later should address the selectivity challenge expected in assays of biological samples. Alternatively, potential interferences could be minimized in connection with a proper sample pretreatment (e.g., extraction, PCR amplification)."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nVegetable materials are often used as bio-indicators for establishing the degree of pollution related to chemicals in the environment. Analysis for the content of bio and toxic elements is also carried out to diagnose abnormal plant development .\nIn analytical procedures involving elimination of the organic matrix, the chemical sample pre-treatment is frequently considered the \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 of the analytical process , mainly due to time consumption.\nFor the preparation of vegetable samples, dry ashing or wet digestion methods are commonly used . In general, classical wet-digestion procedures (in open systems) entail tedious and laborious steps, and possible analyte losses and/or sample contamination . In addition, dry ashing methods are sometimes discouraged due to possible losses of volatile elements, analyte reactions with the crucible material, difficulties involving dissolution of the combustion residue, and problems such as sample contamination .\nIn view of these problems, some other procedures for vegetable sample preparation have been proposed . Procedures involving microwave ovens are often employed for sample digestion . Although microwave ovens are an excellent alternative for sample preparation, this equipment is often quite expensive and is limited for routine applications .\nUltrasound can be considered another alternative for solid sample pre-treatment because, this energy facilitates and accelerates some steps, such as dissolution, fusion and leaching, among others . Ultrasonic effects have been exploited for sample preparation in agricultural, biological and environmental applications .\nThe chemical effects of ultrasound have been attributed to cavitation, generating local high temperatures and to mechanical action between solid and liquid interfaces . In this way, the efficiency of analyte extraction depends on the variables that influence the cavitation process (temperature, viscosity, presence of solid particles, height of water column, frequency, and position of the vessels used for extraction, among others) . However, as long as experimental conditions are constant, the ultrasonic device is an excellent way to perform solid\u2013liquid extraction .\nThe aim of this work was to improve sample preparation performance, proposing the development of an ultrasound-assisted method for fast and reproducible acid extraction of some macro- and micronutrients in vegetable samples and their determination by FAAS.\nA Neytech model 28H ultrasonic bath (USA) at a frequency of 47\u00b13 kHz was used. A peristaltic pump (Ismatec IPC, Glattburg, Switzerland) was used to change the water during sonication. A Marconi model MA 4025 heating block (Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) was employed for wet digestion.\nFor determination of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn, a Perkin-Elmer model AAnalyst 300, flame atomic absorption spectrometer, equipped with a deuterium lamp background-correction system (Norwalk, CT, USA) was used throughout this work. Hollow cathode lamps (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) of the different metals were used as the radiation sources and the analytical measurements were based on time-averaged absorbances. The FAAS operating conditions are summarised in Table 1 .\nAll solutions were prepared with analytical reagent-grade chemicals (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and de-ionised water was used throughout.\nWorking standard solutions of Ca (1.0\u20134.0 mg l\u22121) [from CaCO3], Mg (0.2\u20130.5 mg l\u22121), Zn (0.25\u20131.00 mg l\u22121), Mn (0.5\u20132.5 mg l\u22121) and Fe (1.0\u20136.0 mg l\u22121) [in their metallic forms] were prepared by sequential dilutions from stock solutions of 100 mg l\u22121. For Ca and Mg standard solutions, LaCl3 was used as a concomitant suppresser at a final concentration of 1% w/v.\nTwo different vegetable materials were used for optimisation of extraction conditions: lettuce and cabbage leaves collected from kitchen gardens in the Campinas neighbourhood. Due to the importance of the method for metal extraction, a medicinal plant (Equisetum pyramidale) was also employed. The accuracy was assessed using all kinds of samples. The samples were cleaned with de-ionised water and dried to constant mass in an oven at 60\u00b15\u00b0C. After drying, the samples were ground in a food processor and sieved to a 150\u201363 \u03bcm particle size range.\nAccuracy was also evaluated using two reference materials: apple leaves (NIST SRM 1515) and spinach (NIST SRM 1570a). These reference materials were prepared according to the instructions provided on the information sheet.\nTo improve the sonochemical effects, a study was carried out with the ultrasonic bath. The iodine method was used, with the I2 formed measured at 352 nm with a spectrophotometer. The I2 was formed from KI solution by a radicalar reaction and redox reaction with the H2O2 formed in water sonication. The highest amount of I2 formed reflects the highest cavitation process .\nThe parameters optimised were water volume (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 l) and temperature (25, 30 and 35\u00b0C); detergent concentration (0, 0.2 and 0.4% w/v); and horizontal (nine tubes positioned equidistant in the bath) and vertical (0, 1.0 and 2.0 cm from the bottom of the bath) positions of the tube in the bath. After optimisation, the best conditions for cavitation were used in the extraction method.\nThe extraction of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn from lettuce and cabbage leaves was performed in the ultrasonic bath. For acid-extraction optimisation, different nitric acid concentrations (0, 0.14 and 1.4 mol l\u22121) and sonication times (0, 10, 20 and 30 min) were tested. A study related to particle size was also performed, using only the cabbage samples, by varying the particles from 63 to 150 \u03bcm. To evaluate the efficiency of the process, the results obtained with the extraction method were compared with those from wet digestion.\nAn accurately weighed sample of 0.3 g \u00b10.1 mg was transferred to each digestion tube for ultrasound extraction, 15 ml of the extractor was added and the tubes were placed in the Neytech ultrasonic bath. After sonication, the samples were filtered; the liquid phase was collected in polyethylene flasks for measurement, which was performed by FAAS. The measurements were performed only in the liquid phase in order to avoid possible blockage in the capillary of the FAAS equipment.\nTo evaluate the fast extraction method, the results obtained with this method were compared with those for wet digestion using HNO3 and H2O2 as the digestion mixture.\nThe best conditions for the cavitation process were obtained through the iodine method (as already commented in Section 2.4.1). Using the optimised conditions shown in Table 2 , a better cavitation process was achieved.\nThe water volume is one of principal factors for obtaining good results in ultrasonic applications. Thus, a volume of 1000 ml was used because it produces good performance in the extraction procedures. Using other volumes gave worse results for the iodine method.\nIt is interesting to note that better cavitation effects were observed when only one tube was sonicated, producing higher absorbances from the KI reaction. In this sense, the central position with the tube positioned 0 cm from the bottom of bath was determined as the best position for a higher cavitation process.\nThe temperature was chosen because it was possible to work in the environmental temperature, and higher temperatures did not improve the cavitation process.\nConcentrations of detergent higher than 0.2% (w/v) were not used, due to an increase in solid particles in the liquid phase of the ultrasonic bath, which diminished the ultrasound propagation. The 0.2% concentration gave the best conditions for cavitation.\nIn order to select the optimum conditions for extraction, two different vegetables were studied: lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea capitata). The Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn extractions were evaluated by varying the acid concentration and the sonication time.\nThe extraction of the elements studied was checked by comparing the proposed fast extraction method with the wet digestion method .\nThe results obtained in the optimisation are shown in Fig. 1 . Both parameters studied (acid concentration and sonication time) have an influence on the extraction efficiency, although the effect of acid concentration is more pronounced. These results are similar to those obtained for Pb extraction in different samples using an ultrasonic probe and bath . Fig. 1 shows that incomplete extraction occurs when only water is used, indicating the necessity of acid as an extractor for Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn. However, the extractions are quite similar when the acid concentration was varied from 0.14 to 1.4 mol l\u22121, since only slight variations (ca. 3%) were obtained for all the elements studied.\nSonication improved the extraction process. Quantitative extractions were obtained after 10 or 20 min of sonication time and were dependent on the metal studied. When a time of 30 min was used, lower extractions were obtained (Fig. 1). As different species can be formed during sonication, it is possible that a longer sonication time provokes the re-combination of different structures in the liquid, forming new species and reducing ions in the liquid phase .\nUsing 0.14 mol l\u22121 nitric acid and 10 min for the sonication time, better conditions for extraction were achieved for the elements studied, except for iron in lettuce, which produced lower recoveries compared to those with wet digestion. This may be due to depression of the Fe response in the presence of organic acids . The use of 1.4 mol l\u22121 HNO3 results in better recoveries for iron. This can be explained by the higher concentration of HNO3 used. Sometimes the use of an acid mixture or of oxidising agents is an effective way for obtaining complete extraction of iron .\nExcept for iron, it is interesting to note that the extraction efficiency for the other metals was similar for lettuce and cabbage samples extracted with only 0.14 mol l\u22121 nitric acid.\nUsing the cabbage samples, a study of particle size was performed, where this parameter was varied from 63 to 150 \u03bcm, with the samples being sonicated for 10 min.\nThe particle size was an important factor for Ca, Fe, Mn and Zn extraction, where recoveries of ca. 100% were obtained with <75 \u03bcm particle size. This was confirmed by applying the t-test at a 95% confidence level to the results obtained with wet digestion, also using the same particle sizes. This test was performed because different results could be produced due to the natural distribution of the metal in the different particle sizes . In this way, the <75 \u03bcm particle size was chosen for evaluation of the accuracy.\nThe accuracy of ultrasonic extraction for the proposed method was determined by comparing the results with those obtained using a different digestion method for lettuce, cabbage and a medicinal plant (Equisetum pyramidale), as well as by analysing different CRM materials, such as spinach (NIST 1570a) and apple leaves (NIST 1515). The results, presented in Table 3 , show that no statistical differences were observed at the 95% confidence level, indicating that the fast extraction method with sonication is applicable for this type of sample, opening the possibility of its application for other samples.\nThe results for iron are not shown, since its recovery (ca. 98%) was only acceptable for cabbage (see Fig. 1).\nThe proposed method permitted a fast, easy and inexpensive extraction of Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn in different plant materials, and in some instances for Fe.\nAll parameters studied (acid concentration, sonication time and particle size) influence the extraction efficiency. The results obtained with this method and with wet digestion were similar, allowing the substitution of hazardous and/or problematic handling methods for routine analyses in environmental or agronomic studies.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Vegetable materials are often used as bio-indicators for establishing the degree of pollution related to chemicals in the environment. Analysis for the content of bio and toxic elements is also carried out to diagnose abnormal plant development .\nIn analytical procedures involving elimination of the organic matrix, the chemical sample pre-treatment is frequently considered the \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 of the analytical process , mainly due to time consumption.\nFor the preparation of vegetable samples, dry ashing or wet digestion methods are commonly used . In general, classical wet-digestion procedures (in open systems) entail tedious and laborious steps, and possible analyte losses and/or sample contamination . In addition, dry ashing methods are sometimes discouraged due to possible losses of volatile elements, analyte reactions with the crucible material, difficulties involving dissolution of the combustion residue, and problems such as sample contamination .\nIn view of these problems, some other procedures for vegetable sample preparation have been proposed . Procedures involving microwave ovens are often employed for sample digestion . Although microwave ovens are an excellent alternative for sample preparation, this equipment is often quite expensive and is limited for routine applications .\nUltrasound can be considered another alternative for solid sample pre-treatment because, this energy facilitates and accelerates some steps, such as dissolution, fusion and leaching, among others . Ultrasonic effects have been exploited for sample preparation in agricultural, biological and environmental applications .\nThe chemical effects of ultrasound have been attributed to cavitation, generating local high temperatures and to mechanical action between solid and liquid interfaces . In this way, the efficiency of analyte extraction depends on the variables that influence the cavitation process (temperature, viscosity, presence of solid particles, height of water column, frequency, and position of the vessels used for extraction, among others) . However, as long as experimental conditions are constant, the ultrasonic device is an excellent way to perform solid\u2013liquid extraction .\nThe aim of this work was to improve sample preparation performance, proposing the development of an ultrasound-assisted method for fast and reproducible acid extraction of some macro- and micronutrients in vegetable samples and their determination by FAAS.\nA Neytech model 28H ultrasonic bath (USA) at a frequency of 47\u00b13 kHz was used. A peristaltic pump (Ismatec IPC, Glattburg, Switzerland) was used to change the water during sonication. A Marconi model MA 4025 heating block (Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) was employed for wet digestion.\nFor determination of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn, a Perkin-Elmer model AAnalyst 300, flame atomic absorption spectrometer, equipped with a deuterium lamp background-correction system (Norwalk, CT, USA) was used throughout this work. Hollow cathode lamps (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) of the different metals were used as the radiation sources and the analytical measurements were based on time-averaged absorbances. The FAAS operating conditions are summarised in Table 1 .\nAll solutions were prepared with analytical reagent-grade chemicals (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and de-ionised water was used throughout.\nWorking standard solutions of Ca (1.0\u20134.0 mg l\u22121) [from CaCO3], Mg (0.2\u20130.5 mg l\u22121), Zn (0.25\u20131.00 mg l\u22121), Mn (0.5\u20132.5 mg l\u22121) and Fe (1.0\u20136.0 mg l\u22121) [in their metallic forms] were prepared by sequential dilutions from stock solutions of 100 mg l\u22121. For Ca and Mg standard solutions, LaCl3 was used as a concomitant suppresser at a final concentration of 1% w/v.\nTwo different vegetable materials were used for optimisation of extraction conditions: lettuce and cabbage leaves collected from kitchen gardens in the Campinas neighbourhood. Due to the importance of the method for metal extraction, a medicinal plant (Equisetum pyramidale) was also employed. The accuracy was assessed using all kinds of samples. The samples were cleaned with de-ionised water and dried to constant mass in an oven at 60\u00b15\u00b0C. After drying, the samples were ground in a food processor and sieved to a 150\u201363 \u03bcm particle size range.\nAccuracy was also evaluated using two reference materials: apple leaves (NIST SRM 1515) and spinach (NIST SRM 1570a). These reference materials were prepared according to the instructions provided on the information sheet.\nTo improve the sonochemical effects, a study was carried out with the ultrasonic bath. The iodine method was used, with the I2 formed measured at 352 nm with a spectrophotometer. The I2 was formed from KI solution by a radicalar reaction and redox reaction with the H2O2 formed in water sonication. The highest amount of I2 formed reflects the highest cavitation process .\nThe parameters optimised were water volume (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 l) and temperature (25, 30 and 35\u00b0C); detergent concentration (0, 0.2 and 0.4% w/v); and horizontal (nine tubes positioned equidistant in the bath) and vertical (0, 1.0 and 2.0 cm from the bottom of the bath) positions of the tube in the bath. After optimisation, the best conditions for cavitation were used in the extraction method.\nThe extraction of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn from lettuce and cabbage leaves was performed in the ultrasonic bath. For acid-extraction optimisation, different nitric acid concentrations (0, 0.14 and 1.4 mol l\u22121) and sonication times (0, 10, 20 and 30 min) were tested. A study related to particle size was also performed, using only the cabbage samples, by varying the particles from 63 to 150 \u03bcm. To evaluate the efficiency of the process, the results obtained with the extraction method were compared with those from wet digestion.\nAn accurately weighed sample of 0.3 g \u00b10.1 mg was transferred to each digestion tube for ultrasound extraction, 15 ml of the extractor was added and the tubes were placed in the Neytech ultrasonic bath. After sonication, the samples were filtered; the liquid phase was collected in polyethylene flasks for measurement, which was performed by FAAS. The measurements were performed only in the liquid phase in order to avoid possible blockage in the capillary of the FAAS equipment.\nTo evaluate the fast extraction method, the results obtained with this method were compared with those for wet digestion using HNO3 and H2O2 as the digestion mixture.\nThe best conditions for the cavitation process were obtained through the iodine method (as already commented in Section 2.4.1). Using the optimised conditions shown in Table 2 , a better cavitation process was achieved.\nThe water volume is one of principal factors for obtaining good results in ultrasonic applications. Thus, a volume of 1000 ml was used because it produces good performance in the extraction procedures. Using other volumes gave worse results for the iodine method.\nIt is interesting to note that better cavitation effects were observed when only one tube was sonicated, producing higher absorbances from the KI reaction. In this sense, the central position with the tube positioned 0 cm from the bottom of bath was determined as the best position for a higher cavitation process.\nThe temperature was chosen because it was possible to work in the environmental temperature, and higher temperatures did not improve the cavitation process.\nConcentrations of detergent higher than 0.2% (w/v) were not used, due to an increase in solid particles in the liquid phase of the ultrasonic bath, which diminished the ultrasound propagation. The 0.2% concentration gave the best conditions for cavitation.\nIn order to select the optimum conditions for extraction, two different vegetables were studied: lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea capitata). The Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn extractions were evaluated by varying the acid concentration and the sonication time.\nThe extraction of the elements studied was checked by comparing the proposed fast extraction method with the wet digestion method .\nThe results obtained in the optimisation are shown in Fig. 1 . Both parameters studied (acid concentration and sonication time) have an influence on the extraction efficiency, although the effect of acid concentration is more pronounced. These results are similar to those obtained for Pb extraction in different samples using an ultrasonic probe and bath . Fig. 1 shows that incomplete extraction occurs when only water is used, indicating the necessity of acid as an extractor for Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn. However, the extractions are quite similar when the acid concentration was varied from 0.14 to 1.4 mol l\u22121, since only slight variations (ca. 3%) were obtained for all the elements studied.\nSonication improved the extraction process. Quantitative extractions were obtained after 10 or 20 min of sonication time and were dependent on the metal studied. When a time of 30 min was used, lower extractions were obtained (Fig. 1). As different species can be formed during sonication, it is possible that a longer sonication time provokes the re-combination of different structures in the liquid, forming new species and reducing ions in the liquid phase .\nUsing 0.14 mol l\u22121 nitric acid and 10 min for the sonication time, better conditions for extraction were achieved for the elements studied, except for iron in lettuce, which produced lower recoveries compared to those with wet digestion. This may be due to depression of the Fe response in the presence of organic acids . The use of 1.4 mol l\u22121 HNO3 results in better recoveries for iron. This can be explained by the higher concentration of HNO3 used. Sometimes the use of an acid mixture or of oxidising agents is an effective way for obtaining complete extraction of iron .\nExcept for iron, it is interesting to note that the extraction efficiency for the other metals was similar for lettuce and cabbage samples extracted with only 0.14 mol l\u22121 nitric acid.\nUsing the cabbage samples, a study of particle size was performed, where this parameter was varied from 63 to 150 \u03bcm, with the samples being sonicated for 10 min.\nThe particle size was an important factor for Ca, Fe, Mn and Zn extraction, where recoveries of ca. 100% were obtained with <75 \u03bcm particle size. This was confirmed by applying the t-test at a 95% confidence level to the results obtained with wet digestion, also using the same particle sizes. This test was performed because different results could be produced due to the natural distribution of the metal in the different particle sizes . In this way, the <75 \u03bcm particle size was chosen for evaluation of the accuracy.\nThe accuracy of ultrasonic extraction for the proposed method was determined by comparing the results with those obtained using a different digestion method for lettuce, cabbage and a medicinal plant (Equisetum pyramidale), as well as by analysing different CRM materials, such as spinach (NIST 1570a) and apple leaves (NIST 1515). The results, presented in Table 3 , show that no statistical differences were observed at the 95% confidence level, indicating that the fast extraction method with sonication is applicable for this type of sample, opening the possibility of its application for other samples.\nThe results for iron are not shown, since its recovery (ca. 98%) was only acceptable for cabbage (see Fig. 1).\nThe proposed method permitted a fast, easy and inexpensive extraction of Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn in different plant materials, and in some instances for Fe.\nAll parameters studied (acid concentration, sonication time and particle size) influence the extraction efficiency. The results obtained with this method and with wet digestion were similar, allowing the substitution of hazardous and/or problematic handling methods for routine analyses in environmental or agronomic studies."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nChlorine and ozone are the two disinfectants widely used in drinking water disinfection. Despite the benefits of these two disinfectants, disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed due to the interaction of aqueous free chlorine and/or ozone with natural organic matter present in water. Trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, cyanogen halides, chloral hydrate and chloropicrin have been reported as the main chlorination DBP groups . Aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, aldoacids, organic peroxides and epoxides are the main ozone DBP groups, resulted from the reaction between ozone with aromatic compounds, amino acids and polypeptides present in water, which are considered as their precursors . Aldehydes are one of the main ozonation DBPs due to their health effects, although no legislation has been established for their control. Formaldehyde is a mutagenic and carcinogen compound ; acetaldehyde induces tumors ; propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal, nonanal, glyoxal, methyl glyoxal are mutagens in laboratory animals. On the other hand, aldehydes exhibit high biodegradability capable of increasing the microorganism level after the ozonation process .\nAlthough the aldehyde formation is associated with the ozonation process, it can be related in minor grade with the chlorination of raw water. Different aldehydes were identified as a result of the chlorination of some aminoacids such as isobutyraldehyde (resulting of valine chlorination), isovaleraldehyde (leucine), 2-methylbutyraldehyde (isoleucine) and phenylacetaldehyde (phenylalanine) . Complaints from consumers related to the presence of these aldehydes were reported in water treatment plants in France and in Canada when their concentrations were 10\u201350 times higher than their respective odor threshold concentrations (0.9 \u03bcg/l for isobutyraldehyde, 0.15\u20130.2 \u03bcg/l for isovaleraldehyde, 12.5 \u03bcg/l for 2-methylbutyraldehyde and 4.0 \u03bcg/l for phenylacetaldehyde) .\nThe high polarity and reactivity of carbonyl compounds in water matrices impose the need for their derivatization prior to their detection by chromatographic techniques. A suitable method involves the direct aqueous derivatization with o-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA), which reacts with low molecular mass carbonyl compounds and aldehydes to form the corresponding oximes. Two geometrical isomers (E and Z) are formed for simple aldehydes except for formaldehyde or symmetrical carbonyls. Another method commonly applied utilizes 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DPNH) as a reagent to form hydrazone derivatives (E and Z isomers). PFBHA derivatization is followed by GC\u2013ECD or GC\u2013MS; aldehyde derivatives present halogen atoms which justifies ECD detection. Meanwhile, DPNH derivatization is followed by GC\u2013MS and HPLC\u2013MS analysis . There are also other derivatization agents such as thiazolidine, morpholine, methylhydrazine or N-benzylethanolamine which have been less employed . Although these methods provide good reproducibility, they involve an extensive work-up, consume materials, and solvents for the derivatization and isolation steps using liquid\u2013liquid (LLE) or solid-phase extraction techniques (SPE).\nIn recent years, a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique developed by Pawliszyn and co-workers has become popular for the analysis of organic compounds from water samples because it combines sampling and preconcentration in one step . This technique uses a polymer-coated silica fiber to adsorb the analytes directly from the liquid or from the headspace above the liquid; after extraction, the fiber is inserted into the GC injector to desorb the analytes into the GC column. It requires no solvents, or complicated apparatus and allows to quantify over a wide range of analyte concentrations. Determination of analytes concentrated on SPME fibers is performed using GC followed by ECD, NPD, MS detection and/or HPLC\u2013MS, which have been applied to the determination of organic compounds in water such as VOCs, BTEXs, phenols, surfactants, odor compounds, PAHs, pesticides and disinfection by-products .\nSPME has been also applied for the analysis of carbonyl compounds. Bao and co-workers determined 23 carbonyl compounds formed in a water treatment plant which were derivatized with PFBHA, extracted with a 100-poly(dimethylpolysiloxane) (PDMS) fiber from liquid or headspace and finally analysed by GC\u2013ECD but only the 100-PDMS fiber was tested in this study. A new analytical method was developed to determine formaldehyde in air consisting of on-7 \u03bcm-PDMS fiber derivatization, introducing previously the coating in a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine or acetophenone solution, and followed by GC\u2013MS . A similar method considering PFBHA as derivatization reagent and a PDMS\u2013DVB fiber followed by GC\u2013FID analysis was also proposed for this carbonyl compound . A SPME method has been developed using as well on fiber derivatisation applied to the analysis of volatile carbonyl compounds formed during the thermally-induced peroxidation of vegetable oils . Finally, Keszler and coworkers determined the aliphatic aldehydes, which are indicators of rancidity of vegetable oils by headspace-SPME sampling followed by ion-trap GC\u2013MS .\nThe aim of this study is to develop an alternative method to EPA Method 556 , based on a PFBHA derivatization and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by GC\u2013ECD, for the determination of aldehydes formed as a consequence of disinfection drinking water. This converts SPME as an alternative to the liquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE) proposed in the EPA method. Six SPME fibers commercially available were considered. Experimental parameters which affect the adsorption and desorption processes were studied for the most appropriate one. Once optimized the HS-SPME procedure, quality parameters such as precision, linear range and limits of detection were determined. HS-SPME technique was compared with LLE (following the experimental protocol described in EPA Method 556) in spiked water samples analysis; a reasonable agreement between results obtained with both techniques was observed. Finally, aldehyde levels in Barcelona\u2019s water treatment plant (N.E. Spain), where the Llobregat river is treated, were measured.\nStandards of 14 carbonyl compounds studied: acetaldehyde (99%), propanal (99%), 2-methylpropanal (99%), butanal (97%), 2-methylbutanal (95%), 3-methylbutanal (97%), pentanal (97%), hexanal (98%), heptanal (95%), octanal (99%), nonanal (95%), decanal (97%), glyoxal and methyl glyoxal (40% aqueous solution) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). The o-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (98%, PFBHA), used as a derivatization reagent of the carbonyl compounds, was purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). The chemical reagents 2,4,5-trifluoroacetophenone (99%) and 1,2-dibromopropane, used as a surrogate and internal standard respectively, and potassium hydrogen phthalate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Other reagents were methanol purge and trap grade from Sigma Aldrich; and sodium sulfate ACS\u2013ISO for analysis, sodium chloride ISO for analysis, copper sulfate pentahydrate ACS\u2013ISO for analysis and sulfuric acid form Carlo Erba (Italy). Ultrapure water was from a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, USA). For the extraction, water samples were placed in 40 ml EPA vials (Wheaton, USA) equipped with stir bars and sealed with PTFE-faced silicone septa.\nStock standard solutions were prepared in methanol by weighing approximately 0.1 g of analyte into 10-ml volumetric flask and diluting to volume; they were kept at \u221220\u00b0C. Secondary standard solutions were prepared by dilution in methanol of primary standard to give concentrations of 50 mg/l. Stock and secondary standard solutions of the substances used as surrogate and internal standard were prepared in the same way. The aqueous solution of PFBHA used as derivatization agent was prepared daily to give concentration of 15 mg/ml. Ultrapure water solutions were prepared by spiking with different amounts of the secondary standard and used in the recovery study and for calibration.\nFormaldehyde and acetaldehyde were present in ultrapure water as interferences at levels of 3 \u03bcg/l. Munch and coworkers have observed similar carbonyl impurities in purified and bottled reagent water and they reported that purified water rapidly absorbs volatile carbonyl compounds from the air . In order to remove these carbonyl impurities from the air reagent water (1 l), to which potassium permanganate (128 mg) and concentrated sulfuric acid (2 ml) have been previously added, was bidistilled in order to avoid the background levels of aldehydes. The acetaldehyde was completely removed meanwhile residues of formaldehyde were still present and therefore formaldehyde was not considered for quantification.\nFor HS-SPME, 100 \u03bcm-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), 65 \u03bcm-divinylbenzene\u2013polydimethylsiloxane (DVB\u2013PDMS), 85 \u03bcm-polyacrylate (PA), 75 \u03bcm-carboxen\u2013polydimethylsiloxane (CAR\u2013PDMS), 65 \u03bcm-carbowax\u2013divinylbenzene (CWX\u2013DVB) and 50/30 \u03bcm divinylbenzene\u2013carboxen\u2013polydimethylsiloxane (DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS) fused-silica fibers were evaluated to determine aldehydes in water samples. The commercially available SPME device and the fibers were purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). Fibers were initially conditioned according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in order to remove contaminants and to stabilize the solid-phase. Conditioning was carried out in an extra split/splitless port (split open) with helium carrier gas prior to each extraction. This procedure prevents the passive extraction of interfering analytes from ambient air.\nWater samples from successive stages of the Barcelona\u2019s water treatment plant were collected in 100-ml glass bottles with PTFE-faced septa and polypropylene screw caps. A volume of 0.1 ml of 0.1 M sodium thiosulfate solution was added to each bottle (100 ml) prior to analysis to eliminate free chlorine and to prevent the production of further disinfection by-products (DBPs). Copper sulfate pentahydrate (50 mg) which acts as a biocide to inhibit bacteriological decay of method analytes was added.\nAldehyde derivatization is based on the derivatization procedure described in EPA 556 method . Water samples (30 ml) were placed in 40-ml EPA glass vials. To each sample, 2,4,5-trifluoroacetophenone (4 \u03bcl of a methanolic solution of 50 mg/l) was added as an internal standard. Water samples were adjusted to pH 4 with potassium hydrogen phthalate (200 mg) and the carbonyl compounds were derivatized with PFBHA (1 ml of an aqueous solution of 15 mg/l) at 45\u00b0C for 1 h and 45 min. Once vials reached room temperature after the derivatization process was finished, sulfuric acid (two drops) was added in order to protonate the residual PFBHA agent. As a result of this process, (E) and (Z) pentafluorobenzyloxime isomers were obtained for the carbonyl compounds that are not symmetrical. Compounds with two carbonyl groups, such as glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, produced four isomers.\nTo each derivatized sample (30 ml), 1,2-dibromopropane (3 \u03bcl of a methanolic solution of 50 mg/l) as an internal standard and sodium chloride (6 g) were added before the extraction process. The vial was sealed with a PTFE-faced septum cap and the SPME fiber was exposed to the headspace. The sample was agitated with a magnetic stirring bar at 1100 rev./min at room temperature (22\u00b0C) during the extraction process (40 min) to allow the equilibration of analytes between the aqueous phase and the headspace and immediately inserted into the gas chromatographic port for thermal desorption of the extracted analytes.\nDerivatization and extraction processes were performed at the experimental conditions described in EPA Method 556 .\nGas chromatography was carried out with a Fisons Top 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detection (ECD) system. A DB-1701 fused-silica column (J&W Scientific) with a 1.0 \u03bcm film thickness, 30 m\u00d7320 \u03bcm I.D., was used. The GC temperature program was 50\u00b0C (1 min) to 265\u00b0C (5 min) at 5\u00b0C/min. Carrier gas was helium (88 kPa) and nitrogen (33 ml/min) as a make-up. Injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 300\u00b0C, respectively.\nIn order to develop an HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method for the analysis of aldehydes, several experimental parameters such as SPME coating, effect of headspace volume, effect of addition of salt, extraction time and desorption conditions were optimized. HS-SPME sampling was used due to the higher diffusion of the analytes in air than in water .\nThe SPME theory dictates that analytes in water are transferred to the phase coating of the fused-silica fiber; equilibrium process was finally established between the concentration of the analytes in solution and the concentration of analytes in the phase coating. The choice of an appropriate coating is essential for the establishment of a SPME method and it is dependent of the chemical nature of the target analytes (polarity and volatility). Although aldehydes are polar compounds, derivatization allows to decrease their polarity and therefore the use of apolar coatings/fibers. PDMS presents a non polar phase which extracts efficiently non polar analytes. The PA phase is suitable for more polar compounds. In mixed phases, DVB or CAR porous microspheres are immobilized on the fiber by using CWX or PDMS as glue to hold them together.\nSix SPME fiber coatings were evaluated to select the appropriate coating for the method. A fortified aqueous sample (20 ml spiked at a level of 5 \u03bcg/l of each carbonyl compound) was analyzed twice with each fiber once the previous derivatization process was finished. The extraction time was 15 min at room temperature and desorption time was 1 min (split mode: 1/125) at 250\u00b0C for all fibers. The extraction efficiency of the SPME fibers was evaluated by plotting the ECD areas obtained for each carbonyl compound with the different fibers.\n(E) and (Z) isomers formed as a consequence of the derivatization reaction were obtained for that aldehyde compounds which are not symmetrical. Thus, two chromatographic peaks were observed for many target analytes with all SPME fibers tested. (E) and (Z) isomers could not be chromatographically resolved in a few cases such as 2-methylbutanal, nonanal and decanal with the chromatographic conditions employed. Compounds having two carbonyls, such as glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, the (E) and (Z) isomerism occurred from oxime formation with both carbonyl groups, thus increasing the number of isomers to four; a coelution between two signals from glyoxal and methylglyoxal was observed. Undentified peaks labeled as \u201cd\u201d peaks were identified as artifacts from PFBHA but they do not interfere with the analysis of the compounds studied. The PFBHA-HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD profile for the derivatized aldehydes is shown in Fig. 1 .\nThe sum of the isomer peak areas for each compound was considered as the total area for quantitation purposes. Comparison of the oxime derivate amounts adsorbed on the coated fibers can be seen in Fig. 2 . Mixed SPME phases are more suitable than the 100 \u03bcm-PDMS proposed by Bao and co-workers . Extraction efficiencies for the C2\u2013C5 carbonyl compounds decreased following the behavior DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS>DVB\u2013PDMS>100 \u03bcm-PDMS>CWX\u2013DVB>CAR\u2013PDMS>PA. However, for butanal, 2-methyl-, 3-methylbutanal and pentanal, the PA extraction efficiency was higher than obtained with CAR\u2013PDMS. For the C6\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, the PA, 100 \u03bcm-PDMS, DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS fibers presented a similar response whereas the CAR\u2013PDMS and CWX\u2013DVB produced a lower response. Due to DVB\u2013PDMS allowing a higher adsorption for the C6\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal than DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS did, DVB\u2013PDMS was chosen as the most appropriate.\nSPME theory dictates that the volume of the gaseous phase should be minimized in order to obtain the high sensitivity headspace extraction. To optimize the extraction procedure of the carbonyl compound, the effect of the water sample and the headspace volumes were studied. This experiment was performed using EPA 40-ml vials and increasing the volume of a fortified aqueous sample (spiked at 5 \u03bcg/l) from 10 to 30 ml. After the derivatization process, aqueous samples were analyzed twice with the DVB\u2013PDMS fiber. The extraction time was 15 min at room temperature; the desorption time was 1 min (split mode: 1/125) at 200\u00b0C.\nThe obtained results showed that the extraction of the carbonyl compounds is affected by the volume of headspace into which the analytes diffuse. An increase in the peak area was obtained for each analyte when headspace volume decreased from 30 to 10 ml. Further experiments were performed using 30 ml of water sample.\nWith the addition of salt into the aqueous sample previously to the extraction process, an increase of the ionic strength of the solution was obtained. As a consequence, the diffusion of analytes into the headspace is favoured and extraction time for each analyte is reduced. This behavior was observed when fortified aqueous samples (spiked at 5 \u03bcg/l) were previously salted with NaCl (6 g) and analyzed following the experimental conditions described above. The addition of salt has a significant effect on the extraction of the C2\u2013C8 carbonyl compounds meanwhile it was slightly lower on the extraction of nonanal, decanal, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal. As a conclusion, further experiments were performed using 6 g of NaCl.\nThe DVB\u2013PDMS fiber extracts basically the derivates of carbonyl compounds by total adsorption due to the presence of DVB porous microspheres immobilized on the fiber by using PDMS. The adsorption time profiles of DVB\u2013PDMS fiber were obtained by plotting the ECD response versus the extraction time, as can be seen in Fig. 3 ; optimum sorption time is defined as the time after which the amount of extracted analyte remains constant. Duplicate water samples were analyzed under the experimental conditions described in the HS-SPME procedure. ECD areas obtained at 20 and 60 min were compared and it was observed that 20 min was not enough to reach the equilibrium, specially for the higher molecular mass compounds. No significant differences were observed in ECD areas registered at 40 and 60 min. As a conclusion, 40 min was considered as the optimized exposure time for all the compounds studied.\nThe GC injector temperature and the appropriate desorption time were also evaluated to ensure that oxime derivates were completely desorbed from the fiber in order to reach the highest sensitivity and to avoid carryover. For the DVB\u2013PDMS fiber, different GC injector temperatures between 200 and 270\u00b0C were tested, it was found that 200\u00b0C was the most appropriate to avoid thermal degradation of the derivates. Desorption profiles (Fig. 4 ) showed that 5 min was enough to ensure total desorption and no peaks appeared in the chromatogram corresponding to the analysis of the fiber prior to re-exposure.\nQuality parameters such as linearity, limits of detection and precision were calculated when the optimum conditions for the HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD procedure were established.\nThe linearity of the HS-SPME method was obtained by plotting the calibration curves of the total area (sum of (E) and (Z) isomers) relative to the internal standard 1,2-dibromopropane (AE+Z/A is) versus the concentration of each carbonyl compound (C i). Standard calibration curves were plotted for concentrations from 0.1 to 30 \u03bcg/l. The linear ranges and the correlation coefficients (r 2) obtained for each compound are given in Table 1 . The seven-point calibration curve was found to have good linearity with linear ranges between 0.5 and 15 \u03bcg/l for greater part of aldehydes and correlation coefficients better than 0.994. These calibration ranges differ from the 0.1\u2013100 \u03bcg/l for C2\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds and 0.1\u201350 \u03bcg/l for glyoxal and methyl glyoxal obtained by Bao et al. . Linear behaviour indicated that there was not adsorption of PFBHA-derivatives on the magnetic stir bar.\nThe sensitivity of the HS-SPME method was evaluated in terms of limit of detection (LOD). This parameter was calculated experimentally by spiking ultrapure water with aldehydes at concentration levels close to the theoretical LODs and produced a signal three times greater than the baseline noise. Under the experimental conditions, LODs were between 0.04 and 0.16 \u03bcg/l, as can be seen in Table 1. Glyoxal (0.40 \u03bcg/l) and methyl glyoxal (0.30 \u03bcg/l) exhibit high LODs versus the C2\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds due to the PFBHA derivates of these two dialdehydes presented the highest molecular masses and the lowest volatility.\nThe repeatability and reproducibility of the HS-SPME method were evaluated by analyzing five ultrapure water samples (spiked at 5 \u03bcg/l of each aldehyde) on the same day and a total of a nine samples on 3 different days, respectively. Results reported in Table 1 showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD%) for repeatability ranged from 2.6 to 15.8%, being higher for the heaviest carbonyl compounds; whereas the RSD for the reproducibility ranged from 4.9 to 14.9%, following the same tendency as repeatability, except for nonanal and decanal which presented a RSD value of 22.6%. These values are in the same order that those reported by Bao et al. .\nThe optimized HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method was compared with EPA Method 556 for the determination of carbonyl compounds by spiking samples of ultrapure water at 1.0 and 3.0 \u03bcg/l (n=3). Quantitation was performed using the calibration curve for each compound relative to the internal standard (1,2-dibromopropane). Results are shown in Table 2 .\nStandard deviation and mean values were compared using the F-Fischer test (95% probability) and the Student\u2019s t-test (95% probability and two sides), respectively . No significant differences were found between the results given by these two extraction techniques except for heptanal, octanal and nonanal. HS-SPME method can be considered a good alternative to LLE extraction with hexane proposed in EPA method with the advantage that solvent is not needed and it is faster due to the fact that intensive manual labor is avoided.\nAldehydes formed as a consequence of the disinfection process was monitored at the Barcelona treatment plant (Table 2). Salt mines located in the upper course of the river are responsible for the high bromide concentration in raw water. The plant carries out conventional treatment, consisting of prechlorination (to break-point), flocculation (settling), sand filtration, ozonization, GAC filtration and postchlorination with a lower dosage of chlorine, to guarantee a 0.5\u20131 mg/l concentration in the distribution system. Aldehydes were determined at the postchlorinated water. Results obtained showed that acetaldehyde (0.8 \u03bcg/l), propanal (0.5 \u03bcg/l), glyoxal (0.25 \u03bcg/l) and methyl glyoxal (0.15 \u03bcg/l) are the main ozonation DBPs formed. Total concentration of these by-products was lower than 2.0 \u03bcg/l and no health effects can be associated to this level. On the other hand, no aldehydes resulting from the chlorination of raw water were identified which decrease the presence of odour episodes.\nThe optimized HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method allows to determine aldehydes in water at sub-\u03bcg/l levels. A previous derivatization process with PFBHA is necessary in order to obtain the corresponding oxime derivates which are less polars and unstables. The DVB\u2013PDMS fiber is the most suitable for extracting quantitatively the oxime derivates of these ozonation by-products. Equilibrium tooks place at room temperature and the sensitivity was improved by the addition of salt. The optimized method has an acceptable linearity in the range of concentrations formed in water treatment plants with an associated precision between 3 and 10% for practically all the compounds studied.\nThe HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method can be considered as a good alternative to LLE proposed in the EPA Method 556 for monitoring aldehydes in drinking water samples. The optimized method presents the following advantages: it is faster, inexpensive, no solvents are consumed and no intensive manipulation is performed.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Chlorine and ozone are the two disinfectants widely used in drinking water disinfection. Despite the benefits of these two disinfectants, disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed due to the interaction of aqueous free chlorine and/or ozone with natural organic matter present in water. Trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, cyanogen halides, chloral hydrate and chloropicrin have been reported as the main chlorination DBP groups . Aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, aldoacids, organic peroxides and epoxides are the main ozone DBP groups, resulted from the reaction between ozone with aromatic compounds, amino acids and polypeptides present in water, which are considered as their precursors . Aldehydes are one of the main ozonation DBPs due to their health effects, although no legislation has been established for their control. Formaldehyde is a mutagenic and carcinogen compound ; acetaldehyde induces tumors ; propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal, nonanal, glyoxal, methyl glyoxal are mutagens in laboratory animals. On the other hand, aldehydes exhibit high biodegradability capable of increasing the microorganism level after the ozonation process .\nAlthough the aldehyde formation is associated with the ozonation process, it can be related in minor grade with the chlorination of raw water. Different aldehydes were identified as a result of the chlorination of some aminoacids such as isobutyraldehyde (resulting of valine chlorination), isovaleraldehyde (leucine), 2-methylbutyraldehyde (isoleucine) and phenylacetaldehyde (phenylalanine) . Complaints from consumers related to the presence of these aldehydes were reported in water treatment plants in France and in Canada when their concentrations were 10\u201350 times higher than their respective odor threshold concentrations (0.9 \u03bcg/l for isobutyraldehyde, 0.15\u20130.2 \u03bcg/l for isovaleraldehyde, 12.5 \u03bcg/l for 2-methylbutyraldehyde and 4.0 \u03bcg/l for phenylacetaldehyde) .\nThe high polarity and reactivity of carbonyl compounds in water matrices impose the need for their derivatization prior to their detection by chromatographic techniques. A suitable method involves the direct aqueous derivatization with o-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA), which reacts with low molecular mass carbonyl compounds and aldehydes to form the corresponding oximes. Two geometrical isomers (E and Z) are formed for simple aldehydes except for formaldehyde or symmetrical carbonyls. Another method commonly applied utilizes 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DPNH) as a reagent to form hydrazone derivatives (E and Z isomers). PFBHA derivatization is followed by GC\u2013ECD or GC\u2013MS; aldehyde derivatives present halogen atoms which justifies ECD detection. Meanwhile, DPNH derivatization is followed by GC\u2013MS and HPLC\u2013MS analysis . There are also other derivatization agents such as thiazolidine, morpholine, methylhydrazine or N-benzylethanolamine which have been less employed . Although these methods provide good reproducibility, they involve an extensive work-up, consume materials, and solvents for the derivatization and isolation steps using liquid\u2013liquid (LLE) or solid-phase extraction techniques (SPE).\nIn recent years, a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique developed by Pawliszyn and co-workers has become popular for the analysis of organic compounds from water samples because it combines sampling and preconcentration in one step . This technique uses a polymer-coated silica fiber to adsorb the analytes directly from the liquid or from the headspace above the liquid; after extraction, the fiber is inserted into the GC injector to desorb the analytes into the GC column. It requires no solvents, or complicated apparatus and allows to quantify over a wide range of analyte concentrations. Determination of analytes concentrated on SPME fibers is performed using GC followed by ECD, NPD, MS detection and/or HPLC\u2013MS, which have been applied to the determination of organic compounds in water such as VOCs, BTEXs, phenols, surfactants, odor compounds, PAHs, pesticides and disinfection by-products .\nSPME has been also applied for the analysis of carbonyl compounds. Bao and co-workers determined 23 carbonyl compounds formed in a water treatment plant which were derivatized with PFBHA, extracted with a 100-poly(dimethylpolysiloxane) (PDMS) fiber from liquid or headspace and finally analysed by GC\u2013ECD but only the 100-PDMS fiber was tested in this study. A new analytical method was developed to determine formaldehyde in air consisting of on-7 \u03bcm-PDMS fiber derivatization, introducing previously the coating in a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine or acetophenone solution, and followed by GC\u2013MS . A similar method considering PFBHA as derivatization reagent and a PDMS\u2013DVB fiber followed by GC\u2013FID analysis was also proposed for this carbonyl compound . A SPME method has been developed using as well on fiber derivatisation applied to the analysis of volatile carbonyl compounds formed during the thermally-induced peroxidation of vegetable oils . Finally, Keszler and coworkers determined the aliphatic aldehydes, which are indicators of rancidity of vegetable oils by headspace-SPME sampling followed by ion-trap GC\u2013MS .\nThe aim of this study is to develop an alternative method to EPA Method 556 , based on a PFBHA derivatization and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by GC\u2013ECD, for the determination of aldehydes formed as a consequence of disinfection drinking water. This converts SPME as an alternative to the liquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE) proposed in the EPA method. Six SPME fibers commercially available were considered. Experimental parameters which affect the adsorption and desorption processes were studied for the most appropriate one. Once optimized the HS-SPME procedure, quality parameters such as precision, linear range and limits of detection were determined. HS-SPME technique was compared with LLE (following the experimental protocol described in EPA Method 556) in spiked water samples analysis; a reasonable agreement between results obtained with both techniques was observed. Finally, aldehyde levels in Barcelona\u2019s water treatment plant (N.E. Spain), where the Llobregat river is treated, were measured.\nStandards of 14 carbonyl compounds studied: acetaldehyde (99%), propanal (99%), 2-methylpropanal (99%), butanal (97%), 2-methylbutanal (95%), 3-methylbutanal (97%), pentanal (97%), hexanal (98%), heptanal (95%), octanal (99%), nonanal (95%), decanal (97%), glyoxal and methyl glyoxal (40% aqueous solution) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). The o-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (98%, PFBHA), used as a derivatization reagent of the carbonyl compounds, was purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). The chemical reagents 2,4,5-trifluoroacetophenone (99%) and 1,2-dibromopropane, used as a surrogate and internal standard respectively, and potassium hydrogen phthalate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Other reagents were methanol purge and trap grade from Sigma Aldrich; and sodium sulfate ACS\u2013ISO for analysis, sodium chloride ISO for analysis, copper sulfate pentahydrate ACS\u2013ISO for analysis and sulfuric acid form Carlo Erba (Italy). Ultrapure water was from a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, USA). For the extraction, water samples were placed in 40 ml EPA vials (Wheaton, USA) equipped with stir bars and sealed with PTFE-faced silicone septa.\nStock standard solutions were prepared in methanol by weighing approximately 0.1 g of analyte into 10-ml volumetric flask and diluting to volume; they were kept at \u221220\u00b0C. Secondary standard solutions were prepared by dilution in methanol of primary standard to give concentrations of 50 mg/l. Stock and secondary standard solutions of the substances used as surrogate and internal standard were prepared in the same way. The aqueous solution of PFBHA used as derivatization agent was prepared daily to give concentration of 15 mg/ml. Ultrapure water solutions were prepared by spiking with different amounts of the secondary standard and used in the recovery study and for calibration.\nFormaldehyde and acetaldehyde were present in ultrapure water as interferences at levels of 3 \u03bcg/l. Munch and coworkers have observed similar carbonyl impurities in purified and bottled reagent water and they reported that purified water rapidly absorbs volatile carbonyl compounds from the air . In order to remove these carbonyl impurities from the air reagent water (1 l), to which potassium permanganate (128 mg) and concentrated sulfuric acid (2 ml) have been previously added, was bidistilled in order to avoid the background levels of aldehydes. The acetaldehyde was completely removed meanwhile residues of formaldehyde were still present and therefore formaldehyde was not considered for quantification.\nFor HS-SPME, 100 \u03bcm-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), 65 \u03bcm-divinylbenzene\u2013polydimethylsiloxane (DVB\u2013PDMS), 85 \u03bcm-polyacrylate (PA), 75 \u03bcm-carboxen\u2013polydimethylsiloxane (CAR\u2013PDMS), 65 \u03bcm-carbowax\u2013divinylbenzene (CWX\u2013DVB) and 50/30 \u03bcm divinylbenzene\u2013carboxen\u2013polydimethylsiloxane (DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS) fused-silica fibers were evaluated to determine aldehydes in water samples. The commercially available SPME device and the fibers were purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). Fibers were initially conditioned according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in order to remove contaminants and to stabilize the solid-phase. Conditioning was carried out in an extra split/splitless port (split open) with helium carrier gas prior to each extraction. This procedure prevents the passive extraction of interfering analytes from ambient air.\nWater samples from successive stages of the Barcelona\u2019s water treatment plant were collected in 100-ml glass bottles with PTFE-faced septa and polypropylene screw caps. A volume of 0.1 ml of 0.1 M sodium thiosulfate solution was added to each bottle (100 ml) prior to analysis to eliminate free chlorine and to prevent the production of further disinfection by-products (DBPs). Copper sulfate pentahydrate (50 mg) which acts as a biocide to inhibit bacteriological decay of method analytes was added.\nAldehyde derivatization is based on the derivatization procedure described in EPA 556 method . Water samples (30 ml) were placed in 40-ml EPA glass vials. To each sample, 2,4,5-trifluoroacetophenone (4 \u03bcl of a methanolic solution of 50 mg/l) was added as an internal standard. Water samples were adjusted to pH 4 with potassium hydrogen phthalate (200 mg) and the carbonyl compounds were derivatized with PFBHA (1 ml of an aqueous solution of 15 mg/l) at 45\u00b0C for 1 h and 45 min. Once vials reached room temperature after the derivatization process was finished, sulfuric acid (two drops) was added in order to protonate the residual PFBHA agent. As a result of this process, (E) and (Z) pentafluorobenzyloxime isomers were obtained for the carbonyl compounds that are not symmetrical. Compounds with two carbonyl groups, such as glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, produced four isomers.\nTo each derivatized sample (30 ml), 1,2-dibromopropane (3 \u03bcl of a methanolic solution of 50 mg/l) as an internal standard and sodium chloride (6 g) were added before the extraction process. The vial was sealed with a PTFE-faced septum cap and the SPME fiber was exposed to the headspace. The sample was agitated with a magnetic stirring bar at 1100 rev./min at room temperature (22\u00b0C) during the extraction process (40 min) to allow the equilibration of analytes between the aqueous phase and the headspace and immediately inserted into the gas chromatographic port for thermal desorption of the extracted analytes.\nDerivatization and extraction processes were performed at the experimental conditions described in EPA Method 556 .\nGas chromatography was carried out with a Fisons Top 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detection (ECD) system. A DB-1701 fused-silica column (J&W Scientific) with a 1.0 \u03bcm film thickness, 30 m\u00d7320 \u03bcm I.D., was used. The GC temperature program was 50\u00b0C (1 min) to 265\u00b0C (5 min) at 5\u00b0C/min. Carrier gas was helium (88 kPa) and nitrogen (33 ml/min) as a make-up. Injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 300\u00b0C, respectively.\nIn order to develop an HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method for the analysis of aldehydes, several experimental parameters such as SPME coating, effect of headspace volume, effect of addition of salt, extraction time and desorption conditions were optimized. HS-SPME sampling was used due to the higher diffusion of the analytes in air than in water .\nThe SPME theory dictates that analytes in water are transferred to the phase coating of the fused-silica fiber; equilibrium process was finally established between the concentration of the analytes in solution and the concentration of analytes in the phase coating. The choice of an appropriate coating is essential for the establishment of a SPME method and it is dependent of the chemical nature of the target analytes (polarity and volatility). Although aldehydes are polar compounds, derivatization allows to decrease their polarity and therefore the use of apolar coatings/fibers. PDMS presents a non polar phase which extracts efficiently non polar analytes. The PA phase is suitable for more polar compounds. In mixed phases, DVB or CAR porous microspheres are immobilized on the fiber by using CWX or PDMS as glue to hold them together.\nSix SPME fiber coatings were evaluated to select the appropriate coating for the method. A fortified aqueous sample (20 ml spiked at a level of 5 \u03bcg/l of each carbonyl compound) was analyzed twice with each fiber once the previous derivatization process was finished. The extraction time was 15 min at room temperature and desorption time was 1 min (split mode: 1/125) at 250\u00b0C for all fibers. The extraction efficiency of the SPME fibers was evaluated by plotting the ECD areas obtained for each carbonyl compound with the different fibers.\n(E) and (Z) isomers formed as a consequence of the derivatization reaction were obtained for that aldehyde compounds which are not symmetrical. Thus, two chromatographic peaks were observed for many target analytes with all SPME fibers tested. (E) and (Z) isomers could not be chromatographically resolved in a few cases such as 2-methylbutanal, nonanal and decanal with the chromatographic conditions employed. Compounds having two carbonyls, such as glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, the (E) and (Z) isomerism occurred from oxime formation with both carbonyl groups, thus increasing the number of isomers to four; a coelution between two signals from glyoxal and methylglyoxal was observed. Undentified peaks labeled as \u201cd\u201d peaks were identified as artifacts from PFBHA but they do not interfere with the analysis of the compounds studied. The PFBHA-HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD profile for the derivatized aldehydes is shown in Fig. 1 .\nThe sum of the isomer peak areas for each compound was considered as the total area for quantitation purposes. Comparison of the oxime derivate amounts adsorbed on the coated fibers can be seen in Fig. 2 . Mixed SPME phases are more suitable than the 100 \u03bcm-PDMS proposed by Bao and co-workers . Extraction efficiencies for the C2\u2013C5 carbonyl compounds decreased following the behavior DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS>DVB\u2013PDMS>100 \u03bcm-PDMS>CWX\u2013DVB>CAR\u2013PDMS>PA. However, for butanal, 2-methyl-, 3-methylbutanal and pentanal, the PA extraction efficiency was higher than obtained with CAR\u2013PDMS. For the C6\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal, the PA, 100 \u03bcm-PDMS, DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS fibers presented a similar response whereas the CAR\u2013PDMS and CWX\u2013DVB produced a lower response. Due to DVB\u2013PDMS allowing a higher adsorption for the C6\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal than DVB\u2013CAR\u2013PDMS did, DVB\u2013PDMS was chosen as the most appropriate.\nSPME theory dictates that the volume of the gaseous phase should be minimized in order to obtain the high sensitivity headspace extraction. To optimize the extraction procedure of the carbonyl compound, the effect of the water sample and the headspace volumes were studied. This experiment was performed using EPA 40-ml vials and increasing the volume of a fortified aqueous sample (spiked at 5 \u03bcg/l) from 10 to 30 ml. After the derivatization process, aqueous samples were analyzed twice with the DVB\u2013PDMS fiber. The extraction time was 15 min at room temperature; the desorption time was 1 min (split mode: 1/125) at 200\u00b0C.\nThe obtained results showed that the extraction of the carbonyl compounds is affected by the volume of headspace into which the analytes diffuse. An increase in the peak area was obtained for each analyte when headspace volume decreased from 30 to 10 ml. Further experiments were performed using 30 ml of water sample.\nWith the addition of salt into the aqueous sample previously to the extraction process, an increase of the ionic strength of the solution was obtained. As a consequence, the diffusion of analytes into the headspace is favoured and extraction time for each analyte is reduced. This behavior was observed when fortified aqueous samples (spiked at 5 \u03bcg/l) were previously salted with NaCl (6 g) and analyzed following the experimental conditions described above. The addition of salt has a significant effect on the extraction of the C2\u2013C8 carbonyl compounds meanwhile it was slightly lower on the extraction of nonanal, decanal, glyoxal and methyl glyoxal. As a conclusion, further experiments were performed using 6 g of NaCl.\nThe DVB\u2013PDMS fiber extracts basically the derivates of carbonyl compounds by total adsorption due to the presence of DVB porous microspheres immobilized on the fiber by using PDMS. The adsorption time profiles of DVB\u2013PDMS fiber were obtained by plotting the ECD response versus the extraction time, as can be seen in Fig. 3 ; optimum sorption time is defined as the time after which the amount of extracted analyte remains constant. Duplicate water samples were analyzed under the experimental conditions described in the HS-SPME procedure. ECD areas obtained at 20 and 60 min were compared and it was observed that 20 min was not enough to reach the equilibrium, specially for the higher molecular mass compounds. No significant differences were observed in ECD areas registered at 40 and 60 min. As a conclusion, 40 min was considered as the optimized exposure time for all the compounds studied.\nThe GC injector temperature and the appropriate desorption time were also evaluated to ensure that oxime derivates were completely desorbed from the fiber in order to reach the highest sensitivity and to avoid carryover. For the DVB\u2013PDMS fiber, different GC injector temperatures between 200 and 270\u00b0C were tested, it was found that 200\u00b0C was the most appropriate to avoid thermal degradation of the derivates. Desorption profiles (Fig. 4 ) showed that 5 min was enough to ensure total desorption and no peaks appeared in the chromatogram corresponding to the analysis of the fiber prior to re-exposure.\nQuality parameters such as linearity, limits of detection and precision were calculated when the optimum conditions for the HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD procedure were established.\nThe linearity of the HS-SPME method was obtained by plotting the calibration curves of the total area (sum of (E) and (Z) isomers) relative to the internal standard 1,2-dibromopropane (AE+Z/A is) versus the concentration of each carbonyl compound (C i). Standard calibration curves were plotted for concentrations from 0.1 to 30 \u03bcg/l. The linear ranges and the correlation coefficients (r 2) obtained for each compound are given in Table 1 . The seven-point calibration curve was found to have good linearity with linear ranges between 0.5 and 15 \u03bcg/l for greater part of aldehydes and correlation coefficients better than 0.994. These calibration ranges differ from the 0.1\u2013100 \u03bcg/l for C2\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds and 0.1\u201350 \u03bcg/l for glyoxal and methyl glyoxal obtained by Bao et al. . Linear behaviour indicated that there was not adsorption of PFBHA-derivatives on the magnetic stir bar.\nThe sensitivity of the HS-SPME method was evaluated in terms of limit of detection (LOD). This parameter was calculated experimentally by spiking ultrapure water with aldehydes at concentration levels close to the theoretical LODs and produced a signal three times greater than the baseline noise. Under the experimental conditions, LODs were between 0.04 and 0.16 \u03bcg/l, as can be seen in Table 1. Glyoxal (0.40 \u03bcg/l) and methyl glyoxal (0.30 \u03bcg/l) exhibit high LODs versus the C2\u2013C10 carbonyl compounds due to the PFBHA derivates of these two dialdehydes presented the highest molecular masses and the lowest volatility.\nThe repeatability and reproducibility of the HS-SPME method were evaluated by analyzing five ultrapure water samples (spiked at 5 \u03bcg/l of each aldehyde) on the same day and a total of a nine samples on 3 different days, respectively. Results reported in Table 1 showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD%) for repeatability ranged from 2.6 to 15.8%, being higher for the heaviest carbonyl compounds; whereas the RSD for the reproducibility ranged from 4.9 to 14.9%, following the same tendency as repeatability, except for nonanal and decanal which presented a RSD value of 22.6%. These values are in the same order that those reported by Bao et al. .\nThe optimized HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method was compared with EPA Method 556 for the determination of carbonyl compounds by spiking samples of ultrapure water at 1.0 and 3.0 \u03bcg/l (n=3). Quantitation was performed using the calibration curve for each compound relative to the internal standard (1,2-dibromopropane). Results are shown in Table 2 .\nStandard deviation and mean values were compared using the F-Fischer test (95% probability) and the Student\u2019s t-test (95% probability and two sides), respectively . No significant differences were found between the results given by these two extraction techniques except for heptanal, octanal and nonanal. HS-SPME method can be considered a good alternative to LLE extraction with hexane proposed in EPA method with the advantage that solvent is not needed and it is faster due to the fact that intensive manual labor is avoided.\nAldehydes formed as a consequence of the disinfection process was monitored at the Barcelona treatment plant (Table 2). Salt mines located in the upper course of the river are responsible for the high bromide concentration in raw water. The plant carries out conventional treatment, consisting of prechlorination (to break-point), flocculation (settling), sand filtration, ozonization, GAC filtration and postchlorination with a lower dosage of chlorine, to guarantee a 0.5\u20131 mg/l concentration in the distribution system. Aldehydes were determined at the postchlorinated water. Results obtained showed that acetaldehyde (0.8 \u03bcg/l), propanal (0.5 \u03bcg/l), glyoxal (0.25 \u03bcg/l) and methyl glyoxal (0.15 \u03bcg/l) are the main ozonation DBPs formed. Total concentration of these by-products was lower than 2.0 \u03bcg/l and no health effects can be associated to this level. On the other hand, no aldehydes resulting from the chlorination of raw water were identified which decrease the presence of odour episodes.\nThe optimized HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method allows to determine aldehydes in water at sub-\u03bcg/l levels. A previous derivatization process with PFBHA is necessary in order to obtain the corresponding oxime derivates which are less polars and unstables. The DVB\u2013PDMS fiber is the most suitable for extracting quantitatively the oxime derivates of these ozonation by-products. Equilibrium tooks place at room temperature and the sensitivity was improved by the addition of salt. The optimized method has an acceptable linearity in the range of concentrations formed in water treatment plants with an associated precision between 3 and 10% for practically all the compounds studied.\nThe HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013ECD method can be considered as a good alternative to LLE proposed in the EPA Method 556 for monitoring aldehydes in drinking water samples. The optimized method presents the following advantages: it is faster, inexpensive, no solvents are consumed and no intensive manipulation is performed."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nHydrazine is widely used as a raw material in the manufacture of agricultural chemicals, a powerful reducing agent in fuel cells , intermediates in industrial preparations of pesticides, plant-growth regulators, polymerization catalysts, corrosion inhibitor and antioxidant . It is also very important in pharmacology, because it is recognized as a carcinogenic, hepatotoxic and mutagenic substance . It has been reported that hydrazine and its derivatives have adverse health effects . Therefore, sensitive detection of hydrazine is practically important for environmental and biological analysis .\nHydroxylamine is known as a kind of reducing agents, which is widely used in industry and pharmacy. It is identified as a key intermediate in the nitrogen cycles and production of nitrous oxide . Although hydroxylamine is a well-known mutagen, moderately toxic and harmful to human, animals, and even plants , it is widely used as a raw material for the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates and final drug substances. Thus, quantitative determination of hydroxylamine is also very important both in studies of biological processes and for industrial purposes .\nNumerous methods have been developed for the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine . However, these methods had high detection limit and low precision, thus development of more sensitive and reliable method is necessary. Electroanalytical techniques were proven to be relatively direct and effective for the detection of hydrazine . Unfortunately, both of hydrazine and hydroxylamine exhibited irreversible oxidation required large overpotentials at bare carbon electrodes. Recently, various chemically modified electrodes (CMEs) have been prepared and applied in the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine , which can significantly lower the overpotentials and increase the oxidation current response.\nNoble metal nanoparticles have been extensively utilized in recent years, owing to their extraordinarily catalytic activities for both oxidation and reduction reactions. Due to the unique properties of gold nanoparticles, such as good conductivity, useful electrocatalytic ability and biocompatibility, several researchers have been devoted to fabricate electrochemical sensors and biosensors . The gold nanoparticles dispersed on various substrates have been reported, such as carbon paste electrode, self-assembled monolayer, conducting and non-conducting polymers. Among them, conducting polymers are suitable host matrices because they have advantages of permitting a facile electronic charge flow through the polymer matrix in electrochemical processes . Conducting polymers can provide not only low ohmic drops but also enhance the rate constant of electron transfer (et) process for some electroactive species. Polypyrrole (PPy) is one of most important organic conducting polymers, which have been found in wide applications in analytical chemistry. PPy nanowire has attracted much attention because of its well-ordered polymer chain structure with very high surface-to-volume ratio and small cross dimensions and highly electronic conductivity than ordinary PPy films.\nRecently, we have studied PPy nanowires and Pt nanoclusters composite for glucose determination, in which the electrochemically generated Pt nanoclusters were embedded in the PPy nanowires . In this paper, we investigated the synthesis of Au/PPy composite by a similar electrochemical method on glassy carbon electrode surface. The generated gold nanoparticles were not embedded in the PPy nanowires, but rather dispersed well on the surface of PPy nanowires in neutral electrodeposition solution. Through a suitable combination of PPy nanowires and gold nanoparticles, the Au/PPy composite can provide a porous structure with large effective surface area and highly electrocatalytic activities toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine.\nPyrrole was obtained from Aldrich and purified twice by distillation under the protection of high purity nitrogen and then kept in a refrigerator before use. Hydrazine, hydroxylamine and HAuCl4 were obtained from Chemical Reagent Company of Shanghai (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals were of analytical-reagent grade and used without further purification. Doubly distilled water and high purity N2 were used. The 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions of different pH values (PBSs) were prepared for the study. All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed on electrochemistry workstation CHI 660A (ChenHua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China). A conventional three-electrode system was used. A glassy carbon disk electrode (GCE, \u00d84.0 mm) was used as the basal electrode for fabrication. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire electrode were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode. DPV experiments were conducted at a scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121 under the instrumental conditions of 50 mV pulse amplitude, pulse width of 50 ms and pulse time of 200 ms.\nFE-SEM images of the electrode surfaces were obtained on JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microanalyser (FE-SEM) (JEOL, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB MK2 spectrometer (VG Co., UK) with Mg K\u03b1 radiation as the source for excitation. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on a MXPAHF rotating anode X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5).\nPrior to modification, the basal GCE was polished to a mirror finish using alumina slurries with different powder size down to 0.05 \u03bcm. After each polishing, the electrode was sonicated in ethanol and doubly distilled water for 5 min, successively, in order to remove any adsorbed substances on the electrode surface. Finally, it was dried under nitrogen atmosphere ready for use.\nThe synthesized polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire was fabricated according to the previous work . The PPy was electrochemically deposited at a constant potential of 0.80 V for 120 s in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.1 M carbonate containing 0.15 M pyrrole. The electrode was then transferred into 0.1 M HClO4 solution for 12 h aging. The PPy nanowires modified electrode was obtained and denoted as PPy/GCE.\nThe gold nanoparticles was electrochemically deposited on the prepared PPy/GCE by CV scanning from 0.2 V to \u22121.0 V in 0.1 M KCl solution containing 0.5 mM HAuCl4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121 for 10 cycles. The generated Au/PPy composite modified electrode was obtained and denoted as Au/PPy/GCE. An individual Au modified GCE, denoted as Au/GCE, was similarly prepared for comparison.\nFE-SEM images of the synthesized PPy nanowires matrix and the Au/PPy nanocomposite on GCE were shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1A shows the image of deposited PPy nanowire matrix, which is a sponge-like nano-matrix consisted of PPy nanowires of about 60 nm in diameter. Fig. 1B shows the morphology of the Au/PPy composite, in which the CV deposition of gold nanoparticle of about 15 nm in diameter is attached on the surface and aligned along the PPy nanowires.\nThe generated gold nanoparticles were mainly dispersed on the surface of PPy nanowires. The oxidized PPy conducting polymeric chain has positive charge, and the charge must be balanced by the dopant (counter ion). The anion doping degree is significantly dependent on the solution pH. The PPy nanowires have less extraction ability in neutral solution than that in acidic medium. In sulfuric acid solution, the positively charged PPy nanowires can extract PtCl4 2\u2212 from the solution and embedded Pt nanoparticles in the nanowires matrix in the electroreduction process. In 0.1 M KCl neutral solution, lower AuCl4 \u2212 anions were entrapped into the polymeric matrix before electroreduction, which was unlike the situation for embedding Pt nanoparticles into the PPy nanowires in sulfuric acid. Furthermore, the existence of large amount of Cl\u2212 anions as the dopant can be extracted into the oxidized PPy conducting polymeric chain.\nThe composite has been further investigated by XPS determination. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the Au 4f spectrum consisting of two peaks appeared at 83.9 and 87.6 eV, corresponding to the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 components, respectively. This was consistent with a formation of metallic Au. The powder XRD analysis was used to demonstrate the formation of gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2B, four peaks appeared at 2\u03b8 of 38.3\u00b0, 44.5\u00b0, 64.7\u00b0 and 77.7\u00b0, which can be assigned to the diffractions of the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) structure, demonstrating the face-centered cubic metal gold structure was formed.\nIn order to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/PPy/GCE toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine, CVs were obtained in comparison with Au/GCE, PPy/GCE and bare GCE in the presence of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 M hydrazine, as shown in Fig. 3A. At bare GCE, only a very small oxidation peak current was observed at about 0.65 V (a). The CV obtained at PPy/GCE also presented a large overpotential with a very drown out peak at about 0.60 V (b), though the current response increased than that at bare GCE. A well-formed sharp catalytic oxidation peak at 0.181 V was observed at Au/GCE (c). The peak current was about five times of that at PPy/GCE. An even sharper catalytic peak appeared at 0.135 V at Au/PPy/GCE (d) and about 1.6-fold enhancement of peak current of that at Au/GCE. The overall about 515 mV negative shift of the peak potential indicated the catalytic activity of these electrodes is in the order of Au/PPy/GCE > Au/GCE > PPy/GCE > bare GCE. The increase of current response can be partly attributed to the increase of reversibility of the electron transfer (et) process, however, it may also generated from a surface accumulation of the electroactive species.\nSimilar behaviors were observed for the oxidation of hydroxylamine at these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3B. The oxidation peak appeared at 0.6, 0.5, 0.245 and 0.218 V at bare GCE (a), PPy/GCE (b), Au/GCE (c) and Au/PPy/GCE (d), respectively. The catalytic activity toward hydroxylamine oxidation at these electrodes was also in the same order for hydrazine. The peak current ratio can be estimated as 7:4:2.5:1 in the order. The comparisons reveal that the gold nanoparticles has much stronger catalytic activity toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine than the PPy nanowires, and the PPy nanowires supported gold nanoparticles have further enhanced catalytic activity. On the other hand, the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at low potentials, 0.135 and 0.218 V, are very useful for practical applications, since there are less risk for interference.\nThe scan rate effect was investigated in the range of 10\u2013400 mV s\u22121 at Au/PPy/GCE in 0.1 M PBS. The peak potential shifted slightly toward positive direction with increasing the scan rate. The peak current varied linearly with the square root of scan rate (v1/2),ipa(\u03bcA)=11.01+8.255v1/2(mV1/2s\u22121/2)(r=0.9996), showing a typical diffusion-controlled kinetics. The charge transfer coefficient (i.e. \u03b1) and the number of electrons involved in the rate-determining step can be evaluated. Based on the slope of E p versus log(v), (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u03b1 was calculated to be 0.48. If \u03b1 was assumed equal to 0.52, n \u03b1 was equaled to 1. Relating the value with the Tafel plot, the Tafel slope (b = 2.3RT/(1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u03b1 F) of 122 mV decade\u22121 was obtained, which was consistent with one electron transfer process in the rate-determining step.\nThe number of electrons (n) in the overall reaction can be obtained according to the following equation for a totally irreversible diffusion-controlled processes : Ip=3.01\u00d7105n[(1\u2212\u03b1)n\u03b1]1/2AcbD1/2v1/2 Considering D = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 (D was calculated from chronoamperometry), from the slope of I p versus v1/2 plot, n = 4 was estimated in the anodic oxidation of hydrazine.Similar results were obtained for hydroxylamine oxidation. The peak current was proportional to the square root of scan rate (v1/2),ipa(\u03bcA)=17.36+2.78v1/2(mV1/2s\u22121/2)(r=0.9995), suggesting a typical diffusion-controlled process. The Tafel slope of 124 mV decade\u22121 was observed, indicating one electron transfer involved in the rate-determining step. Assuming a transfer coefficient (\u03b1) of 0.53, the total number of electrons (n) involved in the oxidation of hydroxylamine was found to be 2.\nThe above results indicated that the overall electrochemical oxidations of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE were controlled by diffusion process of these species in bulk solution and the cross-exchange process between the species and the redox sites of the composite. Hydrazine is oxidized mainly through 4e\u2212 process with the final product N2 in aqueous solution. The overall oxidation of hydrazine at Au/PPy/GCE can be expressed as the following reaction: N2H5 + \u2192 N2 (g) + 5H+ + 4e\u2212\nThe mechanism of hydrazine oxidation depended significantly on the electrolyte solution and the nature of the electrodes. The 4e\u2212 oxidation demonstrated a perfect electrocatalytic mechanism was achieved at the 3D constructed nanocomposite modified electrode.\nAlthough the exact mechanism was hard to confirm , the first intermediate of hydrazine oxidation in aqueous solutions has been identified as the radical ion N2H4 + . The formation of N2H4 + ion was usually regarded as the rate-determining step, and other proposed intermediates are not stable . The catalytic current was dominated by the rate of electron exchange (k) between the redox sites of the composite and substrate. The value k can be evaluated using chronoamperometry based on the equation of I c/I d = (\u03c0kct)1/2, where I d is the diffusion limited current in the absence of hydrazine, I c is the catalytic current in the presence of hydrazine, and c is the bulk concentration. On the slope of the I c/I d versus t 1/2 plot, as shown in Fig. 4A, the value of k was estimated as 4.1 \u00d7 107 cm3/mol s for hydrazine. Considering the diffusion coefficient (D) 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 and the surface coverage (\u0393) 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol cm\u22122 for hydrazine, the average value of the catalytic rate constant in rate-determining step, k\u2032 (k\u2032 = k\u0393), was calculated as 9.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm s\u22121.\nThe 2e\u2212 oxidation of NH2OH to form N2O was forecasted at Au/PPy/GCE as shown in the following reaction: 2NH2OH + 4OH\u2212 \u2192 N2O + 5H2O + 4e\u2212 The value of k was evaluated to be 4.7 \u00d7 106 cm3/mol s according to the slope of the I c/I d versus t 1/2 plot, as shown in Fig. 4B. For the surface coverage (\u0393) 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol cm\u22122 and D = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 for hydroxylamine, we calculated a value of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm s\u22121 for k\u2032.\nChronoamperometry experiments were carried out at different concentrations of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE (not shown) for determination of the diffusion coefficient by setting the working electrode potential at 0.2 V. The diffusion coefficient was obtained according to the Cottrell equation : i=nFAD1/2c\u03c01/2t1/2 where D is diffusion coefficient (cm2 s\u22121) and c is the bulk concentration (mol cm\u22123).\nA calibration curve was recorded in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) containing various concentrations from 5 to 200 \u03bcM for hydrazine and 10 to 200 \u03bcM for hydroxylamine, respectively. The experimental plots of i versus t \u22121/2 with the best fit for different concentrations of hydrazine and hydroxylamine were employed, as shown in Fig. 5 . The slopes of the resulting straight lines were then plotted versus hydrazine and hydroxylamine concentrations (inset in Fig. 5A and B), respectively. From the slopes of the plot, the diffusion coefficients of hydrazine and hydroxylamine were calculated as 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 and 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121, respectively.\nThe thickness of PPy nanowires could influence the current response of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE. The catalytic peak current of hydrazine and hydroxylamine toward PPy thickness was investigated. The film thickness of the PPy nanowires can be controlled by varying the amount of charge passed the solution to the working electrode, considering the charge 24 mC cm\u22122 generated 100 nm thickness . The current response of hydrazine and hydroxylamine enhanced when the nanowires thickness increased from 0 to 60 nm, and then decreased gradually afterward. With increase the PPy nanowires thickness, gold nanoparticles tend to aggregate into larger particles. The thicker PPy film would further prevent the electron transfer between hydrazine or hydroxylamine and electrode. The optimum thickness of PPy nanowires was selected as 60 nm.\nThe optimized conditions for the deposition of gold nanoparticles on PPy nanowires have been investigated. Through changing the cycle number (N) in electrodeposition process, the amount and the size of the deposited gold nanoparticles can be controlled. The optimum current was obtained when N was 10. When N was below 10, the response currents of hydrazine and hydroxylamine increased with increasing of N, however, when N was above 10, the currents decreased gradually with further increasing N. On the other hand, the larger N may result larger gold nanostructures. The size of the nanoparticles significantly influenced the catalytic efficiency. Considering the results, 10 cycles was chosen as the optimum cycle number in gold electrodeposition process.\nThe oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine showed a strong dependence on pH, so pH should be optimized for their catalytic determination. Since the pK a of hydrazine is 7.9, below pH 7.9, hydrazine is protonated in the solution. Certainly, the catalytic peak current (i p) of hydrazine oxidation at Au/PPy/GCE was almost constant above pH 7, and reduced quickly with decreasing pH from 7 to 3, as shown in Fig. 6A. It was also found that the peak potential shifted positively along with the decrease of pH, indicating higher oxidation overpotential at lower pH.\nThe effect of pH value on hydroxylamine oxidation was also investigated. Hydroxylamine also present two forms, the nonprotonated form NH2OH for pH value higher than 5.9 and protonated form NH3OH+ at lower pH than 5.9. The protonated form is less active. The catalytic peak current (i p) of hydroxylamine oxidation increased with increasing pH from 4 to 7 and remained almost constant between 7 and 8, as shown in Fig. 6B. These phenomena are in agreement with the reaction equations (1) and (2), indicating that higher pH could promote the anodic oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. However, we also found that the current response of hydroxylamine decrease with pH increase from 8 to 10 (Fig. 6B), the mechanism of which may be complicated. Considering the practically applications, pH 7.0 PBS was chosen for determination.\nDPV technique was used for determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE in static solutions. The DPV gave a peak at 0.12 V for hydrazine (Fig. 7A) and 0.18 V for hydroxylamine (Fig. 7B), respectively. The plot of the peak current (i p) versus concentration of hydrazine was shown in Fig. 8A, which consisted of two linear segments, a current sensitivity of 126 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.0010\u20130.50 mM and 35.6 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.50\u20137.5 mM. The facts agree with the work previously reported , which may be attributed to the generation of N2 on the catalytic active sites and thus change the surface catalytic reaction conditions. At low hydrazine concentration, the formed N2 bubbles were little. We think that the N2 does not strongly adsorb at Au surface, and it could quickly dissolve into the solution and may not block the diffusion of hydrazine from the bulk solution. At high concentration of hydrazine, the N2 generated may form bubbles adhesive at the catalytic sites and inhibit the diffusion of new analyte molecules, in result of uncertainty of current response. However, we did not visually observe that N2 bubble from the electrode surface and the current response was reproducible with a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 2.9% for 10 repetitive determinations. The linear response obtained at low hydrazine concentrations can be used to construct a hydrazine sensor. The detection limit of hydrazine was found to be 0.20 \u03bcM.\nThe calibration curve for hydroxylamine was shown in Fig. 8B, which also consisted of two linear segments, a current sensitivity of 63.9 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.0010\u20130.50 mM and 10.4 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.50\u201318 mM. The detection limit of hydroxylamine was evaluated as 0.21 \u03bcM, according to the former calibration plot.\nThe analytical characteristics of the designed electrode were compared with those electrodes reported in the literature, as shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that the Au/PPy/GCE had the lowest detection limit, the highest current sensitivity and two linear regions covered the widest determination ranges, demonstrating the proposed electrode was superior.\nThe advantages of the Au/PPy/GCE can be generated from the composite structure formed by the conducting PPy nanowires and well-dispersed gold nanoparticles. The PPy nanowires with large pores can effectively transfer electrons between the GCE and gold active sites and support a three-dimensional (3D) gold nanoparticles matrix for electrocatalytic reaction, and thus increase the active surface area and the mass transportation rate, which can reduce the amount of oxidation products accumulated on the catalytic sites, preventing the electrode from fouling. Furthermore, the supporting PPy nanowires can finely disperse the gold nanoparticles and reduce the actual amount of gold per unit PPy surface area, which can reduce the congregating tendency.\nAs far as we known, the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine on the composite of PPy nanowires and metal nanoparticles have not been reported. The fabrication of metallic particles-conducting polymer matrix composite is also interesting in development of other sensors based on the electrocatalytic reactions.\nAn important problem in determining hydrazine and hydroxylamine is the presence of other electroactive nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrate, nitrite and ammonia, which often accompany with hydrazine and hydroxylamine in the process of the nitrogen cycle, as well as in a variety of industrial processes. The Au/PPy/GCE improved the selectivity and sensitivity through differently lowering the applied potential. The tolerance limit was defined as the molar ratio of the additive/hydrazine (hydroxylamine) causing less than 5% relative error for the determination of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 M hydrazine (or hydroxylamine). The results showed that 500-fold NO3 \u2212, NO2 \u2212, Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, F\u2212, I\u2212, HCO3 \u2212, PO4 3\u2212, CO3 2\u2212, SO4 2\u2212, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Fe2+ and Al3+, 200-fold glucose, sucrose, fructose, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and malic acid, 25-fold l-tyrosine, l-arginine and l-glutamic acid, 10-fold NH3 +, did not interfere with the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. Although hydrazine and hydroxylamine are electrocatalytically oxidized at different potentials, these potentials are not far enough to separate for simultaneous determination.\nThe stability of the Au/PPy/GCE was examined by monitoring the remained amount of current response after successive cycling the modified electrode in the potential range of \u22120.2 to 0.8 V in 0.1 M PBS for 500 circles. It was found that the peak current for hydrazine and hydroxylamine oxidation retained 96% of its initial value and no obvious potential shift was observed. On the other hand, the storage ability of Au/PPy/GCE was also examined. It was found that the current response to hydrazine and hydroxylamine was no apparent decrease in the first continuous 7 days by everyday use and stored in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) at 4 \u00b0C. Only 10% leakage was found after 1 month and 78% of its initial activity was reserved after 60 days. Under the selected conditions, the method showed the sensor had good reproducibility and long-term stability. The high stability of the modified electrode can be related to the PPy nanowires matrix, which increases the effective surface area and stabilizes the activity of gold nanoparticles.\nIn addition, a series of repetitive measurements were carried out in 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 M hydrazine and hydroxylamine solution to characterize the reproducibility of the sensor. A relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 3.5% and 3.9% for 20 replicate determinations for hydrazine and hydroxylamine was observed. This indicated that the modified electrode had excellent reproducibility and anti-fouling ability.\nA novel electrochemical sensor for determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine was fabricated by two electrodeposition steps: pre-synthesized 3D PPy nanowires matrix on GCE surface and electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on the PPy nanowires. The constructed Au/PPy/GCE exhibited a strongly electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. The modified electrode was used for sensitive determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine using DPV technique. The lower detection limit of hydrazine and hydroxylamine were estimated to be 0.20 and 0.21 \u03bcM, respectively. The Au/PPy/GCE had a good stability, reproducibility and anti-interference ability. In addition, the strategy of the combination of conducting PPy nanowires and gold nanoparticles showed significant advantages of synergic effect of organic and metallic nanoparticles composite for chemical and biochemical sensor construction.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

However, these methods had high detection limit and low precision, thus development of more sensitive and reliable method is necessary. Electroanalytical techniques were proven to be relatively direct and effective for the detection of hydrazine . Unfortunately, both of hydrazine and hydroxylamine exhibited irreversible oxidation required large overpotentials at bare carbon electrodes. Recently, various chemically modified electrodes (CMEs) have been prepared and applied in the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine , which can significantly lower the overpotentials and increase the oxidation current response.\nNoble metal nanoparticles have been extensively utilized in recent years, owing to their extraordinarily catalytic activities for both oxidation and reduction reactions. Due to the unique properties of gold nanoparticles, such as good conductivity, useful electrocatalytic ability and biocompatibility, several researchers have been devoted to fabricate electrochemical sensors and biosensors . The gold nanoparticles dispersed on various substrates have been reported, such as carbon paste electrode, self-assembled monolayer, conducting and non-conducting polymers. Among them, conducting polymers are suitable host matrices because they have advantages of permitting a facile electronic charge flow through the polymer matrix in electrochemical processes . Conducting polymers can provide not only low ohmic drops but also enhance the rate constant of electron transfer (et) process for some electroactive species. Polypyrrole (PPy) is one of most important organic conducting polymers, which have been found in wide applications in analytical chemistry. PPy nanowire has attracted much attention because of its well-ordered polymer chain structure with very high surface-to-volume ratio and small cross dimensions and highly electronic conductivity than ordinary PPy films.\nRecently, we have studied PPy nanowires and Pt nanoclusters composite for glucose determination, in which the electrochemically generated Pt nanoclusters were embedded in the PPy nanowires . In this paper, we investigated the synthesis of Au/PPy composite by a similar electrochemical method on glassy carbon electrode surface. The generated gold nanoparticles were not embedded in the PPy nanowires, but rather dispersed well on the surface of PPy nanowires in neutral electrodeposition solution. Through a suitable combination of PPy nanowires and gold nanoparticles, the Au/PPy composite can provide a porous structure with large effective surface area and highly electrocatalytic activities toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine.\nPyrrole was obtained from Aldrich and purified twice by distillation under the protection of high purity nitrogen and then kept in a refrigerator before use. Hydrazine, hydroxylamine and HAuCl4 were obtained from Chemical Reagent Company of Shanghai (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals were of analytical-reagent grade and used without further purification. Doubly distilled water and high purity N2 were used. The 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions of different pH values (PBSs) were prepared for the study. All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed on electrochemistry workstation CHI 660A (ChenHua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China). A conventional three-electrode system was used. A glassy carbon disk electrode (GCE, \u00d84.0 mm) was used as the basal electrode for fabrication. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire electrode were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode. DPV experiments were conducted at a scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121 under the instrumental conditions of 50 mV pulse amplitude, pulse width of 50 ms and pulse time of 200 ms.\nFE-SEM images of the electrode surfaces were obtained on JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microanalyser (FE-SEM) (JEOL, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB MK2 spectrometer (VG Co., UK) with Mg K\u03b1 radiation as the source for excitation. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on a MXPAHF rotating anode X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5).\nPrior to modification, the basal GCE was polished to a mirror finish using alumina slurries with different powder size down to 0.05 \u03bcm. After each polishing, the electrode was sonicated in ethanol and doubly distilled water for 5 min, successively, in order to remove any adsorbed substances on the electrode surface. Finally, it was dried under nitrogen atmosphere ready for use.\nThe synthesized polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire was fabricated according to the previous work . The PPy was electrochemically deposited at a constant potential of 0.80 V for 120 s in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.1 M carbonate containing 0.15 M pyrrole. The electrode was then transferred into 0.1 M HClO4 solution for 12 h aging. The PPy nanowires modified electrode was obtained and denoted as PPy/GCE.\nThe gold nanoparticles was electrochemically deposited on the prepared PPy/GCE by CV scanning from 0.2 V to \u22121.0 V in 0.1 M KCl solution containing 0.5 mM HAuCl4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121 for 10 cycles. The generated Au/PPy composite modified electrode was obtained and denoted as Au/PPy/GCE. An individual Au modified GCE, denoted as Au/GCE, was similarly prepared for comparison.\nFE-SEM images of the synthesized PPy nanowires matrix and the Au/PPy nanocomposite on GCE were shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1A shows the image of deposited PPy nanowire matrix, which is a sponge-like nano-matrix consisted of PPy nanowires of about 60 nm in diameter. Fig. 1B shows the morphology of the Au/PPy composite, in which the CV deposition of gold nanoparticle of about 15 nm in diameter is attached on the surface and aligned along the PPy nanowires.\nThe generated gold nanoparticles were mainly dispersed on the surface of PPy nanowires. The oxidized PPy conducting polymeric chain has positive charge, and the charge must be balanced by the dopant (counter ion). The anion doping degree is significantly dependent on the solution pH. The PPy nanowires have less extraction ability in neutral solution than that in acidic medium. In sulfuric acid solution, the positively charged PPy nanowires can extract PtCl4 2\u2212 from the solution and embedded Pt nanoparticles in the nanowires matrix in the electroreduction process. In 0.1 M KCl neutral solution, lower AuCl4 \u2212 anions were entrapped into the polymeric matrix before electroreduction, which was unlike the situation for embedding Pt nanoparticles into the PPy nanowires in sulfuric acid. Furthermore, the existence of large amount of Cl\u2212 anions as the dopant can be extracted into the oxidized PPy conducting polymeric chain.\nThe composite has been further investigated by XPS determination. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the Au 4f spectrum consisting of two peaks appeared at 83.9 and 87.6 eV, corresponding to the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 components, respectively. This was consistent with a formation of metallic Au. The powder XRD analysis was used to demonstrate the formation of gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2B, four peaks appeared at 2\u03b8 of 38.3\u00b0, 44.5\u00b0, 64.7\u00b0 and 77.7\u00b0, which can be assigned to the diffractions of the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) structure, demonstrating the face-centered cubic metal gold structure was formed.\nIn order to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/PPy/GCE toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine, CVs were obtained in comparison with Au/GCE, PPy/GCE and bare GCE in the presence of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 M hydrazine, as shown in Fig. 3A. At bare GCE, only a very small oxidation peak current was observed at about 0.65 V (a). The CV obtained at PPy/GCE also presented a large overpotential with a very drown out peak at about 0.60 V (b), though the current response increased than that at bare GCE. A well-formed sharp catalytic oxidation peak at 0.181 V was observed at Au/GCE (c). The peak current was about five times of that at PPy/GCE. An even sharper catalytic peak appeared at 0.135 V at Au/PPy/GCE (d) and about 1.6-fold enhancement of peak current of that at Au/GCE. The overall about 515 mV negative shift of the peak potential indicated the catalytic activity of these electrodes is in the order of Au/PPy/GCE > Au/GCE > PPy/GCE > bare GCE. The increase of current response can be partly attributed to the increase of reversibility of the electron transfer (et) process, however, it may also generated from a surface accumulation of the electroactive species.\nSimilar behaviors were observed for the oxidation of hydroxylamine at these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3B. The oxidation peak appeared at 0.6, 0.5, 0.245 and 0.218 V at bare GCE (a), PPy/GCE (b), Au/GCE (c) and Au/PPy/GCE (d), respectively. The catalytic activity toward hydroxylamine oxidation at these electrodes was also in the same order for hydrazine. The peak current ratio can be estimated as 7:4:2.5:1 in the order. The comparisons reveal that the gold nanoparticles has much stronger catalytic activity toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine than the PPy nanowires, and the PPy nanowires supported gold nanoparticles have further enhanced catalytic activity. On the other hand, the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at low potentials, 0.135 and 0.218 V, are very useful for practical applications, since there are less risk for interference.\nThe scan rate effect was investigated in the range of 10\u2013400 mV s\u22121 at Au/PPy/GCE in 0.1 M PBS. The peak potential shifted slightly toward positive direction with increasing the scan rate. The peak current varied linearly with the square root of scan rate (v1/2),ipa(\u03bcA)=11.01+8.255v1/2(mV1/2s\u22121/2)(r=0.9996), showing a typical diffusion-controlled kinetics. The charge transfer coefficient (i.e. \u03b1) and the number of electrons involved in the rate-determining step can be evaluated. Based on the slope of E p versus log(v), (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u03b1 was calculated to be 0.48. If \u03b1 was assumed equal to 0.52, n \u03b1 was equaled to 1. Relating the value with the Tafel plot, the Tafel slope (b = 2.3RT/(1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u03b1 F) of 122 mV decade\u22121 was obtained, which was consistent with one electron transfer process in the rate-determining step.\nThe number of electrons (n) in the overall reaction can be obtained according to the following equation for a totally irreversible diffusion-controlled processes : Ip=3.01\u00d7105n[(1\u2212\u03b1)n\u03b1]1/2AcbD1/2v1/2 Considering D = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 (D was calculated from chronoamperometry), from the slope of I p versus v1/2 plot, n = 4 was estimated in the anodic oxidation of hydrazine.Similar results were obtained for hydroxylamine oxidation. The peak current was proportional to the square root of scan rate (v1/2),ipa(\u03bcA)=17.36+2.78v1/2(mV1/2s\u22121/2)(r=0.9995), suggesting a typical diffusion-controlled process. The Tafel slope of 124 mV decade\u22121 was observed, indicating one electron transfer involved in the rate-determining step. Assuming a transfer coefficient (\u03b1) of 0.53, the total number of electrons (n) involved in the oxidation of hydroxylamine was found to be 2.\nThe above results indicated that the overall electrochemical oxidations of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE were controlled by diffusion process of these species in bulk solution and the cross-exchange process between the species and the redox sites of the composite. Hydrazine is oxidized mainly through 4e\u2212 process with the final product N2 in aqueous solution. The overall oxidation of hydrazine at Au/PPy/GCE can be expressed as the following reaction: N2H5 + \u2192 N2 (g) + 5H+ + 4e\u2212\nThe mechanism of hydrazine oxidation depended significantly on the electrolyte solution and the nature of the electrodes. The 4e\u2212 oxidation demonstrated a perfect electrocatalytic mechanism was achieved at the 3D constructed nanocomposite modified electrode.\nAlthough the exact mechanism was hard to confirm , the first intermediate of hydrazine oxidation in aqueous solutions has been identified as the radical ion N2H4 + . The formation of N2H4 + ion was usually regarded as the rate-determining step, and other proposed intermediates are not stable . The catalytic current was dominated by the rate of electron exchange (k) between the redox sites of the composite and substrate. The value k can be evaluated using chronoamperometry based on the equation of I c/I d = (\u03c0kct)1/2, where I d is the diffusion limited current in the absence of hydrazine, I c is the catalytic current in the presence of hydrazine, and c is the bulk concentration. On the slope of the I c/I d versus t 1/2 plot, as shown in Fig. 4A, the value of k was estimated as 4.1 \u00d7 107 cm3/mol s for hydrazine. Considering the diffusion coefficient (D) 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 and the surface coverage (\u0393) 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol cm\u22122 for hydrazine, the average value of the catalytic rate constant in rate-determining step, k\u2032 (k\u2032 = k\u0393), was calculated as 9.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm s\u22121.\nThe 2e\u2212 oxidation of NH2OH to form N2O was forecasted at Au/PPy/GCE as shown in the following reaction: 2NH2OH + 4OH\u2212 \u2192 N2O + 5H2O + 4e\u2212 The value of k was evaluated to be 4.7 \u00d7 106 cm3/mol s according to the slope of the I c/I d versus t 1/2 plot, as shown in Fig. 4B. For the surface coverage (\u0393) 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol cm\u22122 and D = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 for hydroxylamine, we calculated a value of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm s\u22121 for k\u2032.\nChronoamperometry experiments were carried out at different concentrations of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE (not shown) for determination of the diffusion coefficient by setting the working electrode potential at 0.2 V. The diffusion coefficient was obtained according to the Cottrell equation : i=nFAD1/2c\u03c01/2t1/2 where D is diffusion coefficient (cm2 s\u22121) and c is the bulk concentration (mol cm\u22123).\nA calibration curve was recorded in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) containing various concentrations from 5 to 200 \u03bcM for hydrazine and 10 to 200 \u03bcM for hydroxylamine, respectively. The experimental plots of i versus t \u22121/2 with the best fit for different concentrations of hydrazine and hydroxylamine were employed, as shown in Fig. 5 . The slopes of the resulting straight lines were then plotted versus hydrazine and hydroxylamine concentrations (inset in Fig. 5A and B), respectively. From the slopes of the plot, the diffusion coefficients of hydrazine and hydroxylamine were calculated as 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 and 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121, respectively.\nThe thickness of PPy nanowires could influence the current response of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE. The catalytic peak current of hydrazine and hydroxylamine toward PPy thickness was investigated. The film thickness of the PPy nanowires can be controlled by varying the amount of charge passed the solution to the working electrode, considering the charge 24 mC cm\u22122 generated 100 nm thickness . The current response of hydrazine and hydroxylamine enhanced when the nanowires thickness increased from 0 to 60 nm, and then decreased gradually afterward. With increase the PPy nanowires thickness, gold nanoparticles tend to aggregate into larger particles. The thicker PPy film would further prevent the electron transfer between hydrazine or hydroxylamine and electrode. The optimum thickness of PPy nanowires was selected as 60 nm.\nThe optimized conditions for the deposition of gold nanoparticles on PPy nanowires have been investigated. Through changing the cycle number (N) in electrodeposition process, the amount and the size of the deposited gold nanoparticles can be controlled. The optimum current was obtained when N was 10. When N was below 10, the response currents of hydrazine and hydroxylamine increased with increasing of N, however, when N was above 10, the currents decreased gradually with further increasing N. On the other hand, the larger N may result larger gold nanostructures. The size of the nanoparticles significantly influenced the catalytic efficiency. Considering the results, 10 cycles was chosen as the optimum cycle number in gold electrodeposition process.\nThe oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine showed a strong dependence on pH, so pH should be optimized for their catalytic determination. Since the pK a of hydrazine is 7.9, below pH 7.9, hydrazine is protonated in the solution. Certainly, the catalytic peak current (i p) of hydrazine oxidation at Au/PPy/GCE was almost constant above pH 7, and reduced quickly with decreasing pH from 7 to 3, as shown in Fig. 6A. It was also found that the peak potential shifted positively along with the decrease of pH, indicating higher oxidation overpotential at lower pH.\nThe effect of pH value on hydroxylamine oxidation was also investigated. Hydroxylamine also present two forms, the nonprotonated form NH2OH for pH value higher than 5.9 and protonated form NH3OH+ at lower pH than 5.9. The protonated form is less active. The catalytic peak current (i p) of hydroxylamine oxidation increased with increasing pH from 4 to 7 and remained almost constant between 7 and 8, as shown in Fig. 6B. These phenomena are in agreement with the reaction equations (1) and (2), indicating that higher pH could promote the anodic oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. However, we also found that the current response of hydroxylamine decrease with pH increase from 8 to 10 (Fig. 6B), the mechanism of which may be complicated. Considering the practically applications, pH 7.0 PBS was chosen for determination.\nDPV technique was used for determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine at Au/PPy/GCE in static solutions. The DPV gave a peak at 0.12 V for hydrazine (Fig. 7A) and 0.18 V for hydroxylamine (Fig. 7B), respectively. The plot of the peak current (i p) versus concentration of hydrazine was shown in Fig. 8A, which consisted of two linear segments, a current sensitivity of 126 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.0010\u20130.50 mM and 35.6 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.50\u20137.5 mM. The facts agree with the work previously reported , which may be attributed to the generation of N2 on the catalytic active sites and thus change the surface catalytic reaction conditions. At low hydrazine concentration, the formed N2 bubbles were little. We think that the N2 does not strongly adsorb at Au surface, and it could quickly dissolve into the solution and may not block the diffusion of hydrazine from the bulk solution. At high concentration of hydrazine, the N2 generated may form bubbles adhesive at the catalytic sites and inhibit the diffusion of new analyte molecules, in result of uncertainty of current response. However, we did not visually observe that N2 bubble from the electrode surface and the current response was reproducible with a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 2.9% for 10 repetitive determinations. The linear response obtained at low hydrazine concentrations can be used to construct a hydrazine sensor. The detection limit of hydrazine was found to be 0.20 \u03bcM.\nThe calibration curve for hydroxylamine was shown in Fig. 8B, which also consisted of two linear segments, a current sensitivity of 63.9 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.0010\u20130.50 mM and 10.4 \u03bcA mM\u22121 in the range of 0.50\u201318 mM. The detection limit of hydroxylamine was evaluated as 0.21 \u03bcM, according to the former calibration plot.\nThe analytical characteristics of the designed electrode were compared with those electrodes reported in the literature, as shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that the Au/PPy/GCE had the lowest detection limit, the highest current sensitivity and two linear regions covered the widest determination ranges, demonstrating the proposed electrode was superior.\nThe advantages of the Au/PPy/GCE can be generated from the composite structure formed by the conducting PPy nanowires and well-dispersed gold nanoparticles. The PPy nanowires with large pores can effectively transfer electrons between the GCE and gold active sites and support a three-dimensional (3D) gold nanoparticles matrix for electrocatalytic reaction, and thus increase the active surface area and the mass transportation rate, which can reduce the amount of oxidation products accumulated on the catalytic sites, preventing the electrode from fouling. Furthermore, the supporting PPy nanowires can finely disperse the gold nanoparticles and reduce the actual amount of gold per unit PPy surface area, which can reduce the congregating tendency.\nAs far as we known, the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine on the composite of PPy nanowires and metal nanoparticles have not been reported. The fabrication of metallic particles-conducting polymer matrix composite is also interesting in development of other sensors based on the electrocatalytic reactions.\nAn important problem in determining hydrazine and hydroxylamine is the presence of other electroactive nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrate, nitrite and ammonia, which often accompany with hydrazine and hydroxylamine in the process of the nitrogen cycle, as well as in a variety of industrial processes. The Au/PPy/GCE improved the selectivity and sensitivity through differently lowering the applied potential. The tolerance limit was defined as the molar ratio of the additive/hydrazine (hydroxylamine) causing less than 5% relative error for the determination of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 M hydrazine (or hydroxylamine). The results showed that 500-fold NO3 \u2212, NO2 \u2212, Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, F\u2212, I\u2212, HCO3 \u2212, PO4 3\u2212, CO3 2\u2212, SO4 2\u2212, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Fe2+ and Al3+, 200-fold glucose, sucrose, fructose, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and malic acid, 25-fold l-tyrosine, l-arginine and l-glutamic acid, 10-fold NH3 +, did not interfere with the determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. Although hydrazine and hydroxylamine are electrocatalytically oxidized at different potentials, these potentials are not far enough to separate for simultaneous determination.\nThe stability of the Au/PPy/GCE was examined by monitoring the remained amount of current response after successive cycling the modified electrode in the potential range of \u22120.2 to 0.8 V in 0.1 M PBS for 500 circles. It was found that the peak current for hydrazine and hydroxylamine oxidation retained 96% of its initial value and no obvious potential shift was observed. On the other hand, the storage ability of Au/PPy/GCE was also examined. It was found that the current response to hydrazine and hydroxylamine was no apparent decrease in the first continuous 7 days by everyday use and stored in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) at 4 \u00b0C. Only 10% leakage was found after 1 month and 78% of its initial activity was reserved after 60 days. Under the selected conditions, the method showed the sensor had good reproducibility and long-term stability. The high stability of the modified electrode can be related to the PPy nanowires matrix, which increases the effective surface area and stabilizes the activity of gold nanoparticles.\nIn addition, a series of repetitive measurements were carried out in 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 M hydrazine and hydroxylamine solution to characterize the reproducibility of the sensor. A relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 3.5% and 3.9% for 20 replicate determinations for hydrazine and hydroxylamine was observed. This indicated that the modified electrode had excellent reproducibility and anti-fouling ability.\nA novel electrochemical sensor for determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine was fabricated by two electrodeposition steps: pre-synthesized 3D PPy nanowires matrix on GCE surface and electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on the PPy nanowires. The constructed Au/PPy/GCE exhibited a strongly electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine. The modified electrode was used for sensitive determination of hydrazine and hydroxylamine using DPV technique. The lower detection limit of hydrazine and hydroxylamine were estimated to be 0.20 and 0.21 \u03bcM, respectively. The Au/PPy/GCE had a good stability, reproducibility and anti-interference ability. In addition, the strategy of the combination of conducting PPy nanowires and gold nanoparticles showed significant advantages of synergic effect of organic and metallic nanoparticles composite for chemical and biochemical sensor construction."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nHydrazine is a common building block and reagent for the manufacture of drug substance . However, hydrazine is a known genotoxic compound . According to EMEA's guidelines, the intake of hydrazine impurity must be controlled to no greater than 1.5 \u03bcg/day when a drug is taken for more than 12 months . Thus depending on the daily dose, the level of hydrazine in drug substance must be controlled at low ppm levels. For instance, hydrazine is controlled and monitored at 1 ppm in Povidone and Copovidone . Such a low limit poses tremendous challenges not only to the manufacturing process but also to the analytical method.\nMany methods have been developed for the analysis of hydrazine. Direct analysis of hydrazine in an investigational drug was reported using ion chromatography coupled with electrochemical detector with a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 100 ppm . The majority of the analytical methods, however, are based on detection of hydrazine derivatives which are analyzed by TLC , HPLC , GC , or GC\u2013MS techniques. Kean et al. recently gave an excellent review on the subject , thus the reported analytical methods will not be discussed in details herein. Detecting trace hydrazine in drug substances is challenging because of the potential interferences caused by large amounts of drug substance and its impurities. Furthermore, the large amount of drug substance makes the analysis of the derivatives by direct injection GC impractical because very often methods suffer from robustness issues due to contamination, i.e., limited number of injections can be made and frequent instrument cleaning are required. For HPLC related methods, on the other hand, the separation of drug substance (or impurities) and the hydrazine derivative may have to be optimized for each individual drug substance which can be difficult to achieve sometimes. As Kean et al. alluded to in the article, there is an obvious need to develop a generic method that can be used to detect hydrazine in various drug substances .\nHeadspace GC is a common technique in pharmaceutical analysis and has been routinely used for the analysis of volatiles in drug substance . Headspace is discriminatory in nature since only the volatiles in the injection vials can be transferred to the GC system while the non-volatile interferences (drug substance and impurities) will remain in the headspace injection vials. Thus higher sample loading is possible without significant adverse effects to the analysis. It is well known that hydrazine reacts with acetone producing acetone azine (Scheme 1a) , of which the boiling point is 133 \u00b0C/763 mmHg. Thus it is possible to analyze acetone azine with a headspace GC technique. In this report, hydrazine was analyzed by headspace GC\u2013MS after in situ derivatization with acetone. A low LOQ of 0.1 ppm (w/w) was achieved. Since acetone is sometimes used as a solvent in the manufacture process of drug substances, the derivatization product, acetone azine, may be present in drug substance prior to derivatization. In an effort to differentiate hydrazine from pre-existing acetone azine, acetone-d6 was also explored as an alternative reagent to acetone. (Scheme 1b).\nBenzoic acid (ACS reagent), acetone (HPLC grade), acetone-d6 (99.9%, atom% D), and hydrazine monohydrate (98%) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA, Ultrapure) was obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, HPLC grade) was purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Morristown, NJ, USA). Water used in the experiment was purified by an in-house Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Helium (99.996%) and nitrogen (99.999%) were obtained from PRAXAIR (Bethlehem, PA, USA). All drug substances used for validation and testing were obtained from projects at GlaxoSmithKline and prepared in house. For proprietary reasons, all codes of drug substance are masked.\nThe analysis was carried out using an Agilent GC\u2013MS system (Palo Alto, CA, USA) consisting of a 6890A GC, a 5973N Mass Detector and a CTC Combi-Pal autosampler. The headspace autosampler conditions are: incubation oven temperature 100 \u00b0C; incubation time 10 min; headspace syringe temperature 110 \u00b0C; agitation speed 500 rpm; agitation on time 18 s; agitation off time 2 s; injection volume 500 \u03bcL; fill speed 100 \u03bcL/s; syringe pull-up delay 300 ms; injection speed 1 mL/s; pre-injection delay 2 s; post injection delay 100 ms; syringe flush 5 min with nitrogen. An Agilent DB-624 (25 m \u00d7 0.2 mm i.d. \u00d7 1.12 \u03bcm) GC column was used. The oven temperature gradient started at 100 \u00b0C for 6 min and then ramped to 220 \u00b0C at 50 \u00b0C/min and held for 2 min at 220 \u00b0C. A 4 mm i.d. liner containing glass wool was used. Helium was used as carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The injector temperature was kept at 200 \u00b0C in split mode (5:1). The mass detector was operated in electron impact mode (70 eV). The source temperature and quad temperature were set to 230 and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. The MSD transfer line temperature was set at 230 \u00b0C. The derivatization products of hydrazine were monitored in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode with a dwell time of 200 ms. The data were only collected between 3.0 and 6.0 min. For the acetone derivative, the molecular ion at m/z 112 was monitored while for the acetone-d6 derivative, both ions at m/z 124 and m/z 106 were monitored for best results.\nThe derivatization reagent was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of benzoic acid and 0.5 mL of acetone or acetone-d6 in 10 mL NMP. The stock solution of hydrazine was prepared at approximately 1 mg/mL in the diluent of aqueous EDTA (0.1%). For linearity validation, the stock solution of hydrazine was diluted using the diluent to give standards at 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, and 10 \u03bcg/mL, which correspond to 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, and 10 ppm (relative to 10 mg API free base), respectively. The API samples were typically prepared by weighing approximately 10 mg API into a 10-mL headspace GC injection vial, followed by adding 100 \u03bcL of derivatization reagent and 10 \u03bcL of diluent. The solutions used for method recovery tests were prepared similarly, except that 10 \u03bcL working standard solution instead of the diluent was added. The prepared samples were analyzed directly without further treatment.\nThe acetone derivatization approach has been used for the analysis of hydrazine in air and water in which the derivatization product, acetone azine, was detected by direct injection GC methods. The approach has not been adopted for pharmaceutical analysis due to the presence of large amount of non-volatile sample matrices, API. Although, the direct injection GC approach is amenable to environmental analysis applications, it is prone to severe contamination issues in pharmaceutical analysis due to the presence of high concentration of API. Because of the moderate boiling point of the derivatization product, acetone azine, it is feasible to convert the direct injection approach to more selective and robust headspace GC\u2013MS method.\nHydrazine reacts with acetone or acetone-d6 producing acetone azine or acetone azine-d12, respectively. In EI-MS analysis, acetone azine produced major ions at m/z 56, m/z 97, and m/z 112, and acetone azine-d12 produced major ions at m/z 62, m/z 106, and m/z 124 (Fig. 1 ). The derivatization reaction is driven to completion during headspace incubation. NMP is an excellent solvent, since most tested APIs dissolved completely before incubation. For certain very hydrophobic API substances, the sample solution became homogenous during incubation. Incubation times of 5, 10 and 15 min were tested and no significant difference was observed, thus an incubation time of 10 min was selected. Acetone and acetone-d6 are more volatile than the azines, and thus may compete with acetone azine or acetone azine-d12 for vaporization in headspace injection vials. Therefore, the concentration of acetone in the derivatization reagent solution must be minimized. It was optimized by examining the concentrations at 5%, 10% and 20% (v/v). No significant effect on hydrazine sensitivity was observed for the 1 ppm standard. However, the acetone concentration had a great impact on the precision of the method. The %RSD of 6 preparations at 1 ppm was 2.6%, 9.7%, and 23.1% respectively for acetone concentrations of 5%, 10% and 20%. The higher acetone concentration gave the worse injection precision. As a result, 5% acetone was selected. Benzoic acid, another additive in the derivatization reagent solution, helped increase the response of hydrazine by about 40%, but the mechanism is not clear. It may catalyze the derivatization reaction or facilitate the vaporization of acetone azine from NMP solution. Non-volatile EDTA was added into the diluent for standard solutions to prevent transition metal promoted autoxidation of hydrazine . The additives exerted no chromatographic effects on the analytes. The separation of the hydrazine derivatization product from other interferences can be easily achieved. Typical chromatograms are shown in Fig. 2 .\nThe linearity, LOQ, precision, and spike recovery (accuracy) of the method were evaluated, and the validation results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . A linear range from 0.1 to 10 ppm (relative to 10 mg API in a headspace injection vial) was demonstrated for both derivatization reagents with R 2 \u2265 0.999 (Table 1). Based on the S/N ratio of the lowest concentration of the standard, the LOQ for hydrazine could be as low as 0.1 ppm. The method uses 10 mg API for each analysis, but if desired, lower LOQ could be achieved by using higher API loading. The precision of hydrazine analysis of the standard at the 1 ppm level is typically between 2.7% and 5.6%. Typical spike recoveries of hydrazine were in the range of 79\u2013117% (Table 2) at 1 ppm except entries 6 and 7, which were performed at 25 and 100 ppm respectively with modified methods due to the higher control limits required by the projects. The relatively low recovery (79%) of hydrazine in GSK966XXX may be attributed to the reaction of hydrazine with API, which is a weak Michael acceptor. Some of the APIs tested contains reactive functional groups such as ketone, primary amine, or even Michael acceptor which may react with hydrazine and acetone respectively. Also the APIs vary in form from free base to HCl salts and fumarate salts. These experiments demonstrated that the effect of API on the recovery is not significant. The chromatograms of two actual samples are presented in Fig. 3 to demonstrate the application of the strategy.

        "txt": "Hydrazine is a common building block and reagent for the manufacture of drug substance . However, hydrazine is a known genotoxic compound . According to EMEA's guidelines, the intake of hydrazine impurity must be controlled to no greater than 1.5 \u03bcg/day when a drug is taken for more than 12 months . Thus depending on the daily dose, the level of hydrazine in drug substance must be controlled at low ppm levels. For instance, hydrazine is controlled and monitored at 1 ppm in Povidone and Copovidone . Such a low limit poses tremendous challenges not only to the manufacturing process but also to the analytical method.\nMany methods have been developed for the analysis of hydrazine. Direct analysis of hydrazine in an investigational drug was reported using ion chromatography coupled with electrochemical detector with a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 100 ppm . The majority of the analytical methods, however, are based on detection of hydrazine derivatives which are analyzed by TLC , HPLC , GC , or GC\u2013MS techniques. Kean et al. recently gave an excellent review on the subject , thus the reported analytical methods will not be discussed in details herein. Detecting trace hydrazine in drug substances is challenging because of the potential interferences caused by large amounts of drug substance and its impurities. Furthermore, the large amount of drug substance makes the analysis of the derivatives by direct injection GC impractical because very often methods suffer from robustness issues due to contamination, i.e., limited number of injections can be made and frequent instrument cleaning are required. For HPLC related methods, on the other hand, the separation of drug substance (or impurities) and the hydrazine derivative may have to be optimized for each individual drug substance which can be difficult to achieve sometimes. As Kean et al. alluded to in the article, there is an obvious need to develop a generic method that can be used to detect hydrazine in various drug substances .\nHeadspace GC is a common technique in pharmaceutical analysis and has been routinely used for the analysis of volatiles in drug substance . Headspace is discriminatory in nature since only the volatiles in the injection vials can be transferred to the GC system while the non-volatile interferences (drug substance and impurities) will remain in the headspace injection vials. Thus higher sample loading is possible without significant adverse effects to the analysis. It is well known that hydrazine reacts with acetone producing acetone azine (Scheme 1a) , of which the boiling point is 133 \u00b0C/763 mmHg. Thus it is possible to analyze acetone azine with a headspace GC technique. In this report, hydrazine was analyzed by headspace GC\u2013MS after in situ derivatization with acetone. A low LOQ of 0.1 ppm (w/w) was achieved. Since acetone is sometimes used as a solvent in the manufacture process of drug substances, the derivatization product, acetone azine, may be present in drug substance prior to derivatization. In an effort to differentiate hydrazine from pre-existing acetone azine, acetone-d6 was also explored as an alternative reagent to acetone. (Scheme 1b).\nBenzoic acid (ACS reagent), acetone (HPLC grade), acetone-d6 (99.9%, atom% D), and hydrazine monohydrate (98%) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA, Ultrapure) was obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, HPLC grade) was purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Morristown, NJ, USA). Water used in the experiment was purified by an in-house Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Helium (99.996%) and nitrogen (99.999%) were obtained from PRAXAIR (Bethlehem, PA, USA). All drug substances used for validation and testing were obtained from projects at GlaxoSmithKline and prepared in house. For proprietary reasons, all codes of drug substance are masked.\nThe analysis was carried out using an Agilent GC\u2013MS system (Palo Alto, CA, USA) consisting of a 6890A GC, a 5973N Mass Detector and a CTC Combi-Pal autosampler. The headspace autosampler conditions are: incubation oven temperature 100 \u00b0C; incubation time 10 min; headspace syringe temperature 110 \u00b0C; agitation speed 500 rpm; agitation on time 18 s; agitation off time 2 s; injection volume 500 \u03bcL; fill speed 100 \u03bcL/s; syringe pull-up delay 300 ms; injection speed 1 mL/s; pre-injection delay 2 s; post injection delay 100 ms; syringe flush 5 min with nitrogen. An Agilent DB-624 (25 m \u00d7 0.2 mm i.d. \u00d7 1.12 \u03bcm) GC column was used. The oven temperature gradient started at 100 \u00b0C for 6 min and then ramped to 220 \u00b0C at 50 \u00b0C/min and held for 2 min at 220 \u00b0C. A 4 mm i.d. liner containing glass wool was used. Helium was used as carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The injector temperature was kept at 200 \u00b0C in split mode (5:1). The mass detector was operated in electron impact mode (70 eV). The source temperature and quad temperature were set to 230 and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. The MSD transfer line temperature was set at 230 \u00b0C. The derivatization products of hydrazine were monitored in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode with a dwell time of 200 ms.

For the acetone derivative, the molecular ion at m/z 112 was monitored while for the acetone-d6 derivative, both ions at m/z 124 and m/z 106 were monitored for best results.\nThe derivatization reagent was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of benzoic acid and 0.5 mL of acetone or acetone-d6 in 10 mL NMP. The stock solution of hydrazine was prepared at approximately 1 mg/mL in the diluent of aqueous EDTA (0.1%). For linearity validation, the stock solution of hydrazine was diluted using the diluent to give standards at 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, and 10 \u03bcg/mL, which correspond to 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, and 10 ppm (relative to 10 mg API free base), respectively. The API samples were typically prepared by weighing approximately 10 mg API into a 10-mL headspace GC injection vial, followed by adding 100 \u03bcL of derivatization reagent and 10 \u03bcL of diluent. The solutions used for method recovery tests were prepared similarly, except that 10 \u03bcL working standard solution instead of the diluent was added.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nAll mycotoxins are low-molecular weight substances produced as secondary metabolites by various molds . By definition, mycotoxins are poisonous to vertebrates in low concentrations. Numerous Fusarium species, such as Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium poae, Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium verticillioides belong to the most prevalent molds in temperate climatic regions . Fusarium species can occur on a broad range of hosts, including barley, maize, millet, oat, rice, rye and wheat . Trichothecenes and zearalenone are major Fusarium mycotoxins . The trichothecenes are polycyclic sesquiterpenoids, possessing a C-9,10 double bond, a C-12,13-epoxide ring, and various hydroxyl and acetoxy groups. According to their characteristic functional groups, trichothecenes can be grouped into four types (A\u2013D). Type-A trichothecenes have an oxygen function at C-8, which is different from a keto-group. Members of this group include the highly toxic HT-2 toxin (HT-2), T-2 toxin (T-2) and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS). The type-B trichothecenes, such as nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), fusarenon X (FUS-X), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalneol (3ADON) and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15ADON), possess a C-8 keto-group. Type C trichothecenes are characterized by a second epoxide-group, while type D trichothecenes are macrocyclic compounds. Chemical structures of the Fusarium mycotoxins investigated in the present paper are shown in Fig. 1 . Acute and chronic ingestion by humans and animals can elicit a variety of toxic effects, including fever, diarrhea, vomiting, necrosis, hemorrhage and depletion of bone marrow . Maximum tolerated levels for DON, the most commonly detected type-B trichothecene, in food commodities are usually in the range from 500 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg .\nAnalytical methods for the determination of trichothecenes have been reviewed . For the determination of type A-trichothecenes analytical methods using GC with electron capture detection (ECD), GC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS for the chromatographic separation and detection are described. The most common methods for the determination of type B-trichothecenes include GC\u2013ECD, GC\u2013MS, LC\u2013UV, LC with either pre or post column derivatisation and fluorescence detection (FLD), LC\u2013MS and recently also LC\u2013MS/MS . There are also methods capable of determining both type A- and B-trichothecenes simultaneously, using GC\u2013ECD, GC\u2013MS, LC\u2013MS or LC\u2013MS/MS . Clean-up of sample extracts for the determination of trichothecenes in cereals is frequently done by MycoSep\u00ae #227 columns, which have also been successfully applied in several LC\u2013MS methods .\nZearalenone, 6-(10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl)-\u03b2-resorcyclic acid \u03bc-lactone, is a Fusarium metabolite with potent estrogenic activity . Maximum tolerated or guideline levels for ZON in food are ranging from 30 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg . Analytical methods for the determination of ZON have also been reviewed . TLC and GC methods are available, but ZON is usually determined either by LC\u2013FLD, by LC\u2013MS or by LC\u2013MS/MS . MycoSep\u00ae #226 columns were used for LC\u2013MS analysis of ZON in a method by Rosenberg et al. .\nThe development of multimycotoxin methods, allowing to detect and determine several groups of co-occurring mycotoxins with single chromatographic runs, is highly desirable. Frisvad and Thrane did pioneer work in this field as early as 1987 using LC\u2013UV . The complex composition of food and feed matrices as well as the wide range of physical and chemical properties of mycotoxins require selective and sensitive detection techniques, such as mass spectrometry, especially for multitoxin methods. In the field of Fusarium mycotoxins there are some GC\u2013MS methods for the simultaneous determination of trichothecenes and ZON . However, the need to derivatise the samples prior to GC analysis and the huge technical improvements in the field of LC\u2013MS have increased the number of methods using LC\u2013MS. Nielsen and Smedsgaard used electrospray (ESI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry after LC separation to compile a database of 474 fungal metabolites . Still, the number of LC\u2013MS or LC\u2013MS/MS methods for the simultaneous determination of more than one family of mycotoxins is very limited. Rundberget and Wilkins developed and validated such a method for the determination of Penicillium mycotoxins in food and feed . Driffield et al. published an ESI-MS/MS method, capable to determine NIV, DON, ZON, ochratoxin A and aflatoxin B1 in pig livers. Just recently, Feldmann et al. put forward another ESI\u2013MS/MS method for the detection of NIV, DON, T-2, DAS, trichothecin and trichothecolon in apple products. Berger et al. introduced an LC-ion trap method for the quantitative determination and structure elucidation of nine type A- and B-trichothecenes.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a fast, accurate and reliable LC\u2014triple quadrupole mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of the Fusarium mycotoxins NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in maize. During method development, two different commercially available clean-up columns, MycoSep\u00ae #226 and #227 from Romer Labs\u00ae, were tested for their suitability to be combined with LC\u2013MS/MS. Method performance characteristics, such as recoveries, linearities over the working ranges, limits of detection, limits of quantification, trueness and precision have been evaluated and are presented.\nThe mycotoxins NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON as well as the internal standard zearalanone (ZAN) were purchased from biopure Referenzsubstanzen GmbH (Tulln, Austria) as liquid calibrants in acetonitrile and stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. Before use, the solutions were brought to room temperature. Ammonium acetate (MS grade), ammonium formiate (MS grade), acetic acid (p.a.) and formic acid (p.a.) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol and acetonitrile were LC grade and obtained from J.T. Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands). Water for LC mobile phase was purified successively by reverse osmosis and a Milli-Q plus system from Millipore (Molsheim, France). MycoSep\u00ae #226 and #227 clean-up columns were provided by Romer Labs\u00ae Diagnostic GmbH (Herzogenburg, Austria). A NM20ZA nitrogen generator from Peak Scientific Instruments (Inchinnan, Scotland) was used for the gas supply of the mass spectrometer. BCR 378 and BCR 717 are certified reference materials and were purchased from IRMM (Geel, Belgium).\nLC\u2013MS/MS analysis was performed on a QTrap-LC\u2013MS/MS system from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with either an APCI or an ESI interface and a 1100 Series LC system from Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany). The mass spectrometer was used exclusively in the triple quadrupole mode.\nChromatographic separation was achieved on an Aquasil\u00ae RP-18 column (3 \u03bcm, 100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) from Thermo Electron (Woburn, MA, USA), equipped with a C-18 guard column, at 25 \u00b0C using gradient elution. Mobile phase A consisted of methanol/water, 20/80 (v/v), containing 5 mM ammonium acetate, while mobile phase B consisted of methanol/water, 90/10 (v/v), also containing 5 mM ammonium acetate. Elution with mobile phase A was maintained for 0.5 min, afterwards a linear gradient was applied, reaching 100% mobile phase B after 4.5 min (holding time: 2.5 min), and than switched back (7.1 min) to mobile phase A (holding time: 2.9 min), which was maintained till the end of the run at 10.0 min. In order to prevent highly polar matrix compounds from entering the MS ion source, a switching valve was used to discard the LC eluent, before transferring it into the MS interface 2 min after LC injection. The flow rate was set to 1.0 ml/min, while the injection volume was 25 \u03bcl.\nThe APCI interface was used in both negative and positive ion modes at 450 \u00b0C with the following settings: curtain gas (CUR) 35 psi (241 kPa of max. 99.5% nitrogen), nebulizer gas (GS1) 60 psi (414 kPa of zero grade air), auxiliary gas (GS2) 15 psi (103 kPa of zero grade air), corona discharge needle current (NC), \u22122 or +2 \u03bcA, respectively, collision-activated dissociation gas (CAD) 6 (arbitrary units, corresponding to the pressure of collision gas (nitrogen) in Q2), MRM dwell time 25 ms, pause between mass ranges 5 ms, settling time (polarity switch only) 700 ms. The ESI interface was solely used for optimization of the MS/MS parameters\u2014experimental settings were as follows: temperature 400 \u00b0C, CUR 20 psi (138 kPa), GS1 30 psi (207 kPa), GS2 75 psi (517 kPa), ionization voltage \u22124200 or +5000 V, respectively, CAD 6.\nFor spiking experiments, a mixed stock solution, containing NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in acetonitrile, was added to blank maize. The spiked samples were left overnight, to allow solvent evaporation prior to the extraction. Five replicates of eight levels of 0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/kg were prepared.\nGround maize samples (10.00 \u00b1 0.01 g) were spiked with 5 \u03bcg ZAN (50 \u03bcl of a 100.0 \u03bcg/ml solution in acetonitrile). After solvent evaporation the samples were extracted for 90 min at 180 rpm on an automatic shaker (GFL, Burgwedel, Germany) with 40.0 ml acetonitrile/water (84/16, v/v). The extracts were filtered (S&S folded filters, 59512, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and 8.0 ml thereof were transferred into sample tubes. Afterwards the MycoSep\u00ae #226 (or #227) columns were pushed into the tubes. Four milliliter of the purified extracts were withdrawn using a 1 ml pipette, transferred into 4 ml glass vials and evaporated to dryness at 50 \u00b0C under a constant stream of nitrogen. The residues were then dissolved in 1.0 ml of the starting gradient LC mobile phase A (methanol/water, 20/80 (v/v), containing 5 mM ammonium acetate) by vortexing vigorously for 1 min. Before LC analysis, the solutions were pressed through 0.22 \u03bcm membrane filters (Millex-GV, Millipore, Molsheim, France).\nMixed standard solutions of 0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/l were prepared. Therefore, 0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500 or 1000 \u03bcl of a mixed stock solution containing 1000 \u03bcg/l of each NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in acetonitrile were mixed with 50 \u03bcl of ZAN solution (10.0 \u03bcg/ml in acetonitrile). The liquid was evaporated to dryness at 50 \u00b0C under a constant stream of nitrogen. Residues were then dissolved in 1.0 ml methanol/water, 20/80 (v/v), containing 5 mM ammonium acetate, by vortexing vigorously for 1 min.\nCalibration curves for each analyte were constructed by plotting the analyte concentration versus the signal intensity (area) of the analyte using the Analyst\u00ae software Version 1.4 . For ZON, the analyte concentration divided by the concentration of the internal standard was plotted versus the area of the analyte divided by the area of the internal standard. Recoveries and R.S.D. were calculated from linear regression curves using Validata, a Microsoft Excel macro by Wegscheider et al. . Briefly, the MS signal intensities obtained from spiking experiments were used for the calculation of analyte concentrations. These concentrations were plotted against the actual spiking levels and recoveries were taken from the slopes of the regression lines. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were calculated, based on signal to noise ratios (S/N) of 3/1 and 10/1, respectively, using the Analyst\u00ae software from Applied Biosystems .\nMethod development started with full scan experiments (Q1 scan mode, scan range 250\u2013550 amu, scan time 0.25 s) of 5 \u03bcg/ml solutions of the intended mycotoxins in both positive and negative modes using flow injections. 10 \u03bcl of the mycotoxin standards in acetonitrile were injected into a stream 0.5 ml/min of either acetonitrile/water, 50/50 (v/v) or methanol/water, 50/50 (v/v) and analyzed using the ESI interface or the APCI interface. No analytical column was used with the flow injections, while standard settings were used for the interfaces. The use of methanol instead of acetonitrile in the solvent mixtures resulted in higher intensities for all analytes, but especially for the type B-trichothecenes. This is in agreement with other LC\u2013MS methods . While the type B-trichothecenes and ZON showed higher signal intensities in the negative ionization mode, type A-trichothecenes were more easily transferred to positive ions. With the exception of ZON, which was almost exclusively ionized to [ZON \u2212 H]\u2212 ions in the negative ionization modes with both interfaces, adduct formation was detected. Depending on the structure of the trichothecene [M \u2212 H]\u2212, [M + HCOO]\u2212 and [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions in negative and [M + H]+, [M + NH4]+, [M + Na]+ as well as [M + K]+ ions in positive ionization mode are formed. The multitude of trichothecene adduct ions did not decrease using the APCI interface.\nWe continued to verify different settings, as we repeated the above experiments with new solvent mixtures, consisting of methanol/water, containing either 5 mM ammonium formiate or 5 mM ammonium acetate. The ratio of methanol in the eluent was estimated according to the retention of the target analyte on an Aquasil\u00ae C-18 RP column. Again, flow injections were used for APCI and ESI, but this time an eluent split of 1:50 before the ESI interface was applied to reduce the flow into the MS ion source. Using buffers, the adduct ion formation could be shifted towards [M + NH4]+ ions in positive mode for the type A-trichothecenes and to either [M + HCOO]\u2212 or [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions in negative mode for the type B-trichothecenes depending on the buffer added to the solvent. As a result of these experiments ammonium acetate was used as buffer for all further experiments. Since the use of the buffer lead to the formation of single trichothecene-adduct ion species, the intensities of these ions were much higher compared to experiments without buffers. Using ammonium acetate, the peak areas of both [M + NH4]+ ions for type A-trichothecenes in the positive ionization mode and [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions for type B-trichothecenes in the negative ionization mode roughly equaled the sum of the different analyte adduct ions when using no buffer at all.\nFor ZON signal intensities of the quasi molecular ions and the analyte adduct ions were in the same range for both interfaces, but the APCI interface performed slightly better for type A-trichothecenes (particularly for HT-2) and significantly better for type B-trichothecenes with our settings (Fig. 2 ). The latter is in contrary to the results of Lagana et al. , who opted for the ESI interface in their LC\u2013MS/MS method for type B-trichothecenes and to Feldmann et al. in their multitoxin method. Like Berger et al. in their ion-trap method and Razzazi-Fazeli et al. in their LC\u2013MS methods we decided to use the APCI interface for our method.\nChromatographic separation on an Thermo Electron Aquasil\u00ae RP-18 column using a methanol/water gradient containing 5 mM ammonium acetate revealed that all five type B-trichothecenes are eluting before the three type A-trichothecenes, which are eluting before zearalenone. This way, it was possible to switch ionization polarities from negative for the type B-trichothecenes to positive for the type A-trichothecenes and back to negative for ZON in the same LC run, resulting in maximum intensities. The use of a 100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm column, combined with the ability of the APCI interface to handle large solvent flows, resulted in an analysis time of only 10 min for the nine mycotoxins. This is quicker than any of the LC\u2013MS methods mentioned above, which have LC run times ranging from 12 to 30 min.\nThe ESI interface was used in conjunction with a syringe pump (direct infusion of 5 \u03bcg/ml solutions of the individual mycotoxins into the LC eluent, using a T-piece) for optimization of the MS/MS parameters. The quantitative optimization tool of the instrument software was used for this purpose. Resulting MRM transitions, declustering potentials (DP) and collision energies (CE) are summarized in Table 1 . For the type B-trichothecenes the highest abundances after fragmentation of the [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions was monitored with either [CH3COO]\u2212 (m/z = 59) or [M \u2212 H]\u2212 ions, showing the tendency of the adduct ions to preferentially form acetate in the collision cell. Since structural information for the secure identification of analytes is lost when non-analyte-specific fragments, such as acetate, are used for detection, fragments of the parent toxins have been monitored as qualifiers in addition to the acetate ions to confirm the identities of the toxins and to monitor the ratios of acetate to \u201cqualifier\u201d. Although these qualifiers showed higher detection limits, they were additionally used in quantification to confirm constant ion abundance ratios and therefore the presence of the respective analytes.\nDue to the fast LC gradient, 3ADON and 15ADON could not be separated chromatographically. While we obtained a single LC peak for the sum of both 3- and 15-ADON (ADONs), different fragmentation behavior also allows the separate determination and quantification of 3ADON, albeit at a lower sensitivity. In the case of 3ADON, [M \u2212 H-30]\u2212 ions with m/z 307 are formed in the collision cell of the mass spectrometer by cleavage of the C-15 group. As an acetate group is present in the case of 15ADON, this cleavage of [CH2O] could not be seen there. The specific transition for 3ADON was first considered by Berger et al. , proven by the authors and confirmed by Razzazi-Fazeli et al. .\nWith the exception of NIV, the recoveries for the MycoSep\u00ae #227 column, were excellent (82\u201398%) for both type A- and B-trichothecenes in our LC\u2013MS/MS method (Table 2 ). ZON, however, is retarded almost completely on these columns, making the MycoSep\u00ae #227 columns unsuitable for this mycotoxin. Nonetheless, these columns can be used effectively for clean-up in the determination of trichothecenes.\nThe MycoSep\u00ae #226 columns allow compounds to pass through over a wider range of polarities. Therefore, more analytes\u2014including ZON\u2014but also more matrix compounds could be found. Recoveries with this column ranged from about 73% (T-2) to about 89% (FUS-X) for all trichothecenes but for NIV, and therefore it can be regarded as acceptable for the method described (Table 2). About 50% recovery was found for NIV, which is in accordance to the manufacturer's specifications. In case of ZON, however, just 30% recovery could be obtained, although about 100% recovery were specified. We suspected that a strong matrix effect, resulting in ion suppression, could be the cause for that. Therefore, we tested the suitability of ZAN as internal standard compound by adding it to the extracts immediately after sample clean-up. ZAN, a compound closely related to ZON is possessing a single bond between C-11 and C-12 instead of a double bond. ZAN is partly co-eluting with ZON under our LC conditions. Using ZAN as internal standard, the recovery for ZON was 99%, so ZAN emended well for matrix effects. Further experiments revealed that both ZON and ZAN are behaving identically with regard to the MycoSep\u00ae #226 clean-up, so we opted to apply ZAN before clean-up. Furthermore, it is recommended to wash the LC column with solvent B after every four to five injections for 10 min, in order to wash out non-polar components, when clean-up with the #226 column is performed.\nCalibration curves for all analytes are linear over the working range of 30\u20131000 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. Thirty to one thousand \u03bcg/kg for NIV and 3ADON, according to the Validata software program . Squared correlation coefficients (R 2) were in the range of 0.994\u20130.999 for the eight point calibration curves, depending on the mycotoxin. Limits of detection ranged from 0.3 \u03bcg/kg for T-2 to 3.8 \u03bcg/kg for 3ADON using #226 clean-up. Analysis of the type B-trichothecenes, using the unusual [M + CH3COO]\u2212 to [CH3COO]\u2212 MRM transitions worked well. No matrix influences, differences in linearity or changes in signal intensity ratios could be detected in comparison to the \u201cqualifiers\u201d. Limits of detection (S/N = 3/1) and quantification (S/N = 10/1) were, however, about four to five times lower than for the qualifying transitions. Figs. 3 and 4 show total (TIC) and extracted (XIC) ion chromatograms of maize which was spiked with 100 \u03bcg/kg per mycotoxin, while Table 3 comprises limits of detection, limits of quantification and linear working ranges for the method.\nCertified reference materials (CRM) for both DON (CRM 378) and ZON (CRM 717) were available from the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) of the European Commission. In order to confirm the applicability to real world samples and the accuracy of our method, we analyzed these CRMs and compared our results to the certified values. The value for DON was corrected for its recovery, while this was not necessary for ZON, as a suitable internal standard was found for this mycotoxin. Results matched nicely, as we found 447 \u00b1 32 \u03bcg DON/kg compared to the certified value of 430 \u00b1 40 \u03bcg DON/kg and 78.4 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcg ZON/kg compared to the certified value of 83.0 \u00b1 9.0 \u03bcg ZON/kg. Evaluation of the results according to ISO guide 33 showed no significant bias for both mycotoxins.\nAlthough a variety of different LC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS/MS methods exists for the determination of trichothecenes and for zearalenone, this paper describes the first method for the simultaneous determination of all the major A- and B-trichothecenes and ZON in a single run. Moreover, the use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer yields better detection limits than single quadrupole instruments. This is caused by improved signal to noise ratios due to the additional selectivity of the second MS step. LODs gained with ion-traps were comparably low for the determination of trichothecenes and zearalenone. The drawback of 3-dimensional ion-trap instruments for the quantification of trace contaminants, such as mycotoxins, has been described in literature and comprise poor calibration linearity and lower measurement repeatability, compared to triple quadrupole instruments. For DON, T-2 and ZON, which are the most frequently monitored compounds of the mycotoxins investigated in this study, selected characteristics of different LC/MS methods have been illustrated in Table 4 .\nWe developed a rapid quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of the major Fusarium mycotoxins NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in maize using LC-APCI-MS/MS detection. Simple clean-up using MycoSep\u00ae columns combined with fast LC separation greatly reduce the analysis time and make this method suitable for routine analysis. The use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer allows the unambiguous identification of these nine mycotoxins and their concurrent quantification in the low \u03bcg/kg-range. The increased analytical throughput and the simultaneous determination of different groups of mycotoxins hold great promises for this and other LC\u2013MS/MS analyses in the near future. Nonetheless, suitable internal standards for the quantification of trichothecenes by LC\u2013MS methods would be highly desirable, as the accuracy of such methods would be even better.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "All mycotoxins are low-molecular weight substances produced as secondary metabolites by various molds . By definition, mycotoxins are poisonous to vertebrates in low concentrations. Numerous Fusarium species, such as Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium poae, Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium verticillioides belong to the most prevalent molds in temperate climatic regions . Fusarium species can occur on a broad range of hosts, including barley, maize, millet, oat, rice, rye and wheat . Trichothecenes and zearalenone are major Fusarium mycotoxins . The trichothecenes are polycyclic sesquiterpenoids, possessing a C-9,10 double bond, a C-12,13-epoxide ring, and various hydroxyl and acetoxy groups. According to their characteristic functional groups, trichothecenes can be grouped into four types (A\u2013D). Type-A trichothecenes have an oxygen function at C-8, which is different from a keto-group. Members of this group include the highly toxic HT-2 toxin (HT-2), T-2 toxin (T-2) and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS). The type-B trichothecenes, such as nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), fusarenon X (FUS-X), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalneol (3ADON) and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15ADON), possess a C-8 keto-group. Type C trichothecenes are characterized by a second epoxide-group, while type D trichothecenes are macrocyclic compounds. Chemical structures of the Fusarium mycotoxins investigated in the present paper are shown in Fig. 1 . Acute and chronic ingestion by humans and animals can elicit a variety of toxic effects, including fever, diarrhea, vomiting, necrosis, hemorrhage and depletion of bone marrow . Maximum tolerated levels for DON, the most commonly detected type-B trichothecene, in food commodities are usually in the range from 500 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg .\nAnalytical methods for the determination of trichothecenes have been reviewed . For the determination of type A-trichothecenes analytical methods using GC with electron capture detection (ECD), GC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS for the chromatographic separation and detection are described. The most common methods for the determination of type B-trichothecenes include GC\u2013ECD, GC\u2013MS, LC\u2013UV, LC with either pre or post column derivatisation and fluorescence detection (FLD), LC\u2013MS and recently also LC\u2013MS/MS . There are also methods capable of determining both type A- and B-trichothecenes simultaneously, using GC\u2013ECD, GC\u2013MS, LC\u2013MS or LC\u2013MS/MS . Clean-up of sample extracts for the determination of trichothecenes in cereals is frequently done by MycoSep\u00ae #227 columns, which have also been successfully applied in several LC\u2013MS methods .\nZearalenone, 6-(10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl)-\u03b2-resorcyclic acid \u03bc-lactone, is a Fusarium metabolite with potent estrogenic activity . Maximum tolerated or guideline levels for ZON in food are ranging from 30 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg . Analytical methods for the determination of ZON have also been reviewed . TLC and GC methods are available, but ZON is usually determined either by LC\u2013FLD, by LC\u2013MS or by LC\u2013MS/MS . MycoSep\u00ae #226 columns were used for LC\u2013MS analysis of ZON in a method by Rosenberg et al. .\nThe development of multimycotoxin methods, allowing to detect and determine several groups of co-occurring mycotoxins with single chromatographic runs, is highly desirable. Frisvad and Thrane did pioneer work in this field as early as 1987 using LC\u2013UV . The complex composition of food and feed matrices as well as the wide range of physical and chemical properties of mycotoxins require selective and sensitive detection techniques, such as mass spectrometry, especially for multitoxin methods. In the field of Fusarium mycotoxins there are some GC\u2013MS methods for the simultaneous determination of trichothecenes and ZON . However, the need to derivatise the samples prior to GC analysis and the huge technical improvements in the field of LC\u2013MS have increased the number of methods using LC\u2013MS. Nielsen and Smedsgaard used electrospray (ESI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry after LC separation to compile a database of 474 fungal metabolites . Still, the number of LC\u2013MS or LC\u2013MS/MS methods for the simultaneous determination of more than one family of mycotoxins is very limited. Rundberget and Wilkins developed and validated such a method for the determination of Penicillium mycotoxins in food and feed . Driffield et al. published an ESI-MS/MS method, capable to determine NIV, DON, ZON, ochratoxin A and aflatoxin B1 in pig livers. Just recently, Feldmann et al. put forward another ESI\u2013MS/MS method for the detection of NIV, DON, T-2, DAS, trichothecin and trichothecolon in apple products. Berger et al. introduced an LC-ion trap method for the quantitative determination and structure elucidation of nine type A- and B-trichothecenes.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a fast, accurate and reliable LC\u2014triple quadrupole mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of the Fusarium mycotoxins NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in maize. During method development, two different commercially available clean-up columns, MycoSep\u00ae #226 and #227 from Romer Labs\u00ae, were tested for their suitability to be combined with LC\u2013MS/MS. Method performance characteristics, such as recoveries, linearities over the working ranges, limits of detection, limits of quantification, trueness and precision have been evaluated and are presented.\nThe mycotoxins NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON as well as the internal standard zearalanone (ZAN) were purchased from biopure Referenzsubstanzen GmbH (Tulln, Austria) as liquid calibrants in acetonitrile and stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. Before use, the solutions were brought to room temperature. Ammonium acetate (MS grade), ammonium formiate (MS grade), acetic acid (p.a.) and formic acid (p.a.) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol and acetonitrile were LC grade and obtained from J.T. Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands). Water for LC mobile phase was purified successively by reverse osmosis and a Milli-Q plus system from Millipore (Molsheim, France). MycoSep\u00ae #226 and #227 clean-up columns were provided by Romer Labs\u00ae Diagnostic GmbH (Herzogenburg, Austria). A NM20ZA nitrogen generator from Peak Scientific Instruments (Inchinnan, Scotland) was used for the gas supply of the mass spectrometer. BCR 378 and BCR 717 are certified reference materials and were purchased from IRMM (Geel, Belgium).\nLC\u2013MS/MS analysis was performed on a QTrap-LC\u2013MS/MS system from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with either an APCI or an ESI interface and a 1100 Series LC system from Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany). The mass spectrometer was used exclusively in the triple quadrupole mode.\nChromatographic separation was achieved on an Aquasil\u00ae RP-18 column (3 \u03bcm, 100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) from Thermo Electron (Woburn, MA, USA), equipped with a C-18 guard column, at 25 \u00b0C using gradient elution. Mobile phase A consisted of methanol/water, 20/80 (v/v), containing 5 mM ammonium acetate, while mobile phase B consisted of methanol/water, 90/10 (v/v), also containing 5 mM ammonium acetate. Elution with mobile phase A was maintained for 0.5 min, afterwards a linear gradient was applied, reaching 100% mobile phase B after 4.5 min (holding time: 2.5 min), and than switched back (7.1 min) to mobile phase A (holding time: 2.9 min), which was maintained till the end of the run at 10.0 min. In order to prevent highly polar matrix compounds from entering the MS ion source, a switching valve was used to discard the LC eluent, before transferring it into the MS interface 2 min after LC injection. The flow rate was set to 1.0 ml/min, while the injection volume was 25 \u03bcl.\nThe APCI interface was used in both negative and positive ion modes at 450 \u00b0C with the following settings: curtain gas (CUR) 35 psi (241 kPa of max. 99.5% nitrogen), nebulizer gas (GS1) 60 psi (414 kPa of zero grade air), auxiliary gas (GS2) 15 psi (103 kPa of zero grade air), corona discharge needle current (NC), \u22122 or +2 \u03bcA, respectively, collision-activated dissociation gas (CAD) 6 (arbitrary units, corresponding to the pressure of collision gas (nitrogen) in Q2), MRM dwell time 25 ms, pause between mass ranges 5 ms, settling time (polarity switch only) 700 ms. The ESI interface was solely used for optimization of the MS/MS parameters\u2014experimental settings were as follows: temperature 400 \u00b0C, CUR 20 psi (138 kPa), GS1 30 psi (207 kPa), GS2 75 psi (517 kPa), ionization voltage \u22124200 or +5000 V, respectively, CAD 6.\nFor spiking experiments, a mixed stock solution, containing NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in acetonitrile, was added to blank maize. The spiked samples were left overnight, to allow solvent evaporation prior to the extraction. Five replicates of eight levels of 0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/kg were prepared.\nGround maize samples (10.00 \u00b1 0.01 g) were spiked with 5 \u03bcg ZAN (50 \u03bcl of a 100.0 \u03bcg/ml solution in acetonitrile). After solvent evaporation the samples were extracted for 90 min at 180 rpm on an automatic shaker (GFL, Burgwedel, Germany) with 40.0 ml acetonitrile/water (84/16, v/v). The extracts were filtered (S&S folded filters, 59512, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and 8.0 ml thereof were transferred into sample tubes. Afterwards the MycoSep\u00ae #226 (or #227) columns were pushed into the tubes. Four milliliter of the purified extracts were withdrawn using a 1 ml pipette, transferred into 4 ml glass vials and evaporated to dryness at 50 \u00b0C under a constant stream of nitrogen. The residues were then dissolved in 1.0 ml of the starting gradient LC mobile phase A (methanol/water, 20/80 (v/v), containing 5 mM ammonium acetate) by vortexing vigorously for 1 min. Before LC analysis, the solutions were pressed through 0.22 \u03bcm membrane filters (Millex-GV, Millipore, Molsheim, France).\nMixed standard solutions of 0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/l were prepared. Therefore, 0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500 or 1000 \u03bcl of a mixed stock solution containing 1000 \u03bcg/l of each NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in acetonitrile were mixed with 50 \u03bcl of ZAN solution (10.0 \u03bcg/ml in acetonitrile). The liquid was evaporated to dryness at 50 \u00b0C under a constant stream of nitrogen. Residues were then dissolved in 1.0 ml methanol/water, 20/80 (v/v), containing 5 mM ammonium acetate, by vortexing vigorously for 1 min.\nCalibration curves for each analyte were constructed by plotting the analyte concentration versus the signal intensity (area) of the analyte using the Analyst\u00ae software Version 1.4 . For ZON, the analyte concentration divided by the concentration of the internal standard was plotted versus the area of the analyte divided by the area of the internal standard. Recoveries and R.S.D. were calculated from linear regression curves using Validata, a Microsoft Excel macro by Wegscheider et al. . Briefly, the MS signal intensities obtained from spiking experiments were used for the calculation of analyte concentrations. These concentrations were plotted against the actual spiking levels and recoveries were taken from the slopes of the regression lines. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were calculated, based on signal to noise ratios (S/N) of 3/1 and 10/1, respectively, using the Analyst\u00ae software from Applied Biosystems .\nMethod development started with full scan experiments (Q1 scan mode, scan range 250\u2013550 amu, scan time 0.25 s) of 5 \u03bcg/ml solutions of the intended mycotoxins in both positive and negative modes using flow injections. 10 \u03bcl of the mycotoxin standards in acetonitrile were injected into a stream 0.5 ml/min of either acetonitrile/water, 50/50 (v/v) or methanol/water, 50/50 (v/v) and analyzed using the ESI interface or the APCI interface. No analytical column was used with the flow injections, while standard settings were used for the interfaces. The use of methanol instead of acetonitrile in the solvent mixtures resulted in higher intensities for all analytes, but especially for the type B-trichothecenes. This is in agreement with other LC\u2013MS methods . While the type B-trichothecenes and ZON showed higher signal intensities in the negative ionization mode, type A-trichothecenes were more easily transferred to positive ions. With the exception of ZON, which was almost exclusively ionized to [ZON \u2212 H]\u2212 ions in the negative ionization modes with both interfaces, adduct formation was detected. Depending on the structure of the trichothecene [M \u2212 H]\u2212, [M + HCOO]\u2212 and [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions in negative and [M + H]+, [M + NH4]+, [M + Na]+ as well as [M + K]+ ions in positive ionization mode are formed. The multitude of trichothecene adduct ions did not decrease using the APCI interface.\nWe continued to verify different settings, as we repeated the above experiments with new solvent mixtures, consisting of methanol/water, containing either 5 mM ammonium formiate or 5 mM ammonium acetate. The ratio of methanol in the eluent was estimated according to the retention of the target analyte on an Aquasil\u00ae C-18 RP column. Again, flow injections were used for APCI and ESI, but this time an eluent split of 1:50 before the ESI interface was applied to reduce the flow into the MS ion source. Using buffers, the adduct ion formation could be shifted towards [M + NH4]+ ions in positive mode for the type A-trichothecenes and to either [M + HCOO]\u2212 or [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions in negative mode for the type B-trichothecenes depending on the buffer added to the solvent. As a result of these experiments ammonium acetate was used as buffer for all further experiments. Since the use of the buffer lead to the formation of single trichothecene-adduct ion species, the intensities of these ions were much higher compared to experiments without buffers. Using ammonium acetate, the peak areas of both [M + NH4]+ ions for type A-trichothecenes in the positive ionization mode and [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions for type B-trichothecenes in the negative ionization mode roughly equaled the sum of the different analyte adduct ions when using no buffer at all.\nFor ZON signal intensities of the quasi molecular ions and the analyte adduct ions were in the same range for both interfaces, but the APCI interface performed slightly better for type A-trichothecenes (particularly for HT-2) and significantly better for type B-trichothecenes with our settings (Fig. 2 ). The latter is in contrary to the results of Lagana et al. , who opted for the ESI interface in their LC\u2013MS/MS method for type B-trichothecenes and to Feldmann et al. in their multitoxin method. Like Berger et al. in their ion-trap method and Razzazi-Fazeli et al. in their LC\u2013MS methods we decided to use the APCI interface for our method.\nChromatographic separation on an Thermo Electron Aquasil\u00ae RP-18 column using a methanol/water gradient containing 5 mM ammonium acetate revealed that all five type B-trichothecenes are eluting before the three type A-trichothecenes, which are eluting before zearalenone. This way, it was possible to switch ionization polarities from negative for the type B-trichothecenes to positive for the type A-trichothecenes and back to negative for ZON in the same LC run, resulting in maximum intensities. The use of a 100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm column, combined with the ability of the APCI interface to handle large solvent flows, resulted in an analysis time of only 10 min for the nine mycotoxins. This is quicker than any of the LC\u2013MS methods mentioned above, which have LC run times ranging from 12 to 30 min.\nThe ESI interface was used in conjunction with a syringe pump (direct infusion of 5 \u03bcg/ml solutions of the individual mycotoxins into the LC eluent, using a T-piece) for optimization of the MS/MS parameters. The quantitative optimization tool of the instrument software was used for this purpose. Resulting MRM transitions, declustering potentials (DP) and collision energies (CE) are summarized in Table 1 . For the type B-trichothecenes the highest abundances after fragmentation of the [M + CH3COO]\u2212 ions was monitored with either [CH3COO]\u2212 (m/z = 59) or [M \u2212 H]\u2212 ions, showing the tendency of the adduct ions to preferentially form acetate in the collision cell. Since structural information for the secure identification of analytes is lost when non-analyte-specific fragments, such as acetate, are used for detection, fragments of the parent toxins have been monitored as qualifiers in addition to the acetate ions to confirm the identities of the toxins and to monitor the ratios of acetate to \u201cqualifier\u201d. Although these qualifiers showed higher detection limits, they were additionally used in quantification to confirm constant ion abundance ratios and therefore the presence of the respective analytes.\nDue to the fast LC gradient, 3ADON and 15ADON could not be separated chromatographically. While we obtained a single LC peak for the sum of both 3- and 15-ADON (ADONs), different fragmentation behavior also allows the separate determination and quantification of 3ADON, albeit at a lower sensitivity. In the case of 3ADON, [M \u2212 H-30]\u2212 ions with m/z 307 are formed in the collision cell of the mass spectrometer by cleavage of the C-15 group. As an acetate group is present in the case of 15ADON, this cleavage of [CH2O] could not be seen there. The specific transition for 3ADON was first considered by Berger et al. , proven by the authors and confirmed by Razzazi-Fazeli et al. .\nWith the exception of NIV, the recoveries for the MycoSep\u00ae #227 column, were excellent (82\u201398%) for both type A- and B-trichothecenes in our LC\u2013MS/MS method (Table 2 ). ZON, however, is retarded almost completely on these columns, making the MycoSep\u00ae #227 columns unsuitable for this mycotoxin. Nonetheless, these columns can be used effectively for clean-up in the determination of trichothecenes.\nThe MycoSep\u00ae #226 columns allow compounds to pass through over a wider range of polarities. Therefore, more analytes\u2014including ZON\u2014but also more matrix compounds could be found. Recoveries with this column ranged from about 73% (T-2) to about 89% (FUS-X) for all trichothecenes but for NIV, and therefore it can be regarded as acceptable for the method described (Table 2). About 50% recovery was found for NIV, which is in accordance to the manufacturer's specifications. In case of ZON, however, just 30% recovery could be obtained, although about 100% recovery were specified. We suspected that a strong matrix effect, resulting in ion suppression, could be the cause for that. Therefore, we tested the suitability of ZAN as internal standard compound by adding it to the extracts immediately after sample clean-up. ZAN, a compound closely related to ZON is possessing a single bond between C-11 and C-12 instead of a double bond. ZAN is partly co-eluting with ZON under our LC conditions. Using ZAN as internal standard, the recovery for ZON was 99%, so ZAN emended well for matrix effects. Further experiments revealed that both ZON and ZAN are behaving identically with regard to the MycoSep\u00ae #226 clean-up, so we opted to apply ZAN before clean-up. Furthermore, it is recommended to wash the LC column with solvent B after every four to five injections for 10 min, in order to wash out non-polar components, when clean-up with the #226 column is performed.\nCalibration curves for all analytes are linear over the working range of 30\u20131000 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. Thirty to one thousand \u03bcg/kg for NIV and 3ADON, according to the Validata software program . Squared correlation coefficients (R 2) were in the range of 0.994\u20130.999 for the eight point calibration curves, depending on the mycotoxin. Limits of detection ranged from 0.3 \u03bcg/kg for T-2 to 3.8 \u03bcg/kg for 3ADON using #226 clean-up. Analysis of the type B-trichothecenes, using the unusual [M + CH3COO]\u2212 to [CH3COO]\u2212 MRM transitions worked well. No matrix influences, differences in linearity or changes in signal intensity ratios could be detected in comparison to the \u201cqualifiers\u201d. Limits of detection (S/N = 3/1) and quantification (S/N = 10/1) were, however, about four to five times lower than for the qualifying transitions. Figs. 3 and 4 show total (TIC) and extracted (XIC) ion chromatograms of maize which was spiked with 100 \u03bcg/kg per mycotoxin, while Table 3 comprises limits of detection, limits of quantification and linear working ranges for the method.\nCertified reference materials (CRM) for both DON (CRM 378) and ZON (CRM 717) were available from the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) of the European Commission. In order to confirm the applicability to real world samples and the accuracy of our method, we analyzed these CRMs and compared our results to the certified values. The value for DON was corrected for its recovery, while this was not necessary for ZON, as a suitable internal standard was found for this mycotoxin. Results matched nicely, as we found 447 \u00b1 32 \u03bcg DON/kg compared to the certified value of 430 \u00b1 40 \u03bcg DON/kg and 78.4 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcg ZON/kg compared to the certified value of 83.0 \u00b1 9.0 \u03bcg ZON/kg. Evaluation of the results according to ISO guide 33 showed no significant bias for both mycotoxins.\nAlthough a variety of different LC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS/MS methods exists for the determination of trichothecenes and for zearalenone, this paper describes the first method for the simultaneous determination of all the major A- and B-trichothecenes and ZON in a single run. Moreover, the use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer yields better detection limits than single quadrupole instruments. This is caused by improved signal to noise ratios due to the additional selectivity of the second MS step. LODs gained with ion-traps were comparably low for the determination of trichothecenes and zearalenone. The drawback of 3-dimensional ion-trap instruments for the quantification of trace contaminants, such as mycotoxins, has been described in literature and comprise poor calibration linearity and lower measurement repeatability, compared to triple quadrupole instruments. For DON, T-2 and ZON, which are the most frequently monitored compounds of the mycotoxins investigated in this study, selected characteristics of different LC/MS methods have been illustrated in Table 4 .\nWe developed a rapid quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of the major Fusarium mycotoxins NIV, DON, FUS-X, 3ADON, 15ADON, DAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZON in maize using LC-APCI-MS/MS detection. Simple clean-up using MycoSep\u00ae columns combined with fast LC separation greatly reduce the analysis time and make this method suitable for routine analysis. The use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer allows the unambiguous identification of these nine mycotoxins and their concurrent quantification in the low \u03bcg/kg-range. The increased analytical throughput and the simultaneous determination of different groups of mycotoxins hold great promises for this and other LC\u2013MS/MS analyses in the near future. Nonetheless, suitable internal standards for the quantification of trichothecenes by LC\u2013MS methods would be highly desirable, as the accuracy of such methods would be even better."

Since the binding selectivity of the lipophilic ionophore dictates, for the most part, the ion-exchange selectivity of the membrane, large cation and anion selectivity variations can be achieved by suitable choice of the ionophore. In fact, ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for as many as 60 analytes have been described thus far . A large number of novel and analytically useful ionophores have been discovered only in the past few years, indicating that this field is steadily moving forward . These ionophores are now also used to fabricate optical and voltammetric/amperometric sensors based on analogous membrane materials.\nThe response mechanism of classical polymeric membrane based ion-selective electrodes is now well understood, and appropriate simplifications of the theory have allowed more scientists to corroborate their experimental findings theoretically. It is now well established that ISEs exhibit Nernstian responses only if the membrane composition remains approximately invariant to sample concentration changes. In addition, it is normally assumed that the aqueous phase boundary contacting the ISE membrane has a composition identical to the sample bulk. Under these circumstances, ISEs behave ideally and respond to ion activities according to the Nernst equation . In recent years, however, a number of interesting cases have been observed and exploited analytically that employ systems that function quite differently. With such nonclassical approaches, detection limits can be lowered, electrode sensitivities may be increased, new classes of analytes become measurable and ISEs can be made responsive to ion concentrations rather than activities. This review summarizes these latest developments and should provide motivation for further advances in these areas.\nThe theory of polymeric membrane ion-selective electrodes under zero-current conditions is traditionally subdivided into two phase boundary potentials and a membrane internal diffusion potential. The latter contribution has been shown to be small in most cases , so that the membrane potential E I is primarily a function of the interfacial potential at the sample\u2013membrane phase boundary: EI=E0+RTzIFlnkIaIz+[Iz+] where a I and [Iz I+] are the sample activity and membrane concentration of Iz I+ at that phase boundary, k I incorporates the free energy of transfer of the ion from the aqueous to the organic phase, and all other constant potential contributions are included in E 0 (including the internal phase boundary potential at the inner side of the membrane). The terms R, T, and F have their usual meanings. Ion-selective membranes are hydrophobic and have ion-exchange properties due to an added ion-exchanger sites, the ion-exchange properties of the ionophore itself, or ionic impurities of the membrane material. In such situations, the concentration of extractable sample ions is typically dictated by the concentration of the ion-exchanger in the membrane. If no interferences from other sample ions are observed, therefore, the membrane concentration of Iz I+ is approximately sample independent and Eq. (1) reduces to the Nernst equation EI=EI0+RTzIFlnaIz+ As mentioned above, the activity and concentration terms in Eqs. (1) and (2) are phase boundary activities. It is, therefore, intrinsically assumed that no concentration polarizations take place in the diffusion layers contacting the sample-membrane interface. Under these conditions, a Nernst response is observed also if the potential is plotted versus the bulk sample activity.\nIon-selective electrodes are intrinsically passive analytical devices where no excitation signal is used to stimulate/perturb the ionic concentration profiles in the system. Therefore, such sensors are often found to respond to ion activities rather than concentrations. Moreover, higher charges z I of the measured analyte will invariably lead to lower electrode sensitivities, as dictated by Eq. (2). This makes it difficult to design ISEs for analytes other than ions that are not highly charged. In many cases, however, ion-selective electrodes are found to respond differently, and some of these limitations can be overcome by working in a non-classical mode. Obviously, chemical perturbations with such passive systems must occur under zero-current conditions. Membranes may undergo spontaneous transport processes on the basis of chemical concentration gradients. Neutral species can freely partition into these membranes and lead to local concentration polarizations. Ions may also be transported across the membrane on the basis of codiffusion and counter-diffusion principles . Again, such processes may lead to phase boundary concentration perturbations at the sample-membrane interface. In all of these systems, Eq. (1) remains valid but the phase boundary activities/concentrations are not equal to the bulk composition of the membrane. In many cases, such perturbations may seem an experimental nuisance that need to be eliminated. One example is the development of ion-selective electrodes for use in trace level analysis. A locally elevated ion concentration at the interface, for example, will prohibit the effective measurement of dilute samples. Remedies to this obstacle must be found chemically by choosing appropriate membrane and inner filling solution formulations that will reduce this effect. On the other hand, perturbations may also be induced purposely for a number of reasons. In the following sections, several novel analytical approaches that make use or eliminate accumulation and depletion processes will be discussed. In addition, a number of other special cases that also function non-classically, yet have interesting analytical applications, will also be reviewed.\nConventional polymer membrane ion-selective electrodes yield detection limits around the micromolar range as determined according to the 1976 IUPAC recommendations . Since these sensors have traditionally been developed for blood electrolyte analysis, where concentrations are typically in the millimolar range, this has not been a very important issue. In recent years, however, interest in trace analysis has grown, and ionophores have been synthesized for heavy-metal ion analysis with potential for real-world environmental applications. Some researchers have stated that voltammetric ionophore-based sensors would intrinsically have an advantage in terms of achieving trace level sensitivities , but no careful study has been performed to prove this notion.\nVery recently, substantial advances have been achieved in lowering the detection limit of ionophore-based ion-selective electrodes by understanding and eliminating the reasons that lead to local phase boundary concentration perturbations at the sample\u2013membrane interface. Initial efforts focused on studying the effect of the inner electrolyte concentration on the detection limit . Simple models predict that ionophore-based membranes will always uptake a given concentration of electrolyte from the contacting aqueous solutions by an ionophore-mediated coextraction process. Since traditional inner filling solution compositions are relatively concentrated, it can be easily envisioned that a steady-state concentration polarization will take place within the membrane that leads to a continuous zero-current flux of electrolyte from the inner electrolyte to a dilute sample. Indeed, it was found for potassium ion-selective membranes based on valinomycin that the detection limit depends strongly on the concentration of the inner electrolyte, and that sample stirring would lead to more effective mass transport away from the interface, which also yields lower detection limits . In the case of Ag+electrodes based on a lipophilic dithiocarbamate ionophore, it was shown that a simple variation of the inner electrolyte concentration leads to a substantial reduction in the detection limits from 3\u00d710\u22125 to about 10\u22128 M . Very soon after these experiments, Sokalski et al. showed the first evidence that metal ion buffered inner electrolyte compositions yielded detection limits for Pb2+ selective electrodes around the picomolar range (see Fig. 1 ) . These phenomenal advances have recently been explained with a steady-state model . Evidently, it is not sufficient to merely reduce the concentration of the inner electrolyte to achieve low detection limit measurements. Even an otherwise unremarkable exchange of analyte ions from the membrane with other competing ions from the sample will lead to a concentration polarization within the membrane and to a substantial net ion flux into the sample according to a counter-diffusion process. This process can be counteracted to some extent by providing a partial ion exchange at the inner membrane side as well, thereby further reducing the detection limit. While a substantial exchange at the inner side leads to even lower potentials, it may increase the risk of depleting the sample locally at the sample/membrane interface. Since this effect depends on the conditioning time and procedure, history of the electrode, and sample contact time, extremely low detection limits in the picomolar range are currently quite difficult to achieve reproducibly.\nThe different principles that are assumed to control zero-current ion fluxes across ion-selective membranes are depicted in Fig. 2 . With careful optimization of ion-exchange and coextraction reactions at both interfaces of the membrane , sensors with high selectivity can now be used reliably for measurements in the sub-micromolar to nanomolar concentration range. Newer studies have also explored a galvanostatic measuring mode for these membranes, where a small applied current can control the electrochemical ion flux across the membrane that optimally counteracts the spontaneous zero-current ion fluxes . This technique could be conveniently used to fine-tune a chemically optimized system for a practical analytical situation, but requires a more elaborate experimental setup. The accomplishment of understanding and dramatically minimizing the detection limit of ISEs is especially important in speciation analysis, since ISEs are certainly the most promising tools for free ion activity measurements. It will also provide increased motivation for the synthesis of new ionophores for ions that must be measured at trace levels .\nIt must be strongly emphasized that spontaneous interfacial analyte accumulation processes in dilute samples have, historically, also prohibited the reliable determination of membrane selectivities. If substantial amounts of analyte ions are displaced from the membrane during a reconditioning process to determine selectivity coefficients, the membrane effectively responds at the interface to a mixed ion sample. In the worst case, the measured potential values are completely independent of the interfering ion concentration, while apparent sub-Nernstian response slopes are normally observed. This has produced a substantial amount of ill-defined selectivity data in the literature, and, for this reason, it will be important to reevaluate many reported membrane selectivities in the future. Fortunately, new convenient methods to determine the underlying selectivity of ISE membranes have become available. They eliminate the above mentioned experimental bias by using (1) metal ion buffered samples ; (2) ion-selective membranes that are conditioned with a highly discriminated ion solution ; and (3) membranes with high fluxes of analyte ions in direction of the inner electrolyte . In many cases, selectivity coefficients can vary by over 10 orders of magnitude depending on the chosen method (see Fig. 3 ). A number of articles have recently been written on this issue that will aid the reader to adapt these new techniques to their own experimental work .\nIt is well known that ISEs respond to sample activities and not concentrations of ions, which stands in contrast to most other analytical methods. Nonetheless, it has been documented in the literature that the activities at the membrane surface and in the bulk of the solution may considerably differ both for solid-state and solvent polymeric membranes . As described above, such differences are often responsible for the lower limits of detection since the dissolution of the solid membrane or leaching from the polymeric membrane induces local activities that are independent of further dilution of the sample. Large zero-current ion fluxes are observed by using inner reference solutions that, through ion-exchange at the inner membrane surface, induce maximum gradients of primary ions toward the inner compartment. This leads to a reduced concentration at the membrane surface of the sample side. Naturally, such effects are especially strong at low sample activities where apparently super-Nernstian response curves are observed. Ceresa et al. have recently shown that it is possible to use ISEs with a strong flux of the primary ion to the inner compartment to measure total concentrations if the sample ion is complexed with a chelator . The essence of this method is that in the presence of a complexing agent the net flux of the ions is larger than expected from the diffusion of the uncomplexed ions alone. Mass transport is then dictated by the diffusion of the complexed metal ions to the sensing surface if the kinetics of decomplexation are rapid relative to that of diffusion. At the membrane surface, the free ion concentration will readily adjust as a direct function of the total ion concentration at the surface according the metal ion buffer equilibrium. Relative to a classical electrode, therefore, the free ion concentration decrease at the membrane surface is directly proportional to the total concentration decrease. In such cases, the electrode is essentially responsive to the available total ion concentration. The concept was introduced with EDTA buffered samples that contained variable total concentrations of calcium but all the same free concentration of 5\u00d710\u22128 M . The resulting EMF values were practically identical for classical ISEs, but varied by nearly 100 mV with a membrane optimized to measure total concentrations (see Fig. 4 ).\nIt was recently found that elevated acetic acid concentrations (up to 1 M) in the inner electrolyte of a tridodecylamine based pH electrode lead to such massive acetic acid transport across the membrane that non-linear pH characteristics where found even in well buffered samples . This suggests that ISE membranes can chemically modify the surface pH at the sample side. This principle could be used to purposely alter measuring conditions without having to modify the bulk sample composition, which has promise for a variety of applications where control of the sample pH (or another ionic parameter) is important for optimal sensor response. Such acidification has been suggested to be useful for measuring total concentrations since the pH decrease could, in principle, locally dissociate metal complexes and convert complexed ions to free ones .\nSensitivity is defined as the ratio between the changes in signal and analyte activity. Traditional ISEs respond according to the Nernst equation (Eq. (2)). This means that the electrode sensitivity decreases with increasing charge z I of the analyte ion. While an EMF change of about 59 mV is observed for every 10-fold activity change of a monovalent ion, half that is expected for a divalent ion, while a mere 1 mV is calculated for a polyionic analyte with a charge of about 60. Conventional use of ISEs is based on equilibrium partitioning of analyte ions at the phase boundary of a sample and ISE membrane. The resulting responses are Nernstian (Eq. (2)) because the uncomplexed ion activity in the organic phase boundary, a I(org), is sample-independent. However, it also follows from Eq. (1) that linear but apparently \u2018non-Nernstian\u2019 EMF responses are obtained if a I(org) varies linearly with a I(aq) . Buhlmann et al. have shown that apparently \u2018twice-Nernstian\u2019 responses of approximately +58 mV/decade for Ba2+ and Ca2+-selective electrodes could be explained with an inverse relationship between a I(aq) and a I(org) (see Fig. 5 ). Such unusual EMF responses were experimentally obtained with ISE membranes containing anionic sites and acidic ionophores, the latter either in their protonated form or as 1:1 complexes with I2+ in their deprotonated form . The changes in a I(org) that give rise to the apparently \u2018non-Nernstian responses\u2019 are the result of minute changes in the membrane composition due to I2+/2H+ ion exchange between the sample and membrane phases . However, within the range of the apparently \u2018twice-Nernstian\u2019 response, the concentrations of the major membrane species are not affected appreciably by this ion exchange. As a result, the response times of these electrodes are as fast as those of ISEs that exhibit Nernstian responses.\nUnlike other examples of super-Nernstian EMF responses (see next section), these apparently non-Nernstian responses are based on phase boundary equilibria. Understanding them theoretically is not only relevant for the optimization of certain ISEs that unintentionally exhibit \u2018non-Nernstian\u2019 responses but may also help to improve the discrimination of interfering ions by changing the response slope for the primary ion. The concept can be generalized to describe half- and triple Nernstian responses as well.\nAmong the various non-equilibrium potentiometric sensors described in this review, polyion sensors based on polymeric membranes (e.g. plasticized poly(vinyl chloride)) doped with appropriate lipophilic ion-exchangers, have the most diverse and potential real-world analytical applications, especially in the biomedical arena . Indeed, such devices have been shown to exhibit significant non-equilibrium potentiometric response to a number of biologically important polyionic species (e.g. heparin, protamine, polyphosphates, DNA, etc.) at sub-\u03bcM levels in samples as complex as whole blood . Moreover, the non-equilibrium EMF response observed is highly dependent on the molecule weight of the polyion, and this knowledge already has led to the application these sensors for monitoring specific enzyme activities and enzyme inhibitors .\nOne of the first reported polyion sensitive membrane electrodes was described by Ma et al. for the detection of the polyanionic anticoagulant heparin (see Fig. 6 ). This electrode employed PVC membranes formulated with tridodeylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC), a classical lipophilic anion exchanger, as the membrane active component. While analogous anion and cation exchanger-based membrane electrodes had been investigated with respect to their EMF response to small inorganic ions and larger organic anions since the early 1970s, no previous efforts focused on examining the behavior of such devices in the presence of polyanionic species. At first glance, the prospects of a membrane electrode exhibiting large analytically useful EMF response to polyions would seem improbable on two counts. First, given the high charge and hydrophilicity of the polysaccharide structure of heparin, one would not anticipate favorable extraction of this species from an aqueous solution into the low dielectric membrane phase of the electrode. Second, considering the average charge on macromolecular heparin (\u221270), even if the equilibrium ion-exchange of heparin with the original counter anions in the membrane phase (e.g. chloride in the case of TDMAC) were favorable, the classical Nernst equation would predict impractically low slopes for a membrane phase boundary in equilibrium with the sample solution (<1 mV/decade). However, the preliminary experiments reported by Ma et al. showed that relatively large (>50 mV) changes in the electrode EMF value occurred when rather low concentrations of heparin (0.3 \u03bcM) were added to the sample phase in the presence of 0.1 M chloride ion.\nFurther observations with the original heparin sensitive membranes , and subsequent efforts to devise an analogous potentiometric sensor for the polycationic drug protamine (used as antidote for heparin, see structure in Fig. 6) first using tetraphenylborates , and then later dinonylnapthalene sulfonate (DNNS) as the membrane active species, provided a much clearer picture regarding the non-equilibrium response mechanism of both systems . In fact, it was found that the EMF response to polyions changes substantially in quiescent versus stirred solutions. Further, the magnitude of response and detection range for given polyions was found to vary considerably depending on the composition of the polymer film (e.g. polymer/plasticizer ratio which changes the diffusion coefficient of species within the membrane phase; see Fig. 7 for polyanion sensor), concentration of lipophilic exchanger, and the electrode membrane geometry, with cylindrical designs yielding response at lower concentrations of polyions than corresponding planar configurations. In addition, it was found that both polyanion and polycation response occurred over a relatively low (sub-\u03bcM) and narrow (1 decade in concentration) range of the polyion, with a saturation type response at higher concentrations of the polyion. In fact, if the electrodes were conditioned in solution containing polyion for extended periods of time, the theoretical and very shallow Nernst response toward the respective polyions is observed (see Fig. 7).\nTaken together, these observations enabled Fu et al. to propose that the polyion response of appropriately formulated polymeric membranes can be attributed to a highly selective non-equilibrium extraction of the polyion into the membrane phase via a cooperative ion-pairing interaction with the lipophilic ion-exchangers . This extraction process leads to a steady-state change in the phase boundary potential at the membrane/sample interface, which is observed only when the bulk of the membrane is initially void of polyion. For example, membranes prepared with TDMAC rapidly exchange chloride for certain polyanions and, thus, exhibit very large potentiometric responses to such species (including porcine and beef lung heparin), with the magnitude of response dependent on both the chain length and anion charge density of the polyanion structure . In contrast, polymer membranes containing tetraphenylborate derivatives or DNNS respond potentiometrically to low levels of polycations as well as synthetic peptides rich in arginine residues via a cation exchange process that leads to the formation of strong ion-pairs between the cation exchange sites and the polycation. For both polyanion and polycation sensitive membranes, it has been found that the detection range toward the analyte polyion can be altered merely by changing the diffusion coefficients of the polyion-ion-exchanger complex within the membrane phase (via changes in the polymer/plasticizer ratio; see Fig. 7).\nIn the regime of non-equilibrium response (at lower sample concentrations of the polyion), a steady-state situation exists at the membrane/sample interface, where the flux of polyion to the surface is equal to the flux of the polyion-exchanger ion pairs into the bulk of the polymeric membrane. The change in EMF in this concentration regime is given by the following equation for polyanion response : \u0394EMF=RTFln1\u2212zDa\u03b4mRTDm\u03b4acpolyion where \u0394EMF is the change in membrane potential after addition of the polyion to the sample phase (usually measured after 2 min) at a concentration equal to c polyion, z is the absolute charge on the polyion, D and \u03b4 are the diffusion coefficients and diffusion layer thicknesses in the membrane (m) and aqueous sample (a) phases, respectively, and R T is the concentration of ion-exchange sites in the organic membrane phase (i.e. TDMAC concentration in the case of polyanion sensing or DNNS concentration for polycation sensors). For a polycation response, positive potential differences are observed with otherwise the same Eq. (3). In practice, D m is determined by the membrane composition (plasticizer/polymer ratio), \u03b4 a is controlled by the stirring rate in the sample phase and R T is dictated by the wt.% of exchanger added to the membrane formulation. Each of these parameters can be changed to vary the concentration range of polyion that is detected via the non-equilibrium response .\nEq. (3) is only valid in a sensing regime where the response toward the polyion is kinetic in nature (i.e. non-equilibrium; there is still some chloride or sodium ions present in the outermost layer of the membrane) and in a sample concentration range of polyion where extraction of the polyion is favorable (dependent on structure of polyion and strength of ion-pairing with exchanger in the membrane phase). At high concentrations of polyion, or after very long exposure time (t), the membrane/sample interface is at true equilibrium with respect to polyion extraction (although the bulk of the membrane may not yet be at equilibrium). Hence, the potential change upon addition of a relatively high concentration of the polyion (>10\u22126 M) provides information about the thermodynamics of polyion extraction into the ion-exchanger doped organic films. In fact, it has been found that the thermodynamics of ion pairing for polyanions with the TDMA species varies considerably based on the charge density of the polyion and its molecular weight . Bovine heparin, with the highest charge density of any polyanionic species, has been found to yield the largest EMF response in the case of membranes doped with TDMAC. It should also be noted that the magnitude of EMF response is also dependent on the specific structure of the lipophilic ion-exchanger utilized to formulate the membranes. In the case of polyanion sensors, TDMA is much preferred to other species, with the short methyl group on one side of the nitrogen enabling enhanced electrostatic interactions of the exchanger with polyanions, while the long dodecyl chains can interact by van der Waals forces to enhance cooperative ion pairing along the polyanion chain. Similarly, DNNS is preferred as the cation exchanger for polycation sensors owing the ability of this species to condense along the surface of polycations, with \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between adjacent DNNS structures further stabilizing the ion paring reaction.\nPolyion sensors for more industrial type polyions, such as polystyrene sulfonates (PSS) have also been described. Ohki et al. showed that PVC membrane doped with alkyl-diphosphonium type exchangers yields significant response to PSS, while Hattori and Kato reported on the EMF response toward PSS of PVC membranes prepared with tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride. While no discussion of the response mechanism was provided in these reports, based on the sigmoidal type response patterned observed by Hattori and Kato, it would appear that the PSS response of such electrodes is also clearly dependent on a non-equilibrium extraction process.\nOne immediate application of potentiometric polyion sensors is in the determination of heparin levels in whole blood samples from patients undergoing open heart surgery. Heparin is the most widely used anticoagulant in major surgical procedures and in extracorporeal procedures such as hemodialysis. Heparin doses given to patients during bypass surgery are typically in the range of 2\u20138 U/ml (0.4\u20131.6 \u03bcM). However, it is essential to monitor the anticoagulant effect of heparin during surgery, since higher doses of heparin are often associated with the risk of hemorrhage. Such heparin determinations can be readily performed via titrations with protamine . Protamine binds stoichiometrically, via electrostatic interactions with heparin. Since the polyion sensors respond only to free polyions (during the time course of a typical measurement) and not the complexed form, they can serve as convenient end-point detectors for such titrations. In early studies, blood heparin levels were determined with good accuracy via a pseudo-titration method using the TDMAC-based heparin sensitive electrode . A direct titration could not be employed in this case due to the irreversibility of the polyion electrode\u2019s response after exposure to a sample containing heparin. The pseudo-titrations were performed by adding small volumes (250 \u03bcl) of blood to a series of tubes containing known, increasing amounts of protamine. The potentiometric response of the polyanion-sensitive electrode was monitored upon sequentially switching the electrode from the tube containing the highest to the least amount of protamine. A decrease in potential was observed in those tubes where the heparin present in the blood was in excess of the protamine in that tube. The end-point of the titration was then determined by extrapolating the two linear regions of the titration curve.\nMore recently, DNNS-based cylindrical protamine sensitive electrodes (cylindrical to improve flux of polyion to surface and thereby lower detection limit) were used to perform direct titrations of heparin in buffered saline and blood, via addition of small aliquots of protamine to the heparinized sample . Consequently, the titrations are much simpler to perform when compared with the earlier pseudo-titrations using the polyanion-sensitive electrode. Fig. 8 A illustrates the typical potentiometric titration curves observed for varying heparin levels in a buffer solution, while Fig. 8B shows the results for the titration of a whole blood sample spiked with varying levels of heparin. Although the magitude of EMF response in blood is diminished compared to that in buffer, the end points of such titrations yield very good quantitative agreement with the levels of heparin present as determined by a commercial protamine titration method based on a clotting endpoint (non-electrochemical). This was demonstrated conclusively by Ramamurthy et al. who evaluated the performance of this simple titration method for quantitating the levels of heparin in the blood of patients undergoing heart by-pass surgery.\nPolyion-sensitive electrodes have also been proven to be a useful tool in the development of novel electrochemical enzyme assays. Indeed, Yun et al. first demonstrated the possibility of determining the activity of enzymes that cleave polyionic molecules into smaller fragments using an early polycation sensor based on tetraphenylborate . Since the EMF response of these electrodes is highly dependent on MW, cleavage of polyion substrates into smaller fragments leads to a reduced response toward the original polyion. In fact, Yun et al. showed that this approach could be used to detect trypsin, an enzyme that cleaves arginine rich peptides into smaller fragments . A reversal of the EMF response was recorded in real time after the enzyme was added to a protamine solution (see Fig. 9 for general protease assay with polycation sensor detection). The initial rate of potential decrease was shown to be proportional toward the trypsin activity. Further, it has been shown by Han et al. that synthetic polycationic peptides (rich in arginine) can be utilized to devise more selective substrates for given proteases (e.g. chymotrypsin and renin), and that the response of the DNNS-based membrane electrode toward these synthetic substrates is nearly as large as protamine. This approach is based upon incorporating a specific amino acid (or sequence of amino acids) cleavage site within a larger polycationic peptide structure, such that the action of the specific protease will selectively hydrolyze the larger peptide into smaller fragments toward which the membrane electrode exhibits far less potentiometric response (due to poor extraction compared to the initial larger polycationic substrate).\nThis general method of detecting enzyme activities is not limited to polycationic substrates. Indeed, Esson and Meyerhoff showed that a TDMAC-based polyanion sensor could be used in conjunction with polyphosphate and oligomer nucleotides as polyanionic substrates for the detection of acid phosphatase and RNase activities, respectively. Badr and Meyerhoff further expanded the application of polyion sensors by demonstrating their feasibility to monitor levels of trypsin-like protease inhibitors (\u03b11: antiproteinase inhibitor, \u03b12: macroglobulin, aprotinin and soybean inhibitor) . The hydrolysis of protamine upon the addition of proteinase-antiproteinase inhibitor test solutions was monitored in real-time using a DNNS-based polycation sensor. An effective assay for monitoring aprotinin (a plasmin inhibitor drug used to prevent post-operative bleeding in coronary bypass patients) levels in plasma samples using this approach was devised.\nPolyion sensitive membrane electrodes represent one new class of electrochemical devices that function via a non-equilibrium potentiometric response mechanism. This mechanism coupled with the favorable ion-pairing of polyions with lipophilic ion-exchangers in the membrane phases of such devices can limit there reuse of such sensors, and encourages employment of single-use disposable devices for most routine measurements (e.g. for potentiometric titrations, etc.). However, recent work by Mathison and Bakker have shown that it is possible to rapidly regenerate the surface layers of the polyion sensors by incorporating appropriate proton ionophores within the same sensing films, and equilibrating the sensor in a high pH buffer between sequential measurements with the same electrode. This is potentially a very attractive approach, and could further lead to even more diverse applications of these novel devices.\nPotentiometric sensors are traditionally ill-suited for the measurement of neutral species since changes in the charge separation at the sample-membrane interface are required for a potentiometric response. It is, however, well known that neutral species can be detected potentiometrically if they influence the spontaneous distribution of an electrically charged species. A classical, well documented example is the potentiometric response of solid-state heavy-metal ISEs to ligands, such as ammonia or cyanide. The complexation of the metal with these ligands changes their free concentration in the sample, which is detected potentiometrically.\nPolymeric membrane ISEs for neutral surfactants have been developed based on the same principle . The surfactant spontaneously extracts into the membrane phase that typically contains the barium salt of a tetraphenylborate derivative. Since the surfactant complexes cations in the membrane, it decreases the barium ion activity in the membrane and this gives rise to a large potentiometric response. Espadas-Torre et al. and Malinowska and Meyerhoff further studied how the presence of neutral surfactants (such as triton-X 100, Brij-20, etc.) affect the selectivity of neutral ionophore-based membranes for various cations. They found that the presence of such surfactants can dramatically decrease the selectivity of the membrane electrodes, owing to partitioning of surfactant into the membrane and a concomitant enhanced extraction of interferent cations as complexes with these polyether based surfactants.\nIto et al. have recently offered a well founded theoretical and experimental investigation on the unusual potentiometric response of ISE membranes to lipophilic phenols that may serve as a further basis for sensor development for electrically neutral analytes . In their system, polymeric membranes are doped with a lipophilic quaternary ammonium salt. It is observed that phenols are primarily extracted into the membrane in their neutral form. However, they can partially dissociate within the membrane phase to give the phenolate, ion paired by the quaternary ammonium cations. The resulting strong acid (H+ and the anion A\u2212 of the quaternary ammonium salt) is now expelled from the membrane. This results in a net charge transfer process that gives rise to a change in the membrane potential, with apparent super-Nernstian response slopes (see Fig. 10 ). As with the apparently twice-Nernstian response slopes (Section 2.4), such rather complex partitioning principles may, in fact, result in the design of new sensing principles.\nOne of the more unusual non-equilibrium potentiometric devices reported to date is a polymer membrane electrode that responds with apparent ion selectivity toward sulfite/bisulfite ions. As initially described by Pranitis and Meyerhoff , this membrane electrode is prepared by doping the neutral bis(diethyldithiocarbamato)mercury (II) complex (Hg(DTC)2 (see Fig. 11 ) within a typical plasticized PVC membrane. When assembled in a classical ISE arrangement, the electrode displays significant potentiometric response to sulfite ions (Fig. 11) with the slope highly dependent on the concentration of Hg(DTC)2 used to formulate the membrane. At concentrations >1 wt.%, response toward sulfite is typically near Nernstian (25\u201330 mV/decade) over the range of 10\u22126\u201310\u22123 M sulfite when tested in sample solutions consisting of a phosphate buffer, pH 10.0. However, when the pH of the test sample is buffered at pH. 6.0, much higher slopes to added sulfite are observed (50\u201355 mV/decade), presumably because of a concomitant potentiometric response toward bisulfite. Selectivity over a wide range of other anions, such as chloride, acetate, citrate, perchlorate, salicylate, nitrite and carbonate/bicarbonate is excellent (log K pot<\u22124). In contrast, significant responses to bromide, thiocyanide, and thiosulfate are observed, and exceptionally large interferences from sulfide and iodide prevent applications in the presence of these species .\nBased on these response characteristics, Pranitis and Meyerhoff originally postulated that the Hg(DTC)2 might be serving as a neutral carrier type ionophore within the PVC membranes, with sulfite binding either to a fifth coordination site on the Hg(II) ion, or more likely, sulfite replacing one the thiocarbonyl sulfur atoms that is originally coordinated to the Hg(II). Subsequent studies by Badr and Meyerhoff revealed a very different picture regarding the mechanism of potentiometric response. First, if the response was due to Hg(DTC)2 serving as a neutral carrier, addition of lipophilic cationic sites (e.g. quaternary ammonium salts) to the membrane should yield improved response and selectivity toward sulfite. However, response toward sulfite was actually degraded in the presence of added tridodecylmethylammonium ions suggesting an alternate mechanism.\nSeveral factors pointed toward a non-equilibrium reaction type response mechanism for the Hg(DTC)2\u2212-based sulfite electrode. First, it was found that the response slope toward sulfite actually decreased significantly when the electrode was in contact with sample solutions containing sulfite ions for extended time periods (e.g. 10 h). Since the Hg(DTC)2 complex is lipophilic, such loss in sulfite response could not be attributed to substantial leakage of the ionophore from the membrane. In addition, the degree of convective mixing in the sample solution was shown to affect the measured EMF value, with a significant increase in EMF (toward apparently less sulfite) as the stirring rate was decreased. This observation suggested that mass transport of sulfite to the membrane/sample interface plays a major role in the observed EMF response, analogous to observations made previously with non-equilibrium polyion sensors . Further, the response slope toward sulfite was shown to increase dramatically when the plasticizer content of the membrane was increased. Increasing plasticizer content greatly enhances the diffusion coefficient of the carrier in the membrane phase, and this observation further supported a non-equilibrium, steady-state response process.\nThe mechanism of the sulfite sensor was clarified further when it was found that the addition of a reducing agent, such as Sn(II) yielded anionic response, similar to that found for sulfite. Taken together, these observations suggested that the response to sulfite (as well as Sn(II), I\u2212, S2\u2212, and S2O4 2\u2212) of membranes doped with Hg(DTC)2 is due to a heterogeneous redox reaction at the membrane/sample interface. In the case of sulfite, it reacts with Hg(DTC)2 at the interface to form a Hg(I) complex with the DTC ligand, sulfate ion, and free negatively charged DTC ligands. This surface reaction scheme is illustrated in Fig. 12 . The production of negatively charged DTC ligands in the organic phase leads to a steady-state change in the phase boundary potential EMF value at the membrane sample interface, with the membrane becoming more negatively charged relative to the sample solution. With continued exposure to the reducing agent, sulfite, the membrane becomes depleted of the original Hg(DTC)2 complex, and the majority of the DTC is complexed with Hg(I); hence, little or no potentiometric response to added sulfite is observed after such prolonged exposure. However, with fresh membranes, the rate of sulfite mass transport to the surface of the membrane, coupled with the rate of Hg(DTC)2 complex diffusion within the membrane to the surface and loss of free anionic DTC ligand from the organic membrane (to the aqueous sample phase) will dictate the ultimate steady-state condition of charge separation at the membrane/sample interface due to the heterogeneous redox reaction.\nDespite the unusual non-equilibrium/redox reaction response mechanism, the sulfite sensors based on Hg(DTC)2 can be analytically useful. To enhance the practical selectivity of the device, the electrode was used as a down-stream potentiometric detector in flow-injection SO2 gas sensing system . Samples containing sulfite/bisulfite are injected into a sulfuric acid solution carrier stream, where proportional amounts of SO2 gas are generated. The gas then diffuses through a gas permeable membrane into a recipient solution (pH 5.0 or greater) where bisulfite/sulfite is formed from the diffusing gas. The Hg(DTC)2-based polymer membrane electrode then detects the bisulfite/sulfite in this recipient stream. The gas permeable membrane eliminates interferences from the other reducing agents that were shown to interfere greatly with the original membrane electrode. Such a flow-injection system was applied for measurement of sulfite/bisulfite level in various wine samples and results correlated quite well with a pararosaniline-based spectrophotometric method.\nOf course, as with any other non-equilibrium type potentiometric device, achieving reproducible analytical signals with the sulfite/bisulfite sensor based on polymer membranes doped with Hg(DTC)2 requires that mass transfer of the analyte species in the solution phase be carefully controlled from sample to sample. This is accomplished nicely in the FIA system via the controlled flow rate of recipient stream, and use of a tubular form of the polymer membrane electrode as an in-stream detector. Further, in the case of the sulfite/bisulfite sensor, one can expect a deterioration in the observed responses toward the analyte with time, as more and more of the original Hg(DTC)2 complex is reduced. Hence, frequent re-calibration of the system is mandatory, and replacement of the membrane electrode will be required after a finite number of test samples. Fortunately, when employed in an FIA mode, the contact time with the sulfite/bisulfite in the sample is relatively short; hence, it is likely that many hundreds of samples could be determined before significant degradation in the non-equilibrium/redox reaction EMF signal would be observed.\nIonophore-based polymeric membrane electrodes have now been in routine use for nearly 30 years. Hence, this research area may be viewed by many as a rather mature analytical technology. However, the recent developments in this field highlighted within this review clearly suggest a somewhat different picture. A new understanding of what factors control detection limits (ion fluxes) and measured selectivity of such devices, how EMF responses to non-charged and highly charged polyionic species can be observed, what conditions are required to obtain non-classical super-Nernstian responses, and the potentiometric detection of ions by redox reactions at ionophore-doped polymer membrane/sample interface rather than conventional ion-exchange are all new, exciting areas of basic research that have fundamental as well as practical analytical significance. Indeed, one only needs to read the recent literature cited herein to clearly see that what was thought to be impossible or improbable only a few years ago with respect to simple membrane electrode technology, is now quite feasible. Whether it be measuring ions at sub-nanomolar levels in environmental samples using ion gradients across appropriatly formulated membranes, or the detection of important biological polyions complex biological samples via non-equilibrium potentiometric measurements, there is certainly a vast new array of concepts and sensor design strategies that will continue to make ionophore-based membrane electrodes an attractive analytical methodology for research and applications into the next millennium.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Potentiometric ionophore-based membrane sensors are a preferred measuring tool for a variety of applications. Since the binding selectivity of the lipophilic ionophore dictates, for the most part, the ion-exchange selectivity of the membrane, large cation and anion selectivity variations can be achieved by suitable choice of the ionophore. In fact, ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for as many as 60 analytes have been described thus far . A large number of novel and analytically useful ionophores have been discovered only in the past few years, indicating that this field is steadily moving forward . These ionophores are now also used to fabricate optical and voltammetric/amperometric sensors based on analogous membrane materials.\nThe response mechanism of classical polymeric membrane based ion-selective electrodes is now well understood, and appropriate simplifications of the theory have allowed more scientists to corroborate their experimental findings theoretically. It is now well established that ISEs exhibit Nernstian responses only if the membrane composition remains approximately invariant to sample concentration changes. In addition, it is normally assumed that the aqueous phase boundary contacting the ISE membrane has a composition identical to the sample bulk. Under these circumstances, ISEs behave ideally and respond to ion activities according to the Nernst equation . In recent years, however, a number of interesting cases have been observed and exploited analytically that employ systems that function quite differently. With such nonclassical approaches, detection limits can be lowered, electrode sensitivities may be increased, new classes of analytes become measurable and ISEs can be made responsive to ion concentrations rather than activities. This review summarizes these latest developments and should provide motivation for further advances in these areas.\nThe theory of polymeric membrane ion-selective electrodes under zero-current conditions is traditionally subdivided into two phase boundary potentials and a membrane internal diffusion potential. The latter contribution has been shown to be small in most cases , so that the membrane potential E I is primarily a function of the interfacial potential at the sample\u2013membrane phase boundary: EI=E0+RTzIFlnkIaIz+[Iz+] where a I and [Iz I+] are the sample activity and membrane concentration of Iz I+ at that phase boundary, k I incorporates the free energy of transfer of the ion from the aqueous to the organic phase, and all other constant potential contributions are included in E 0 (including the internal phase boundary potential at the inner side of the membrane). The terms R, T, and F have their usual meanings. Ion-selective membranes are hydrophobic and have ion-exchange properties due to an added ion-exchanger sites, the ion-exchange properties of the ionophore itself, or ionic impurities of the membrane material. In such situations, the concentration of extractable sample ions is typically dictated by the concentration of the ion-exchanger in the membrane. If no interferences from other sample ions are observed, therefore, the membrane concentration of Iz I+ is approximately sample independent and Eq. (1) reduces to the Nernst equation EI=EI0+RTzIFlnaIz+ As mentioned above, the activity and concentration terms in Eqs. (1) and (2) are phase boundary activities. It is, therefore, intrinsically assumed that no concentration polarizations take place in the diffusion layers contacting the sample-membrane interface. Under these conditions, a Nernst response is observed also if the potential is plotted versus the bulk sample activity.\nIon-selective electrodes are intrinsically passive analytical devices where no excitation signal is used to stimulate/perturb the ionic concentration profiles in the system. Therefore, such sensors are often found to respond to ion activities rather than concentrations. Moreover, higher charges z I of the measured analyte will invariably lead to lower electrode sensitivities, as dictated by Eq. (2). This makes it difficult to design ISEs for analytes other than ions that are not highly charged. In many cases, however, ion-selective electrodes are found to respond differently, and some of these limitations can be overcome by working in a non-classical mode. Obviously, chemical perturbations with such passive systems must occur under zero-current conditions. Membranes may undergo spontaneous transport processes on the basis of chemical concentration gradients. Neutral species can freely partition into these membranes and lead to local concentration polarizations. Ions may also be transported across the membrane on the basis of codiffusion and counter-diffusion principles . Again, such processes may lead to phase boundary concentration perturbations at the sample-membrane interface. In all of these systems, Eq. (1) remains valid but the phase boundary activities/concentrations are not equal to the bulk composition of the membrane. In many cases, such perturbations may seem an experimental nuisance that need to be eliminated. One example is the development of ion-selective electrodes for use in trace level analysis. A locally elevated ion concentration at the interface, for example, will prohibit the effective measurement of dilute samples. Remedies to this obstacle must be found chemically by choosing appropriate membrane and inner filling solution formulations that will reduce this effect. On the other hand, perturbations may also be induced purposely for a number of reasons. In the following sections, several novel analytical approaches that make use or eliminate accumulation and depletion processes will be discussed. In addition, a number of other special cases that also function non-classically, yet have interesting analytical applications, will also be reviewed.\nConventional polymer membrane ion-selective electrodes yield detection limits around the micromolar range as determined according to the 1976 IUPAC recommendations . Since these sensors have traditionally been developed for blood electrolyte analysis, where concentrations are typically in the millimolar range, this has not been a very important issue. In recent years, however, interest in trace analysis has grown, and ionophores have been synthesized for heavy-metal ion analysis with potential for real-world environmental applications. Some researchers have stated that voltammetric ionophore-based sensors would intrinsically have an advantage in terms of achieving trace level sensitivities , but no careful study has been performed to prove this notion.\nVery recently, substantial advances have been achieved in lowering the detection limit of ionophore-based ion-selective electrodes by understanding and eliminating the reasons that lead to local phase boundary concentration perturbations at the sample\u2013membrane interface. Initial efforts focused on studying the effect of the inner electrolyte concentration on the detection limit . Simple models predict that ionophore-based membranes will always uptake a given concentration of electrolyte from the contacting aqueous solutions by an ionophore-mediated coextraction process. Since traditional inner filling solution compositions are relatively concentrated, it can be easily envisioned that a steady-state concentration polarization will take place within the membrane that leads to a continuous zero-current flux of electrolyte from the inner electrolyte to a dilute sample. Indeed, it was found for potassium ion-selective membranes based on valinomycin that the detection limit depends strongly on the concentration of the inner electrolyte, and that sample stirring would lead to more effective mass transport away from the interface, which also yields lower detection limits . In the case of Ag+electrodes based on a lipophilic dithiocarbamate ionophore, it was shown that a simple variation of the inner electrolyte concentration leads to a substantial reduction in the detection limits from 3\u00d710\u22125 to about 10\u22128 M . Very soon after these experiments, Sokalski et al. showed the first evidence that metal ion buffered inner electrolyte compositions yielded detection limits for Pb2+ selective electrodes around the picomolar range (see Fig. 1 ) . These phenomenal advances have recently been explained with a steady-state model . Evidently, it is not sufficient to merely reduce the concentration of the inner electrolyte to achieve low detection limit measurements. Even an otherwise unremarkable exchange of analyte ions from the membrane with other competing ions from the sample will lead to a concentration polarization within the membrane and to a substantial net ion flux into the sample according to a counter-diffusion process. This process can be counteracted to some extent by providing a partial ion exchange at the inner membrane side as well, thereby further reducing the detection limit. While a substantial exchange at the inner side leads to even lower potentials, it may increase the risk of depleting the sample locally at the sample/membrane interface. Since this effect depends on the conditioning time and procedure, history of the electrode, and sample contact time, extremely low detection limits in the picomolar range are currently quite difficult to achieve reproducibly.\nThe different principles that are assumed to control zero-current ion fluxes across ion-selective membranes are depicted in Fig. 2 . With careful optimization of ion-exchange and coextraction reactions at both interfaces of the membrane , sensors with high selectivity can now be used reliably for measurements in the sub-micromolar to nanomolar concentration range. Newer studies have also explored a galvanostatic measuring mode for these membranes, where a small applied current can control the electrochemical ion flux across the membrane that optimally counteracts the spontaneous zero-current ion fluxes . This technique could be conveniently used to fine-tune a chemically optimized system for a practical analytical situation, but requires a more elaborate experimental setup. The accomplishment of understanding and dramatically minimizing the detection limit of ISEs is especially important in speciation analysis, since ISEs are certainly the most promising tools for free ion activity measurements. It will also provide increased motivation for the synthesis of new ionophores for ions that must be measured at trace levels .\nIt must be strongly emphasized that spontaneous interfacial analyte accumulation processes in dilute samples have, historically, also prohibited the reliable determination of membrane selectivities. If substantial amounts of analyte ions are displaced from the membrane during a reconditioning process to determine selectivity coefficients, the membrane effectively responds at the interface to a mixed ion sample. In the worst case, the measured potential values are completely independent of the interfering ion concentration, while apparent sub-Nernstian response slopes are normally observed. This has produced a substantial amount of ill-defined selectivity data in the literature, and, for this reason, it will be important to reevaluate many reported membrane selectivities in the future. Fortunately, new convenient methods to determine the underlying selectivity of ISE membranes have become available. They eliminate the above mentioned experimental bias by using (1) metal ion buffered samples ; (2) ion-selective membranes that are conditioned with a highly discriminated ion solution ; and (3) membranes with high fluxes of analyte ions in direction of the inner electrolyte . In many cases, selectivity coefficients can vary by over 10 orders of magnitude depending on the chosen method (see Fig. 3 ). A number of articles have recently been written on this issue that will aid the reader to adapt these new techniques to their own experimental work .\nIt is well known that ISEs respond to sample activities and not concentrations of ions, which stands in contrast to most other analytical methods. Nonetheless, it has been documented in the literature that the activities at the membrane surface and in the bulk of the solution may considerably differ both for solid-state and solvent polymeric membranes . As described above, such differences are often responsible for the lower limits of detection since the dissolution of the solid membrane or leaching from the polymeric membrane induces local activities that are independent of further dilution of the sample. Large zero-current ion fluxes are observed by using inner reference solutions that, through ion-exchange at the inner membrane surface, induce maximum gradients of primary ions toward the inner compartment. This leads to a reduced concentration at the membrane surface of the sample side. Naturally, such effects are especially strong at low sample activities where apparently super-Nernstian response curves are observed. Ceresa et al. have recently shown that it is possible to use ISEs with a strong flux of the primary ion to the inner compartment to measure total concentrations if the sample ion is complexed with a chelator . The essence of this method is that in the presence of a complexing agent the net flux of the ions is larger than expected from the diffusion of the uncomplexed ions alone. Mass transport is then dictated by the diffusion of the complexed metal ions to the sensing surface if the kinetics of decomplexation are rapid relative to that of diffusion. At the membrane surface, the free ion concentration will readily adjust as a direct function of the total ion concentration at the surface according the metal ion buffer equilibrium. Relative to a classical electrode, therefore, the free ion concentration decrease at the membrane surface is directly proportional to the total concentration decrease. In such cases, the electrode is essentially responsive to the available total ion concentration. The concept was introduced with EDTA buffered samples that contained variable total concentrations of calcium but all the same free concentration of 5\u00d710\u22128 M . The resulting EMF values were practically identical for classical ISEs, but varied by nearly 100 mV with a membrane optimized to measure total concentrations (see Fig. 4 ).\nIt was recently found that elevated acetic acid concentrations (up to 1 M) in the inner electrolyte of a tridodecylamine based pH electrode lead to such massive acetic acid transport across the membrane that non-linear pH characteristics where found even in well buffered samples . This suggests that ISE membranes can chemically modify the surface pH at the sample side. This principle could be used to purposely alter measuring conditions without having to modify the bulk sample composition, which has promise for a variety of applications where control of the sample pH (or another ionic parameter) is important for optimal sensor response. Such acidification has been suggested to be useful for measuring total concentrations since the pH decrease could, in principle, locally dissociate metal complexes and convert complexed ions to free ones .\nSensitivity is defined as the ratio between the changes in signal and analyte activity. Traditional ISEs respond according to the Nernst equation (Eq. (2)). This means that the electrode sensitivity decreases with increasing charge z I of the analyte ion. While an EMF change of about 59 mV is observed for every 10-fold activity change of a monovalent ion, half that is expected for a divalent ion, while a mere 1 mV is calculated for a polyionic analyte with a charge of about 60. Conventional use of ISEs is based on equilibrium partitioning of analyte ions at the phase boundary of a sample and ISE membrane. The resulting responses are Nernstian (Eq. (2)) because the uncomplexed ion activity in the organic phase boundary, a I(org), is sample-independent. However, it also follows from Eq. (1) that linear but apparently \u2018non-Nernstian\u2019 EMF responses are obtained if a I(org) varies linearly with a I(aq) . Buhlmann et al. have shown that apparently \u2018twice-Nernstian\u2019 responses of approximately +58 mV/decade for Ba2+ and Ca2+-selective electrodes could be explained with an inverse relationship between a I(aq) and a I(org) (see Fig. 5 ). Such unusual EMF responses were experimentally obtained with ISE membranes containing anionic sites and acidic ionophores, the latter either in their protonated form or as 1:1 complexes with I2+ in their deprotonated form . The changes in a I(org) that give rise to the apparently \u2018non-Nernstian responses\u2019 are the result of minute changes in the membrane composition due to I2+/2H+ ion exchange between the sample and membrane phases . However, within the range of the apparently \u2018twice-Nernstian\u2019 response, the concentrations of the major membrane species are not affected appreciably by this ion exchange. As a result, the response times of these electrodes are as fast as those of ISEs that exhibit Nernstian responses.\nUnlike other examples of super-Nernstian EMF responses (see next section), these apparently non-Nernstian responses are based on phase boundary equilibria. Understanding them theoretically is not only relevant for the optimization of certain ISEs that unintentionally exhibit \u2018non-Nernstian\u2019 responses but may also help to improve the discrimination of interfering ions by changing the response slope for the primary ion. The concept can be generalized to describe half- and triple Nernstian responses as well.\nAmong the various non-equilibrium potentiometric sensors described in this review, polyion sensors based on polymeric membranes (e.g. plasticized poly(vinyl chloride)) doped with appropriate lipophilic ion-exchangers, have the most diverse and potential real-world analytical applications, especially in the biomedical arena . Indeed, such devices have been shown to exhibit significant non-equilibrium potentiometric response to a number of biologically important polyionic species (e.g. heparin, protamine, polyphosphates, DNA, etc.) at sub-\u03bcM levels in samples as complex as whole blood . Moreover, the non-equilibrium EMF response observed is highly dependent on the molecule weight of the polyion, and this knowledge already has led to the application these sensors for monitoring specific enzyme activities and enzyme inhibitors .\nOne of the first reported polyion sensitive membrane electrodes was described by Ma et al. for the detection of the polyanionic anticoagulant heparin (see Fig. 6 ). This electrode employed PVC membranes formulated with tridodeylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC), a classical lipophilic anion exchanger, as the membrane active component. While analogous anion and cation exchanger-based membrane electrodes had been investigated with respect to their EMF response to small inorganic ions and larger organic anions since the early 1970s, no previous efforts focused on examining the behavior of such devices in the presence of polyanionic species. At first glance, the prospects of a membrane electrode exhibiting large analytically useful EMF response to polyions would seem improbable on two counts. First, given the high charge and hydrophilicity of the polysaccharide structure of heparin, one would not anticipate favorable extraction of this species from an aqueous solution into the low dielectric membrane phase of the electrode. Second, considering the average charge on macromolecular heparin (\u221270), even if the equilibrium ion-exchange of heparin with the original counter anions in the membrane phase (e.g. chloride in the case of TDMAC) were favorable, the classical Nernst equation would predict impractically low slopes for a membrane phase boundary in equilibrium with the sample solution (<1 mV/decade). However, the preliminary experiments reported by Ma et al. showed that relatively large (>50 mV) changes in the electrode EMF value occurred when rather low concentrations of heparin (0.3 \u03bcM) were added to the sample phase in the presence of 0.1 M chloride ion.\nFurther observations with the original heparin sensitive membranes , and subsequent efforts to devise an analogous potentiometric sensor for the polycationic drug protamine (used as antidote for heparin, see structure in Fig. 6) first using tetraphenylborates , and then later dinonylnapthalene sulfonate (DNNS) as the membrane active species, provided a much clearer picture regarding the non-equilibrium response mechanism of both systems . In fact, it was found that the EMF response to polyions changes substantially in quiescent versus stirred solutions. Further, the magnitude of response and detection range for given polyions was found to vary considerably depending on the composition of the polymer film (e.g. polymer/plasticizer ratio which changes the diffusion coefficient of species within the membrane phase; see Fig. 7 for polyanion sensor), concentration of lipophilic exchanger, and the electrode membrane geometry, with cylindrical designs yielding response at lower concentrations of polyions than corresponding planar configurations. In addition, it was found that both polyanion and polycation response occurred over a relatively low (sub-\u03bcM) and narrow (1 decade in concentration) range of the polyion, with a saturation type response at higher concentrations of the polyion. In fact, if the electrodes were conditioned in solution containing polyion for extended periods of time, the theoretical and very shallow Nernst response toward the respective polyions is observed (see Fig. 7).\nTaken together, these observations enabled Fu et al. to propose that the polyion response of appropriately formulated polymeric membranes can be attributed to a highly selective non-equilibrium extraction of the polyion into the membrane phase via a cooperative ion-pairing interaction with the lipophilic ion-exchangers . This extraction process leads to a steady-state change in the phase boundary potential at the membrane/sample interface, which is observed only when the bulk of the membrane is initially void of polyion. For example, membranes prepared with TDMAC rapidly exchange chloride for certain polyanions and, thus, exhibit very large potentiometric responses to such species (including porcine and beef lung heparin), with the magnitude of response dependent on both the chain length and anion charge density of the polyanion structure . In contrast, polymer membranes containing tetraphenylborate derivatives or DNNS respond potentiometrically to low levels of polycations as well as synthetic peptides rich in arginine residues via a cation exchange process that leads to the formation of strong ion-pairs between the cation exchange sites and the polycation. For both polyanion and polycation sensitive membranes, it has been found that the detection range toward the analyte polyion can be altered merely by changing the diffusion coefficients of the polyion-ion-exchanger complex within the membrane phase (via changes in the polymer/plasticizer ratio; see Fig. 7).\nIn the regime of non-equilibrium response (at lower sample concentrations of the polyion), a steady-state situation exists at the membrane/sample interface, where the flux of polyion to the surface is equal to the flux of the polyion-exchanger ion pairs into the bulk of the polymeric membrane. The change in EMF in this concentration regime is given by the following equation for polyanion response : \u0394EMF=RTFln1\u2212zDa\u03b4mRTDm\u03b4acpolyion where \u0394EMF is the change in membrane potential after addition of the polyion to the sample phase (usually measured after 2 min) at a concentration equal to c polyion, z is the absolute charge on the polyion, D and \u03b4 are the diffusion coefficients and diffusion layer thicknesses in the membrane (m) and aqueous sample (a) phases, respectively, and R T is the concentration of ion-exchange sites in the organic membrane phase (i.e. TDMAC concentration in the case of polyanion sensing or DNNS concentration for polycation sensors). For a polycation response, positive potential differences are observed with otherwise the same Eq. (3). In practice, D m is determined by the membrane composition (plasticizer/polymer ratio), \u03b4 a is controlled by the stirring rate in the sample phase and R T is dictated by the wt.% of exchanger added to the membrane formulation. Each of these parameters can be changed to vary the concentration range of polyion that is detected via the non-equilibrium response .\nEq. (3) is only valid in a sensing regime where the response toward the polyion is kinetic in nature (i.e. non-equilibrium; there is still some chloride or sodium ions present in the outermost layer of the membrane) and in a sample concentration range of polyion where extraction of the polyion is favorable (dependent on structure of polyion and strength of ion-pairing with exchanger in the membrane phase). At high concentrations of polyion, or after very long exposure time (t), the membrane/sample interface is at true equilibrium with respect to polyion extraction (although the bulk of the membrane may not yet be at equilibrium). Hence, the potential change upon addition of a relatively high concentration of the polyion (>10\u22126 M) provides information about the thermodynamics of polyion extraction into the ion-exchanger doped organic films. In fact, it has been found that the thermodynamics of ion pairing for polyanions with the TDMA species varies considerably based on the charge density of the polyion and its molecular weight . Bovine heparin, with the highest charge density of any polyanionic species, has been found to yield the largest EMF response in the case of membranes doped with TDMAC. It should also be noted that the magnitude of EMF response is also dependent on the specific structure of the lipophilic ion-exchanger utilized to formulate the membranes. In the case of polyanion sensors, TDMA is much preferred to other species, with the short methyl group on one side of the nitrogen enabling enhanced electrostatic interactions of the exchanger with polyanions, while the long dodecyl chains can interact by van der Waals forces to enhance cooperative ion pairing along the polyanion chain. Similarly, DNNS is preferred as the cation exchanger for polycation sensors owing the ability of this species to condense along the surface of polycations, with \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between adjacent DNNS structures further stabilizing the ion paring reaction.\nPolyion sensors for more industrial type polyions, such as polystyrene sulfonates (PSS) have also been described. Ohki et al. showed that PVC membrane doped with alkyl-diphosphonium type exchangers yields significant response to PSS, while Hattori and Kato reported on the EMF response toward PSS of PVC membranes prepared with tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride. While no discussion of the response mechanism was provided in these reports, based on the sigmoidal type response patterned observed by Hattori and Kato, it would appear that the PSS response of such electrodes is also clearly dependent on a non-equilibrium extraction process.\nOne immediate application of potentiometric polyion sensors is in the determination of heparin levels in whole blood samples from patients undergoing open heart surgery. Heparin is the most widely used anticoagulant in major surgical procedures and in extracorporeal procedures such as hemodialysis. Heparin doses given to patients during bypass surgery are typically in the range of 2\u20138 U/ml (0.4\u20131.6 \u03bcM). However, it is essential to monitor the anticoagulant effect of heparin during surgery, since higher doses of heparin are often associated with the risk of hemorrhage. Such heparin determinations can be readily performed via titrations with protamine . Protamine binds stoichiometrically, via electrostatic interactions with heparin. Since the polyion sensors respond only to free polyions (during the time course of a typical measurement) and not the complexed form, they can serve as convenient end-point detectors for such titrations. In early studies, blood heparin levels were determined with good accuracy via a pseudo-titration method using the TDMAC-based heparin sensitive electrode . A direct titration could not be employed in this case due to the irreversibility of the polyion electrode\u2019s response after exposure to a sample containing heparin. The pseudo-titrations were performed by adding small volumes (250 \u03bcl) of blood to a series of tubes containing known, increasing amounts of protamine. The potentiometric response of the polyanion-sensitive electrode was monitored upon sequentially switching the electrode from the tube containing the highest to the least amount of protamine. A decrease in potential was observed in those tubes where the heparin present in the blood was in excess of the protamine in that tube. The end-point of the titration was then determined by extrapolating the two linear regions of the titration curve.\nMore recently, DNNS-based cylindrical protamine sensitive electrodes (cylindrical to improve flux of polyion to surface and thereby lower detection limit) were used to perform direct titrations of heparin in buffered saline and blood, via addition of small aliquots of protamine to the heparinized sample . Consequently, the titrations are much simpler to perform when compared with the earlier pseudo-titrations using the polyanion-sensitive electrode. Fig. 8 A illustrates the typical potentiometric titration curves observed for varying heparin levels in a buffer solution, while Fig. 8B shows the results for the titration of a whole blood sample spiked with varying levels of heparin. Although the magitude of EMF response in blood is diminished compared to that in buffer, the end points of such titrations yield very good quantitative agreement with the levels of heparin present as determined by a commercial protamine titration method based on a clotting endpoint (non-electrochemical). This was demonstrated conclusively by Ramamurthy et al. who evaluated the performance of this simple titration method for quantitating the levels of heparin in the blood of patients undergoing heart by-pass surgery.\nPolyion-sensitive electrodes have also been proven to be a useful tool in the development of novel electrochemical enzyme assays. Indeed, Yun et al. first demonstrated the possibility of determining the activity of enzymes that cleave polyionic molecules into smaller fragments using an early polycation sensor based on tetraphenylborate . Since the EMF response of these electrodes is highly dependent on MW, cleavage of polyion substrates into smaller fragments leads to a reduced response toward the original polyion. In fact, Yun et al. showed that this approach could be used to detect trypsin, an enzyme that cleaves arginine rich peptides into smaller fragments . A reversal of the EMF response was recorded in real time after the enzyme was added to a protamine solution (see Fig. 9 for general protease assay with polycation sensor detection). The initial rate of potential decrease was shown to be proportional toward the trypsin activity. Further, it has been shown by Han et al. that synthetic polycationic peptides (rich in arginine) can be utilized to devise more selective substrates for given proteases (e.g. chymotrypsin and renin), and that the response of the DNNS-based membrane electrode toward these synthetic substrates is nearly as large as protamine. This approach is based upon incorporating a specific amino acid (or sequence of amino acids) cleavage site within a larger polycationic peptide structure, such that the action of the specific protease will selectively hydrolyze the larger peptide into smaller fragments toward which the membrane electrode exhibits far less potentiometric response (due to poor extraction compared to the initial larger polycationic substrate).\nThis general method of detecting enzyme activities is not limited to polycationic substrates. Indeed, Esson and Meyerhoff showed that a TDMAC-based polyanion sensor could be used in conjunction with polyphosphate and oligomer nucleotides as polyanionic substrates for the detection of acid phosphatase and RNase activities, respectively. Badr and Meyerhoff further expanded the application of polyion sensors by demonstrating their feasibility to monitor levels of trypsin-like protease inhibitors (\u03b11: antiproteinase inhibitor, \u03b12: macroglobulin, aprotinin and soybean inhibitor) . The hydrolysis of protamine upon the addition of proteinase-antiproteinase inhibitor test solutions was monitored in real-time using a DNNS-based polycation sensor. An effective assay for monitoring aprotinin (a plasmin inhibitor drug used to prevent post-operative bleeding in coronary bypass patients) levels in plasma samples using this approach was devised.\nPolyion sensitive membrane electrodes represent one new class of electrochemical devices that function via a non-equilibrium potentiometric response mechanism. This mechanism coupled with the favorable ion-pairing of polyions with lipophilic ion-exchangers in the membrane phases of such devices can limit there reuse of such sensors, and encourages employment of single-use disposable devices for most routine measurements (e.g. for potentiometric titrations, etc.). However, recent work by Mathison and Bakker have shown that it is possible to rapidly regenerate the surface layers of the polyion sensors by incorporating appropriate proton ionophores within the same sensing films, and equilibrating the sensor in a high pH buffer between sequential measurements with the same electrode. This is potentially a very attractive approach, and could further lead to even more diverse applications of these novel devices.\nPotentiometric sensors are traditionally ill-suited for the measurement of neutral species since changes in the charge separation at the sample-membrane interface are required for a potentiometric response. It is, however, well known that neutral species can be detected potentiometrically if they influence the spontaneous distribution of an electrically charged species. A classical, well documented example is the potentiometric response of solid-state heavy-metal ISEs to ligands, such as ammonia or cyanide. The complexation of the metal with these ligands changes their free concentration in the sample, which is detected potentiometrically.\nPolymeric membrane ISEs for neutral surfactants have been developed based on the same principle . The surfactant spontaneously extracts into the membrane phase that typically contains the barium salt of a tetraphenylborate derivative. Since the surfactant complexes cations in the membrane, it decreases the barium ion activity in the membrane and this gives rise to a large potentiometric response. Espadas-Torre et al. and Malinowska and Meyerhoff further studied how the presence of neutral surfactants (such as triton-X 100, Brij-20, etc.) affect the selectivity of neutral ionophore-based membranes for various cations. They found that the presence of such surfactants can dramatically decrease the selectivity of the membrane electrodes, owing to partitioning of surfactant into the membrane and a concomitant enhanced extraction of interferent cations as complexes with these polyether based surfactants.\nIto et al. have recently offered a well founded theoretical and experimental investigation on the unusual potentiometric response of ISE membranes to lipophilic phenols that may serve as a further basis for sensor development for electrically neutral analytes . In their system, polymeric membranes are doped with a lipophilic quaternary ammonium salt. It is observed that phenols are primarily extracted into the membrane in their neutral form. However, they can partially dissociate within the membrane phase to give the phenolate, ion paired by the quaternary ammonium cations. The resulting strong acid (H+ and the anion A\u2212 of the quaternary ammonium salt) is now expelled from the membrane. This results in a net charge transfer process that gives rise to a change in the membrane potential, with apparent super-Nernstian response slopes (see Fig. 10 ). As with the apparently twice-Nernstian response slopes (Section 2.4), such rather complex partitioning principles may, in fact, result in the design of new sensing principles.\nOne of the more unusual non-equilibrium potentiometric devices reported to date is a polymer membrane electrode that responds with apparent ion selectivity toward sulfite/bisulfite ions. As initially described by Pranitis and Meyerhoff , this membrane electrode is prepared by doping the neutral bis(diethyldithiocarbamato)mercury (II) complex (Hg(DTC)2 (see Fig. 11 ) within a typical plasticized PVC membrane. When assembled in a classical ISE arrangement, the electrode displays significant potentiometric response to sulfite ions (Fig. 11) with the slope highly dependent on the concentration of Hg(DTC)2 used to formulate the membrane. At concentrations >1 wt.%, response toward sulfite is typically near Nernstian (25\u201330 mV/decade) over the range of 10\u22126\u201310\u22123 M sulfite when tested in sample solutions consisting of a phosphate buffer, pH 10.0. However, when the pH of the test sample is buffered at pH. 6.0, much higher slopes to added sulfite are observed (50\u201355 mV/decade), presumably because of a concomitant potentiometric response toward bisulfite. Selectivity over a wide range of other anions, such as chloride, acetate, citrate, perchlorate, salicylate, nitrite and carbonate/bicarbonate is excellent (log K pot<\u22124). In contrast, significant responses to bromide, thiocyanide, and thiosulfate are observed, and exceptionally large interferences from sulfide and iodide prevent applications in the presence of these species .\nBased on these response characteristics, Pranitis and Meyerhoff originally postulated that the Hg(DTC)2 might be serving as a neutral carrier type ionophore within the PVC membranes, with sulfite binding either to a fifth coordination site on the Hg(II) ion, or more likely, sulfite replacing one the thiocarbonyl sulfur atoms that is originally coordinated to the Hg(II). Subsequent studies by Badr and Meyerhoff revealed a very different picture regarding the mechanism of potentiometric response. First, if the response was due to Hg(DTC)2 serving as a neutral carrier, addition of lipophilic cationic sites (e.g. quaternary ammonium salts) to the membrane should yield improved response and selectivity toward sulfite. However, response toward sulfite was actually degraded in the presence of added tridodecylmethylammonium ions suggesting an alternate mechanism.\nSeveral factors pointed toward a non-equilibrium reaction type response mechanism for the Hg(DTC)2\u2212-based sulfite electrode. First, it was found that the response slope toward sulfite actually decreased significantly when the electrode was in contact with sample solutions containing sulfite ions for extended time periods (e.g. 10 h). Since the Hg(DTC)2 complex is lipophilic, such loss in sulfite response could not be attributed to substantial leakage of the ionophore from the membrane. In addition, the degree of convective mixing in the sample solution was shown to affect the measured EMF value, with a significant increase in EMF (toward apparently less sulfite) as the stirring rate was decreased. This observation suggested that mass transport of sulfite to the membrane/sample interface plays a major role in the observed EMF response, analogous to observations made previously with non-equilibrium polyion sensors . Further, the response slope toward sulfite was shown to increase dramatically when the plasticizer content of the membrane was increased. Increasing plasticizer content greatly enhances the diffusion coefficient of the carrier in the membrane phase, and this observation further supported a non-equilibrium, steady-state response process.\nThe mechanism of the sulfite sensor was clarified further when it was found that the addition of a reducing agent, such as Sn(II) yielded anionic response, similar to that found for sulfite. Taken together, these observations suggested that the response to sulfite (as well as Sn(II), I\u2212, S2\u2212, and S2O4 2\u2212) of membranes doped with Hg(DTC)2 is due to a heterogeneous redox reaction at the membrane/sample interface. In the case of sulfite, it reacts with Hg(DTC)2 at the interface to form a Hg(I) complex with the DTC ligand, sulfate ion, and free negatively charged DTC ligands. This surface reaction scheme is illustrated in Fig. 12 . The production of negatively charged DTC ligands in the organic phase leads to a steady-state change in the phase boundary potential EMF value at the membrane sample interface, with the membrane becoming more negatively charged relative to the sample solution. With continued exposure to the reducing agent, sulfite, the membrane becomes depleted of the original Hg(DTC)2 complex, and the majority of the DTC is complexed with Hg(I); hence, little or no potentiometric response to added sulfite is observed after such prolonged exposure. However, with fresh membranes, the rate of sulfite mass transport to the surface of the membrane, coupled with the rate of Hg(DTC)2 complex diffusion within the membrane to the surface and loss of free anionic DTC ligand from the organic membrane (to the aqueous sample phase) will dictate the ultimate steady-state condition of charge separation at the membrane/sample interface due to the heterogeneous redox reaction.\nDespite the unusual non-equilibrium/redox reaction response mechanism, the sulfite sensors based on Hg(DTC)2 can be analytically useful. To enhance the practical selectivity of the device, the electrode was used as a down-stream potentiometric detector in flow-injection SO2 gas sensing system . Samples containing sulfite/bisulfite are injected into a sulfuric acid solution carrier stream, where proportional amounts of SO2 gas are generated. The gas then diffuses through a gas permeable membrane into a recipient solution (pH 5.0 or greater) where bisulfite/sulfite is formed from the diffusing gas. The Hg(DTC)2-based polymer membrane electrode then detects the bisulfite/sulfite in this recipient stream. The gas permeable membrane eliminates interferences from the other reducing agents that were shown to interfere greatly with the original membrane electrode. Such a flow-injection system was applied for measurement of sulfite/bisulfite level in various wine samples and results correlated quite well with a pararosaniline-based spectrophotometric method.\nOf course, as with any other non-equilibrium type potentiometric device, achieving reproducible analytical signals with the sulfite/bisulfite sensor based on polymer membranes doped with Hg(DTC)2 requires that mass transfer of the analyte species in the solution phase be carefully controlled from sample to sample. This is accomplished nicely in the FIA system via the controlled flow rate of recipient stream, and use of a tubular form of the polymer membrane electrode as an in-stream detector. Further, in the case of the sulfite/bisulfite sensor, one can expect a deterioration in the observed responses toward the analyte with time, as more and more of the original Hg(DTC)2 complex is reduced. Hence, frequent re-calibration of the system is mandatory, and replacement of the membrane electrode will be required after a finite number of test samples. Fortunately, when employed in an FIA mode, the contact time with the sulfite/bisulfite in the sample is relatively short; hence, it is likely that many hundreds of samples could be determined before significant degradation in the non-equilibrium/redox reaction EMF signal would be observed.\nIonophore-based polymeric membrane electrodes have now been in routine use for nearly 30 years. Hence, this research area may be viewed by many as a rather mature analytical technology. However, the recent developments in this field highlighted within this review clearly suggest a somewhat different picture. A new understanding of what factors control detection limits (ion fluxes) and measured selectivity of such devices, how EMF responses to non-charged and highly charged polyionic species can be observed, what conditions are required to obtain non-classical super-Nernstian responses, and the potentiometric detection of ions by redox reactions at ionophore-doped polymer membrane/sample interface rather than conventional ion-exchange are all new, exciting areas of basic research that have fundamental as well as practical analytical significance. Indeed, one only needs to read the recent literature cited herein to clearly see that what was thought to be impossible or improbable only a few years ago with respect to simple membrane electrode technology, is now quite feasible. Whether it be measuring ions at sub-nanomolar levels in environmental samples using ion gradients across appropriatly formulated membranes, or the detection of important biological polyions complex biological samples via non-equilibrium potentiometric measurements, there is certainly a vast new array of concepts and sensor design strategies that will continue to make ionophore-based membrane electrodes an attractive analytical methodology for research and applications into the next millennium."

Although these biosensors offer the possibility of on-line monitoring, with a specificity linked to that of the redox reactions catalysed by the immobilised enzyme, problems of interference arise from direct surface electrochemistry of electroactive species, such as ascorbate and urate, present in biological tissues and samples (). The most common class of enzyme used for biosensor fabrication are the oxidases (), many of which involve FAD-catalysed oxidation (reaction (1)) and the subsequent reduction of O2 to form H2O2 (reaction (2)) (), and the anodic detection of this enzyme-generated H2O2 has been the most widely used strategy for biosensor signal transduction (reaction (3)) (). The main problem with this approach is the high applied potential needed to oxidise H2O2 on most electrode materials, exacerbating electroactive interference, even at Pt where electrocatalytic reactions involving platinum oxides attenuate the overpotential significantly (). This problem has been minimised by the use of permselective membranes to block access by the interference to the electrode surface, and a widespread strategy has been the electrosynthesis of ultrathin polymers directly on the electrode surface, especially poly(1,2-diaminobenzene) (). substrate+EOx/FAD\u2192product+EOx/FADH2 EOx/FADH2+O2\u2192EOx/FAD+H2O2 H2O2\u2192O2+2H++2e\u2212 Alternatively, an electrochemical signal from the reduced oxidase can be obtained by using a redox mediator to replace O2 as the enzyme co-substrate. However, although these \u2018second generation\u2019 devices have the advantage of a lower operating potential and elimination of oxygen from the reaction scheme, they can suffer from a number of problems. These include leeching of mediator from the electrode surface or enzyme layer (), toxicity in biological tissues () and homogeneous interference, e.g. oxidised ferrocenes can be reduced by ascorbate (). Additionally, the complete insensitivity to oxygen tension sometimes claimed for this type of sensor has been questioned for certain mediators (). A recent form of these mediator-based biosensors involves Os-containing redox hydrogels (), in which the tethering of the redox couple overcomes many of the problems associated with freely-diffusing mediators. In this work, we investigate both strategies for the development of a glutamate biosensor suitable for incorporation into wells, that can be mass produced, for applications involving the release of glutamate from isolated cells. The importance of glutamate as a key target in bioanalytical applications is highlighted by the diverse studies on this amino acid, including cell perfusion media in vitro (), and in vivo detection in discrete brain regions using both biosensor () and microdialysis techniques ().\nA main issue addressed is the choice of electrode material for enzyme immobilisation and electrochemical detection. Pt is a good candidate because of its efficient interaction with H2O2, but electrodeposited layers can be mechanically unstable (). Pd, which has better electrodeposition characteristics (), also displays high activity towards H2O2 electro-oxidation, but much of this literature involves particulate forms of the metal embedded in carbon () and conducting polymers (). Thus, as a step towards fabricating well-based biosensors, basic issues such as usable potential range, suitability for electrosynthesis of permselective polymers, and comparative sensitivity to H2O2 and interference, were studied here on solid Pd electrodes and compared to Pt, Au and glassy carbon (GC).\nThe enzyme l-glutamate oxidase (GluOx from Streptomyces sp. X-119-6, EC 1.4.3.11, 200 U ml\u22121 in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was obtained as a generous gift from Yamasa Corp., Chiba, Japan and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C (). All chemicals, including 1,2-diaminobenzene (o-phenylenediamine, oPD, Sigma), l-glutamic acid (Glu, Sigma), l-ascorbic acid (Aldrich) and HRP redox polymer, including surfactant, from BAS, were used as supplied. Stock solutions of 100 mM Glu and H2O2 were prepared in doubly distilled water, and stored at 4 \u00b0C; 0.01 M HCl was used for the 100 mM ascorbate solution to inhibit aerial oxidation. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) consisted of 0.15 M NaCl (Merck, Poole, UK), 0.04 M NaH2PO4 (Merck) and 0.04 M NaOH (Merck). Solutions were kept refrigerated when not in use. 20 mM phosphate buffer (PB, 50 mM potassium perchlorate, pH 7.4) was used in all experiments involving HRP-modified electrodes.\nExperiments involving oPD-modified electrodes were done in a 25-ml glass cell at room temperature using a standard three-electrode set-up with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference and a stainless-steel needle as the auxiliary electrode. These experiments were microcomputer controlled with data acquisition achieved using a Biodata Microlink interface, a low-noise, low-damping potentiostat (Biostat II, Electrochemical and Medical Systems, Newbury, UK) and in-house software. Experiments involving HRP-modified electrodes were performed in a well of a 24-well polycarbonate plate at room temperature with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA, type E215) and a Pt wire counter electrode connected to a potentiostat (Ministat, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The linear and non-linear regression analyses were performed using the graphical software package Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data are reported as mean\u00b1S.D. in general, but S.E.M. values are used for slopes and other regression parameters.\nPt and Au macrodisks (M), 1.6 mm diameter, 2.0\u00d710\u22122 cm2 area from BAS, and Pd and GC macrodisks (3.0 mm diameter, 7.0\u00d710\u22122 cm2 area from BAS), were prepared by polishing with alumina (0.05 \u03bcm, BAS) and rinsing with distilled water. These four electrode substrates were used for the two distinct types of electrode investigated in this study: devices designed to detect H2O2 directly on the electrode surface, operating at high applied potentials and incorporating a permselective polymer (poly(o-phenylenediamine), PPD) electrosynthesised from oPD; and HRP/redox polymer modified electrodes that relied on enzyme-catalysed H2O2 detection at lower applied potentials. A SCE reference was used for the former, whereas a Ag/AgCl electrode (50 mV versus SCE) served as a reference for the latter type of biosensor. Amperometric electropolymerisation (700 mV versus SCE) onto the Pt, Au, Pd and GC electrodes was carried out potentiostatically using 300 mM oPD in PBS containing 5 mg/ml albumin (Alb), extracted from either chicken egg or bovine serum (Sigma). The presence of globular protein within the polymer (PPD) thus formed improves the compactness of the polymer matrix, providing increased permselectivity (). The enzyme GluOx was deposited by drop-evaporation (1 \u03bcl for Pt and Au, and 3.5 \u03bcl for Pd and GC\u2014scaled geometrically) for PPD-coated disks, using the undiluted 200 U/ml solution supplied. The GluOx thus deposited was trapped on the M/PPD disks by exposure to glutaraldehyde vapour for 10 min. These devices are termed M/PPD/GluOx electrodes, and were compared with literature data for PPD/GluOx-modified 5 T Pt wire cylinder electrodes (4.0\u00d710\u22123 cm2), Pt(5 T)/GluOx/PPD ().\nIn separate experiments, HRP redox polymer (Os2+-polyvinylpyridine) was deposited onto freshly cleaned working electrodes (Au, Pt, Pd and GC) as follows. Surfactant solution (1 \u03bcl) from the BAS kit was applied and allowed to dry at room temperature for 30 min. Then 1 \u03bcl of HRP redox polymer was dropped onto each electrode surface and allowed to dry at room temperature for 4 h. GluOx (1 \u03bcl) was then applied to the HRP-modified electrodes and allowed to dry overnight at 4 \u00b0C. These devices are termed M/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx electrodes and were compared with the M/PPD/GluOx electrodes described above.\nVoltammetric and amperometric experiments on PPD-modified electrodes were carried out in an electrochemical cell containing 20 ml of background electrolyte, PBS. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded between 0.0 and 0.8 V (versus SCE) at 20 mV/s in PBS before and after addition of analyte. Calibrations on these electrodes were carried out amperometrically at 700 mV, unless stated otherwise. These electrochemical measurements were recorded in quiescent solution. Aliquots of analyte (H2O2, Glu, ascorbate, etc.) were added using a 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe, and dispersed through the solution using a brief (ca. 5 s) period of pumped convection.\nAmperometric measurements on HRP-modified electrodes were performed in a polycarbonate well containing 2 ml of PB, using an operating potential of 100 mV versus the Ag/AgCl. After achieving a stable baseline current in the buffer, aliquots of either H2O2 or glutamate were added and current changes monitored. These measurements were carried out in stirred solutions.\nGold has a tendency to dissolve into solution at high anodic applied voltages, especially in basic solution (). However, potentials as high as +800 mV (versus SCE) have been employed at pH 7.0, albeit in buffered acetate electrolyte (). To investigate the potential-dependent behaviour of Au and Pd under conditions appropriate to later biological applications (buffered chloride solution, pH 7.4), and to compare with more common Pt and GC substrates, CV experiments were carried out scanning between 0 and 0.8 V (versus SCE) in PBS for the four electrode materials (Fig. 1 ). The behaviour of Pt and Pd were similar in having pronounced cathodic arms associated with the reduction of oxides on the surface of both metals (), although the current density scale was a factor of five smaller for Pd. Au displayed a classically capacitance shape up to a late upswing, presumably associated with Au dissolution (). The CV at GC consisted essentially of low capacitance currents. It appears, therefore, that +700 mV is the highest common applied potential that can be used safely for long-term amperometric experiments on all four electrodes in comparative studies.\nApparent double-layer capacitance values were calculated at a potential where the voltammetric currents were essentially horizontal for both the forward and backward sweeps (400 mV; see Fig. 1). The values (mF cm\u22122, n=5) were: 0.85\u00b10.05 (Pt); 0.28\u00b10.02 (Au); 0.19\u00b10.08 (Pd); and 0.040\u00b10.003 (GC).\nSince H2O2, the enzyme transduction molecule, is detected directly on the electrode surface in PPD/GluOx biosensors (reaction (3)), the potential dependence of H2O2 oxidation at the four electrode materials was investigated using CV (see Fig. 2 ). Following the pattern observed for CVs recorded in PBS only (Fig. 1), the voltammetric behaviour of H2O2 fell into two classes. At Pt and Pd, H2O2 oxidation occurred at relatively low applied potentials, consistent with electrocatalysis by surface oxides for both metals (); Au and GC displayed significantly higher overpotentials. In addition, there was a cathodic arm in the background-subtracted H2O2 CVs for Pt and Pd, absent for both Au and GC, which is due to the reduction of H2O2 (). To quantify the position of a voltammetric wave on the potential axis when a peak is not present, the potential at which the current rises most steeply (potential of maximum slope, E s,max) can be used (). The following values of E s,max were obtained (all \u00b15 mV, n=10): 155 mV (Pt); 770 mV (Au); 695 mV (Pd); and 770 mV (GC). The particular ability of Pt to facilitate the electro-oxidation of H2O2 is clear from its low E s,max value. The value for Pd was significantly higher, although less than that for Au and GC. The behaviour of H2O2 at Pd was complicated by the presence of two identifiable waves (Fig. 2, inset), the first (smaller) having an inflection point at \u223c300 mV. A clearer distinction between the H2O2 response at the four electrodes is provided by the slope of the wave (\u03bcA cm\u22122 mV\u22121 mM\u22121) at E s,max: 1.8\u00b10.2 (Pt); 0.62\u00b10.01 (Au); 1.2\u00b10.1 (Pd); and 0.044\u00b10.001 (GC). The ranking of H2O2 activity suggested by the trend in E s,max is re-enforced by this slope analysis: Pt>Pd>Au>GC. These results suggest that 700 mV is the optimum potential for efficient H2O2 detection in comparative amperometric experiments, viz. as high as possible for good H2O2 sensitivity and not too high for Au instability (see Fig. 1). However, voltammetric and amperometric behaviour might be different due to time-dependence of oxide states, etc. (). Therefore, this conclusion was tested in preliminary amperometric calibrations to compare H2O2 sensitivity at 600 and 700 mV for the four electrode types: the calibration slopes (nA cm\u22122 mM\u22121) for Pt and Pd were not very different at 600 mV (144\u00b12, Pt; 31\u00b11, Pd) and 700 mV (134\u00b16, Pt; 39\u00b15, Pd), GC was increased \u223c60% from 1.0\u00b10.1 to 1.6\u00b10.1, whereas H2O2 sensitivity increased 7-fold at Au from 5.5\u00b10.2 to 37\u00b12 nA cm\u22122 mM\u22121. This higher than expected sensitivity of Au maybe due to oxide states accumulated amperometrically at the higher potential (). Thus, 700 mV was chosen for all further amperometric studies; the enhanced sensitivity of Au, observed at the bare electrode, was maintained in H2O2 and glutamate calibrations at polymer-modified Au biosensors (see below).\nAdditional data on the relative electrochemical activities of the four materials was obtained by comparing CVs on potentially reversible (4-methylcatechol) and chemically irreversible (ascorbate) systems (Fig. 3 ). Ascorbate was also chosen as an important interference species in biosensor applications, and is chemically irreversible with an EC mechanism involving hydration (). 4-Methylcatechol was quasi-reversible on Pt and Au with a well-defined re-reduction peak in each case, but was irreversible on Pd and GC; ascorbate oxidation was irreversible on all four surfaces. Because ascorbate has the lowest redox potential of the species studied here (\u2212150 mV versus SCE under the present conditions (), it displayed efficient oxidation on Pt at low applied potentials, with an E s,max value of 25 mV. Thus, even at the low potentials used in mediator-based devices, ascorbate interference could be problematic unless a permselective membrane is included in the biosensor design. To compare the activities of H2O2, 4-methylcatechol and ascorbate on the four electrodes, the steepness of the respective oxidation waves were compared, using the maximum slope (\u03bcA cm\u22122 mV\u22121 mM\u22121) along the anodic sweep of the voltammogram (Fig. 3). This parameter is independent of the formal electrode potential of the redox couples and is a measure of relative electron-transfer kinetics (), if determined under the same conditions for couples with the same z-value, as was the case here. The overall picture presented by these data is that Pt showed the highest, and GC the lowest, activity towards all three analytes. The relative activities were mixed for Au and Pd.\nCVs of oPD (1,2-diaminobenzene) showed that the oxidation of this monomer was facile on the four electrode materials with low values of E s,max in all cases: Pt, 195 mV; Au, 235 mV; Pd, 265 mV; and GC, 250 mV (\u00b15 mV, first scan only due to passivisation). The electrodes were then re-polished and electropolymerisation carried out amperometrically at 700 mV over 20 min to achieve good permselective properties () because potential cycling has been shown to increase the permeability of electrosynthesised PPD to certain analytes ().\nAA calibrations carried out at 700 mV at the M/PPD electrodes showed that the AA blocking ability of the polymer/albumin composite layer was similar for the three metals (AA sensitivity in \u03bcA cm\u22122 mM\u22121): Pt, 0.5\u00b10.1; Au, 0.5\u00b10.1; and Pd, 0.35\u00b10.05. The particularly low AA sensitivity seen at the GC/PPD electrode (0.06\u00b10.01 \u03bcA cm\u22122 mM\u22121) was in part due to the poor AA oxidation on GC (see Fig. 3).\nGluOx was immobilised onto M/PPD electrodes by drop evaporation and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde vapour. To determine the efficiency of the four types of M/PPD/GluOx electrodes to detect H2O2 amperometrically, H2O2 calibrations were carried out at 700 mV versus SCE (Table 1 ). The trends in amperometric H2O2 sensitivity are consistent with the CV data in Fig. 3, except that Au was more sensitive amperometrically than voltammetrically, which may be due to a build up of electrocatalytic oxides at the constant high applied potential used in the amperometric experiments ().\nThe most important property of the M/PPD/GluOx sensors for applications in media containing low micromolar levels of glutamate is their sensitivity to glutamate at low concentrations. Table 1 gives the sensitivity slope up to 10 \u03bcM glutamate which shows that the trend is broadly in line with the H2O2 sensitivity. The low LOD for the metal-based biosensors (<0.5 \u03bcM) and good linearity suggest that this sensor design is appropriate for applications involving release of glutamate from isolated cells. Comparison of the linear sensitivity of Pt(M)/PPD/GluOx in the present studies (27\u00b13 nA cm\u22122 \u03bcM\u22121, n=4) with literature values for cylindrical wire Pt(5 T)/GluOx/PPD (28\u00b19 nA cm\u22122 \u03bcM\u22121, n=9) produced by dip evaporation of the enzyme solution (), shows that there was no difference in glutamate sensitivity in the linear range between these two methods of preparation.\nThe evolution of the biosensor parameters over four measurement days (three before a 13-day dry storage period, and one after) was determined. Only minor loss of sensitivity was observed over this period. For example, losses of 15\u00b16% in the linear H2O2 sensitivity and 23\u00b19% in the linear Glu response (n=4 electrodes) were observed for the 14-day period of dry storage and re-wetting.\nThe performance characteristics of M/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx biosensors were studied on the four electrode types for comparison. In order to investigate the electrochemical enzyme activity of HRP after the modification, sensitivities to peroxide were obtained using all four electrodes. Au and Pd showed much higher sensitivity to peroxide compared with the sensitivities for Pt and GC (Table 2 ). This is due to the lower stability of the redox polymer on the surface of Pt and GC. The manufacture\u2019s manual states that the use of the polymer is optimised only for Au. However, after GluOx modification, all three metal electrodes showed similar sensitivity to peroxide.\nFor glutamate, stable initial steady-state baselines in buffer were achieved in less than 10 min and steady-state current re-achieved in 30 s after addition of glutamate samples; Au (<5 s), Pd (<10 s), Pt (<20 s) and GC (<20 s). In Table 2, Au/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx electrodes show higher sensitivity (38\u00b18 nA \u03bcM\u22121 cm\u22122) than Pt/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx (24\u00b16 nA \u03bcM\u22121 cm\u22122, P<0.02). The results for the other electrodes are summarised in Table 2. For modified Pt electrodes, increasing the applied potential slightly improves its sensitivity (9% at 300 mV, 26% at 500 mV). However, the time taken to re-establish the steady-state response after addition of glutamate was significantly increased (more than 20 min), precluding these potentials in practical applications.\nOf the type 1 biosensors studied here, GC/PPD/GluOx appears too insensitive to Glu for applications in media of low glutamate concentration, with the highest LOD (\u223c2 \u03bcM). The three metals, however, showed sufficient sensitivity and stability for biosensor applications. Pt/PPD/GluOx was the most sensitive, but Pt might be difficult to electrodeposit in custom-designed cell media wells. Type 1 Au- and Pd-based biosensors showed similar behaviours, and a final choice might depend on other considerations, such as compatibility with other chemistries in the detection cell.\nWhen compared to type 2 (HRP) designs (see Fig. 4 ), only the Pt-based biosensors showed similar sensitivity to glutamate. However, although HRP-modified biosensors appear to outperform those based on the PPD design, the latter includes a permselective membrane making them suitable for applications in biological media containing high concentrations of ascorbate. Such a membrane would not be feasible for the HRP design because of the requirement for PVP-bound Os2+ to access the electrode.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "The incorporation of enzymes into electrode designs () has led to the development of amperometric sensors for biomolecules that are either non-electroactive, such as glutamate, or whose surface electrochemistry is too complex to allow direct reliable detection, such as glucose (). Although these biosensors offer the possibility of on-line monitoring, with a specificity linked to that of the redox reactions catalysed by the immobilised enzyme, problems of interference arise from direct surface electrochemistry of electroactive species, such as ascorbate and urate, present in biological tissues and samples (). The most common class of enzyme used for biosensor fabrication are the oxidases (), many of which involve FAD-catalysed oxidation (reaction (1)) and the subsequent reduction of O2 to form H2O2 (reaction (2)) (), and the anodic detection of this enzyme-generated H2O2 has been the most widely used strategy for biosensor signal transduction (reaction (3)) (). The main problem with this approach is the high applied potential needed to oxidise H2O2 on most electrode materials, exacerbating electroactive interference, even at Pt where electrocatalytic reactions involving platinum oxides attenuate the overpotential significantly (). This problem has been minimised by the use of permselective membranes to block access by the interference to the electrode surface, and a widespread strategy has been the electrosynthesis of ultrathin polymers directly on the electrode surface, especially poly(1,2-diaminobenzene) (). substrate+EOx/FAD\u2192product+EOx/FADH2 EOx/FADH2+O2\u2192EOx/FAD+H2O2 H2O2\u2192O2+2H++2e\u2212 Alternatively, an electrochemical signal from the reduced oxidase can be obtained by using a redox mediator to replace O2 as the enzyme co-substrate. However, although these \u2018second generation\u2019 devices have the advantage of a lower operating potential and elimination of oxygen from the reaction scheme, they can suffer from a number of problems. These include leeching of mediator from the electrode surface or enzyme layer (), toxicity in biological tissues () and homogeneous interference, e.g. oxidised ferrocenes can be reduced by ascorbate (). Additionally, the complete insensitivity to oxygen tension sometimes claimed for this type of sensor has been questioned for certain mediators (). A recent form of these mediator-based biosensors involves Os-containing redox hydrogels (), in which the tethering of the redox couple overcomes many of the problems associated with freely-diffusing mediators. In this work, we investigate both strategies for the development of a glutamate biosensor suitable for incorporation into wells, that can be mass produced, for applications involving the release of glutamate from isolated cells. The importance of glutamate as a key target in bioanalytical applications is highlighted by the diverse studies on this amino acid, including cell perfusion media in vitro (), and in vivo detection in discrete brain regions using both biosensor () and microdialysis techniques ().\nA main issue addressed is the choice of electrode material for enzyme immobilisation and electrochemical detection. Pt is a good candidate because of its efficient interaction with H2O2, but electrodeposited layers can be mechanically unstable (). Pd, which has better electrodeposition characteristics (), also displays high activity towards H2O2 electro-oxidation, but much of this literature involves particulate forms of the metal embedded in carbon () and conducting polymers (). Thus, as a step towards fabricating well-based biosensors, basic issues such as usable potential range, suitability for electrosynthesis of permselective polymers, and comparative sensitivity to H2O2 and interference, were studied here on solid Pd electrodes and compared to Pt, Au and glassy carbon (GC).\nThe enzyme l-glutamate oxidase (GluOx from Streptomyces sp. X-119-6, EC 1.4.3.11, 200 U ml\u22121 in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was obtained as a generous gift from Yamasa Corp., Chiba, Japan and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C (). All chemicals, including 1,2-diaminobenzene (o-phenylenediamine, oPD, Sigma), l-glutamic acid (Glu, Sigma), l-ascorbic acid (Aldrich) and HRP redox polymer, including surfactant, from BAS, were used as supplied. Stock solutions of 100 mM Glu and H2O2 were prepared in doubly distilled water, and stored at 4 \u00b0C; 0.01 M HCl was used for the 100 mM ascorbate solution to inhibit aerial oxidation. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) consisted of 0.15 M NaCl (Merck, Poole, UK), 0.04 M NaH2PO4 (Merck) and 0.04 M NaOH (Merck). Solutions were kept refrigerated when not in use. 20 mM phosphate buffer (PB, 50 mM potassium perchlorate, pH 7.4) was used in all experiments involving HRP-modified electrodes.\nExperiments involving oPD-modified electrodes were done in a 25-ml glass cell at room temperature using a standard three-electrode set-up with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference and a stainless-steel needle as the auxiliary electrode. These experiments were microcomputer controlled with data acquisition achieved using a Biodata Microlink interface, a low-noise, low-damping potentiostat (Biostat II, Electrochemical and Medical Systems, Newbury, UK) and in-house software. Experiments involving HRP-modified electrodes were performed in a well of a 24-well polycarbonate plate at room temperature with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA, type E215) and a Pt wire counter electrode connected to a potentiostat (Ministat, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The linear and non-linear regression analyses were performed using the graphical software package Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data are reported as mean\u00b1S.D. in general, but S.E.M. values are used for slopes and other regression parameters.\nPt and Au macrodisks (M), 1.6 mm diameter, 2.0\u00d710\u22122 cm2 area from BAS, and Pd and GC macrodisks (3.0 mm diameter, 7.0\u00d710\u22122 cm2 area from BAS), were prepared by polishing with alumina (0.05 \u03bcm, BAS) and rinsing with distilled water. These four electrode substrates were used for the two distinct types of electrode investigated in this study: devices designed to detect H2O2 directly on the electrode surface, operating at high applied potentials and incorporating a permselective polymer (poly(o-phenylenediamine), PPD) electrosynthesised from oPD; and HRP/redox polymer modified electrodes that relied on enzyme-catalysed H2O2 detection at lower applied potentials. A SCE reference was used for the former, whereas a Ag/AgCl electrode (50 mV versus SCE) served as a reference for the latter type of biosensor. Amperometric electropolymerisation (700 mV versus SCE) onto the Pt, Au, Pd and GC electrodes was carried out potentiostatically using 300 mM oPD in PBS containing 5 mg/ml albumin (Alb), extracted from either chicken egg or bovine serum (Sigma). The presence of globular protein within the polymer (PPD) thus formed improves the compactness of the polymer matrix, providing increased permselectivity (). The enzyme GluOx was deposited by drop-evaporation (1 \u03bcl for Pt and Au, and 3.5 \u03bcl for Pd and GC\u2014scaled geometrically) for PPD-coated disks, using the undiluted 200 U/ml solution supplied. The GluOx thus deposited was trapped on the M/PPD disks by exposure to glutaraldehyde vapour for 10 min. These devices are termed M/PPD/GluOx electrodes, and were compared with literature data for PPD/GluOx-modified 5 T Pt wire cylinder electrodes (4.0\u00d710\u22123 cm2), Pt(5 T)/GluOx/PPD ().\nIn separate experiments, HRP redox polymer (Os2+-polyvinylpyridine) was deposited onto freshly cleaned working electrodes (Au, Pt, Pd and GC) as follows. Surfactant solution (1 \u03bcl) from the BAS kit was applied and allowed to dry at room temperature for 30 min. Then 1 \u03bcl of HRP redox polymer was dropped onto each electrode surface and allowed to dry at room temperature for 4 h. GluOx (1 \u03bcl) was then applied to the HRP-modified electrodes and allowed to dry overnight at 4 \u00b0C. These devices are termed M/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx electrodes and were compared with the M/PPD/GluOx electrodes described above.\nVoltammetric and amperometric experiments on PPD-modified electrodes were carried out in an electrochemical cell containing 20 ml of background electrolyte, PBS. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded between 0.0 and 0.8 V (versus SCE) at 20 mV/s in PBS before and after addition of analyte. Calibrations on these electrodes were carried out amperometrically at 700 mV, unless stated otherwise. These electrochemical measurements were recorded in quiescent solution. Aliquots of analyte (H2O2, Glu, ascorbate, etc.) were added using a 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe, and dispersed through the solution using a brief (ca. 5 s) period of pumped convection.\nAmperometric measurements on HRP-modified electrodes were performed in a polycarbonate well containing 2 ml of PB, using an operating potential of 100 mV versus the Ag/AgCl. After achieving a stable baseline current in the buffer, aliquots of either H2O2 or glutamate were added and current changes monitored. These measurements were carried out in stirred solutions.\nGold has a tendency to dissolve into solution at high anodic applied voltages, especially in basic solution (). However, potentials as high as +800 mV (versus SCE) have been employed at pH 7.0, albeit in buffered acetate electrolyte (). To investigate the potential-dependent behaviour of Au and Pd under conditions appropriate to later biological applications (buffered chloride solution, pH 7.4), and to compare with more common Pt and GC substrates, CV experiments were carried out scanning between 0 and 0.8 V (versus SCE) in PBS for the four electrode materials (Fig. 1 ). The behaviour of Pt and Pd were similar in having pronounced cathodic arms associated with the reduction of oxides on the surface of both metals (), although the current density scale was a factor of five smaller for Pd. Au displayed a classically capacitance shape up to a late upswing, presumably associated with Au dissolution (). The CV at GC consisted essentially of low capacitance currents. It appears, therefore, that +700 mV is the highest common applied potential that can be used safely for long-term amperometric experiments on all four electrodes in comparative studies.\nApparent double-layer capacitance values were calculated at a potential where the voltammetric currents were essentially horizontal for both the forward and backward sweeps (400 mV; see Fig. 1). The values (mF cm\u22122, n=5) were: 0.85\u00b10.05 (Pt); 0.28\u00b10.02 (Au); 0.19\u00b10.08 (Pd); and 0.040\u00b10.003 (GC).\nSince H2O2, the enzyme transduction molecule, is detected directly on the electrode surface in PPD/GluOx biosensors (reaction (3)), the potential dependence of H2O2 oxidation at the four electrode materials was investigated using CV (see Fig. 2 ). Following the pattern observed for CVs recorded in PBS only (Fig. 1), the voltammetric behaviour of H2O2 fell into two classes. At Pt and Pd, H2O2 oxidation occurred at relatively low applied potentials, consistent with electrocatalysis by surface oxides for both metals (); Au and GC displayed significantly higher overpotentials. In addition, there was a cathodic arm in the background-subtracted H2O2 CVs for Pt and Pd, absent for both Au and GC, which is due to the reduction of H2O2 (). To quantify the position of a voltammetric wave on the potential axis when a peak is not present, the potential at which the current rises most steeply (potential of maximum slope, E s,max) can be used (). The following values of E s,max were obtained (all \u00b15 mV, n=10): 155 mV (Pt); 770 mV (Au); 695 mV (Pd); and 770 mV (GC). The particular ability of Pt to facilitate the electro-oxidation of H2O2 is clear from its low E s,max value. The value for Pd was significantly higher, although less than that for Au and GC. The behaviour of H2O2 at Pd was complicated by the presence of two identifiable waves (Fig. 2, inset), the first (smaller) having an inflection point at \u223c300 mV. A clearer distinction between the H2O2 response at the four electrodes is provided by the slope of the wave (\u03bcA cm\u22122 mV\u22121 mM\u22121) at E s,max: 1.8\u00b10.2 (Pt); 0.62\u00b10.01 (Au); 1.2\u00b10.1 (Pd); and 0.044\u00b10.001 (GC). The ranking of H2O2 activity suggested by the trend in E s,max is re-enforced by this slope analysis: Pt>Pd>Au>GC. These results suggest that 700 mV is the optimum potential for efficient H2O2 detection in comparative amperometric experiments, viz. as high as possible for good H2O2 sensitivity and not too high for Au instability (see Fig. 1). However, voltammetric and amperometric behaviour might be different due to time-dependence of oxide states, etc. (). Therefore, this conclusion was tested in preliminary amperometric calibrations to compare H2O2 sensitivity at 600 and 700 mV for the four electrode types: the calibration slopes (nA cm\u22122 mM\u22121) for Pt and Pd were not very different at 600 mV (144\u00b12, Pt; 31\u00b11, Pd) and 700 mV (134\u00b16, Pt; 39\u00b15, Pd), GC was increased \u223c60% from 1.0\u00b10.1 to 1.6\u00b10.1, whereas H2O2 sensitivity increased 7-fold at Au from 5.5\u00b10.2 to 37\u00b12 nA cm\u22122 mM\u22121. This higher than expected sensitivity of Au maybe due to oxide states accumulated amperometrically at the higher potential (). Thus, 700 mV was chosen for all further amperometric studies; the enhanced sensitivity of Au, observed at the bare electrode, was maintained in H2O2 and glutamate calibrations at polymer-modified Au biosensors (see below).\nAdditional data on the relative electrochemical activities of the four materials was obtained by comparing CVs on potentially reversible (4-methylcatechol) and chemically irreversible (ascorbate) systems (Fig. 3 ). Ascorbate was also chosen as an important interference species in biosensor applications, and is chemically irreversible with an EC mechanism involving hydration (). 4-Methylcatechol was quasi-reversible on Pt and Au with a well-defined re-reduction peak in each case, but was irreversible on Pd and GC; ascorbate oxidation was irreversible on all four surfaces. Because ascorbate has the lowest redox potential of the species studied here (\u2212150 mV versus SCE under the present conditions (), it displayed efficient oxidation on Pt at low applied potentials, with an E s,max value of 25 mV. Thus, even at the low potentials used in mediator-based devices, ascorbate interference could be problematic unless a permselective membrane is included in the biosensor design. To compare the activities of H2O2, 4-methylcatechol and ascorbate on the four electrodes, the steepness of the respective oxidation waves were compared, using the maximum slope (\u03bcA cm\u22122 mV\u22121 mM\u22121) along the anodic sweep of the voltammogram (Fig. 3). This parameter is independent of the formal electrode potential of the redox couples and is a measure of relative electron-transfer kinetics (), if determined under the same conditions for couples with the same z-value, as was the case here. The overall picture presented by these data is that Pt showed the highest, and GC the lowest, activity towards all three analytes. The relative activities were mixed for Au and Pd.\nCVs of oPD (1,2-diaminobenzene) showed that the oxidation of this monomer was facile on the four electrode materials with low values of E s,max in all cases: Pt, 195 mV; Au, 235 mV; Pd, 265 mV; and GC, 250 mV (\u00b15 mV, first scan only due to passivisation). The electrodes were then re-polished and electropolymerisation carried out amperometrically at 700 mV over 20 min to achieve good permselective properties () because potential cycling has been shown to increase the permeability of electrosynthesised PPD to certain analytes ().\nAA calibrations carried out at 700 mV at the M/PPD electrodes showed that the AA blocking ability of the polymer/albumin composite layer was similar for the three metals (AA sensitivity in \u03bcA cm\u22122 mM\u22121): Pt, 0.5\u00b10.1; Au, 0.5\u00b10.1; and Pd, 0.35\u00b10.05. The particularly low AA sensitivity seen at the GC/PPD electrode (0.06\u00b10.01 \u03bcA cm\u22122 mM\u22121) was in part due to the poor AA oxidation on GC (see Fig. 3).\nGluOx was immobilised onto M/PPD electrodes by drop evaporation and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde vapour. To determine the efficiency of the four types of M/PPD/GluOx electrodes to detect H2O2 amperometrically, H2O2 calibrations were carried out at 700 mV versus SCE (Table 1 ). The trends in amperometric H2O2 sensitivity are consistent with the CV data in Fig. 3, except that Au was more sensitive amperometrically than voltammetrically, which may be due to a build up of electrocatalytic oxides at the constant high applied potential used in the amperometric experiments ().\nThe most important property of the M/PPD/GluOx sensors for applications in media containing low micromolar levels of glutamate is their sensitivity to glutamate at low concentrations. Table 1 gives the sensitivity slope up to 10 \u03bcM glutamate which shows that the trend is broadly in line with the H2O2 sensitivity. The low LOD for the metal-based biosensors (<0.5 \u03bcM) and good linearity suggest that this sensor design is appropriate for applications involving release of glutamate from isolated cells. Comparison of the linear sensitivity of Pt(M)/PPD/GluOx in the present studies (27\u00b13 nA cm\u22122 \u03bcM\u22121, n=4) with literature values for cylindrical wire Pt(5 T)/GluOx/PPD (28\u00b19 nA cm\u22122 \u03bcM\u22121, n=9) produced by dip evaporation of the enzyme solution (), shows that there was no difference in glutamate sensitivity in the linear range between these two methods of preparation.\nThe evolution of the biosensor parameters over four measurement days (three before a 13-day dry storage period, and one after) was determined. Only minor loss of sensitivity was observed over this period. For example, losses of 15\u00b16% in the linear H2O2 sensitivity and 23\u00b19% in the linear Glu response (n=4 electrodes) were observed for the 14-day period of dry storage and re-wetting.\nThe performance characteristics of M/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx biosensors were studied on the four electrode types for comparison. In order to investigate the electrochemical enzyme activity of HRP after the modification, sensitivities to peroxide were obtained using all four electrodes. Au and Pd showed much higher sensitivity to peroxide compared with the sensitivities for Pt and GC (Table 2 ). This is due to the lower stability of the redox polymer on the surface of Pt and GC. The manufacture\u2019s manual states that the use of the polymer is optimised only for Au. However, after GluOx modification, all three metal electrodes showed similar sensitivity to peroxide.\nFor glutamate, stable initial steady-state baselines in buffer were achieved in less than 10 min and steady-state current re-achieved in 30 s after addition of glutamate samples; Au (<5 s), Pd (<10 s), Pt (<20 s) and GC (<20 s). In Table 2, Au/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx electrodes show higher sensitivity (38\u00b18 nA \u03bcM\u22121 cm\u22122) than Pt/Os2+PVP/HRP/GluOx (24\u00b16 nA \u03bcM\u22121 cm\u22122, P<0.02). The results for the other electrodes are summarised in Table 2. For modified Pt electrodes, increasing the applied potential slightly improves its sensitivity (9% at 300 mV, 26% at 500 mV). However, the time taken to re-establish the steady-state response after addition of glutamate was significantly increased (more than 20 min), precluding these potentials in practical applications.\nOf the type 1 biosensors studied here, GC/PPD/GluOx appears too insensitive to Glu for applications in media of low glutamate concentration, with the highest LOD (\u223c2 \u03bcM). The three metals, however, showed sufficient sensitivity and stability for biosensor applications. Pt/PPD/GluOx was the most sensitive, but Pt might be difficult to electrodeposit in custom-designed cell media wells. Type 1 Au- and Pd-based biosensors showed similar behaviours, and a final choice might depend on other considerations, such as compatibility with other chemistries in the detection cell.\nWhen compared to type 2 (HRP) designs (see Fig. 4 ), only the Pt-based biosensors showed similar sensitivity to glutamate. However, although HRP-modified biosensors appear to outperform those based on the PPD design, the latter includes a permselective membrane making them suitable for applications in biological media containing high concentrations of ascorbate. Such a membrane would not be feasible for the HRP design because of the requirement for PVP-bound Os2+ to access the electrode."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nMicro-total analysis systems (\u03bc-TAS) have been brought closer to operational realisation as several technologies have advanced the ability to manipulate sub-micro litre aliquots of biochemical material. Electro-osmotic and electrophoretic forces that can move cells and conductive solvents along glass- and semiconductor-etched capillaries have advanced continuous-flow technologies such as capillary electrophoresis where DC electric fields, selectively applied along branched channels, can yield valve-less routing of cell suspensions and reagents. Progressively sophisticated designs for such devices have been developed, now encompassing three-dimensional channel structures capable of routing and combining suspensions of biological interest in a multitude of ways. In continuous-flow systems channels are used to direct reagent and analyte flow, and to limit lateral diffusion of analytes. Although increasing structural complexity permits a corresponding increase in sophistication of processes, tubes and channels inherently represent a \u201chard-wired\u201d architecture that can exercise only the specific class or sequence of reactions that their physical structures are designed to realise. Drawbacks to continuous-flow \u03bc-TAS systems have been pointed out previously, and include: (1) the possibility of unintended electrochemistry from exposed electrodes interfering with desired processes, (2) the need for micro-pumps or valves, which currently are mechanically complex and have low mean times between failure, (3) dead volumes that can be made small, but not negligible, by making channel dimensions small, and (4) continuity which limits flow control and mandates that flow from one branched channel affects all other channels, unless micro-valves are employed.\nA recent approach to making \u03bcTAS devices that overcomes these continuous flow limitations and allows for the possibility of programmable operation is the use of reaction surfaces whereby samples and reagents in the form of droplets may be combined in different manners according to an arbitrary algorithm. Such an approach demands not only a suitable reaction surface on which droplet chemistry is performed, but also a motive force for the injection and manipulation of the droplets. Electric field-based forces are ideally suited to such droplet manipulations on the microscale. These forces fall into three distinct classes, namely electrophoretic, electrowetting and dielectrophoretic. The first of these depends on the application of large DC fields that are problematical in systems involving conductive suspensions. However, the latter two forces depend on the square of the field strength, allowing AC fields to be used. Fair and Kim have successfully explored the use of electrowetting as the means for creating droplet processors. However, translational electrowetting forces depend sensitively on the difference in wetting between the leading and trailing edge of droplets and it is likely that surface contamination issues may arise in many real world biological analysis problems under these conditions. Additionally, the range of sizes of droplets that can be conveniently injected by this approach is limited by the need to confine the droplets between the top and bottom walls of the manipulation chamber. By careful design of electric field geometries and the use of non-wetting surfaces, dielectrophoretic forces, which act as body forces on the droplet rather than surface forces, can be made to dominate. Batchelder first proposed this method as the basis of a droplet processor, and he and others have demonstrated droplet movement based on dielectrophoresis. Here we present a more complete droplet processor based on dielectrophoresis in which we solve not only the problem of droplet translation on a two-dimensional non-wetting reaction surface, but also the problem of the injection of droplets over a range of scales that allows for the control of reagent titrations.\nDielectric forces do not depend on the movement of charge, but on the polarisability of particles (cells, droplets) relative to their surroundings. By exploiting these properties we have used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to manipulate collections of cells whose interiors may be made dielectrically distinct from a low-conductivity suspending medium. This also permits the manipulation of any type of liquid droplet within a dielectrically distinct immiscible carrier medium enabling the discreteness of droplet-based microchemistry. Secondly, dielectric forces are generated by spatially inhomogeneous electric fields. Hence, DEP requires no mechanical actuation. Thirdly, packaging analytes and reagents into discrete droplets, which also permit accurate quantification of reagents, can obviate dead volumes and continuity issues. This has advantages in that liquid droplets not amenable to triboelectrification may be manipulated, and that since electric fields need not penetrate droplets there need be no energy deposition into or temperature rise within the droplets. Finally, packaging reagents and analytes in discrete droplets remove the need for channels in order to transport materials of interest. Droplets may be manipulated arbitrarily and combined on a two-dimensional \u201creaction surface\u201d. In this paper, we use dielectrophoresis to exert translational forces on uncharged aqueous droplets as a way to manipulate reagent- and analyte-bearing droplets along arbitrary pathways on a two-dimensional reaction surface as well as a way to introduce droplets onto the reaction surface using a no-moving-parts dielectrophoretic injection mechanism. This, in turn, leads to a programmable, and software-reconfigurable \u03bc-TAS. We will describe the principles behind these new methods and illustrate them by demonstrating a simple example of droplet-based microchemistry.\nPFP fabrication: We formed programmable fluidic processor (PFP) reaction spaces by patterning a two-dimensional array of electrodes using standard photolithographic techniques on glass substrates, electrically passivating the electrodes, forming an open fluidic reservoir, adhering a hydrophobic coating, and connecting the resulting device to a computer-controlled switching circuit.\nConventional negative-mask photolithography was employed to fabricate electrodes from glass substrates on which a titanium adhesion layer (25 nm) and gold conduction layer (250 nm) had been vacuum deposited. Initial arrays consisted of eight-by-eight square electrodes, 30, 100, and 300 \u00b5m on a side with each electrode individually connected to a solder pad along two opposite edges of the substrate. A thin (\u223c0.5 \u00b5m) passivation layer, either vacuum-deposited Parylene, or spin-coated amorphous Teflon AF\u00ae was applied to the patterned electrode surface to prevent current flow across, and electro-chemistry on, the reaction surface. Although, PFPs will be fully sealed for clinical use, we used an open-face arrangement for laboratory experiments. A nitrile o-ring was secured to the substrate around the reaction surface's active region to form a reservoir for the suspending medium. Finally, since neither Parylene nor Teflon AF\u00ae were sufficiently hydrophobic, we applied a coating of Fluoro-Pel\u00ae (Cytonix Corporation, Beltsville, MD), to provide a non-conductive, optically transparent, and non-fluorescent surface. The finished electrode array is shown in Fig. 1. In operation, the reservoir was filled with 1-bromododecane, a low-permittivity (\u03b5 = 4.1), low-viscosity (\u03b7 = 3.6 cSt), water-immiscible, hydrocarbon.\nIndividual electrodes on the reaction surface were energized with AC signals up to 180 Vp-p, and frequencies between 5 and 500 kHz generated by a programmable function generator (DS345, Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA) and amplified by variable gain AC amplifiers (model 7500, Krohn-Hite Corp., Avon, MA). The AC signal was distributed to an array of solid-state switches (HV209, Supertex Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) operating under a microcontroller (BASIC stamp, Parallax Inc., Rocklin, CA) that executed a custom VisualBASIC\u00ae program from a laptop computer. Electrodes to be activated were manually selected by checking their graphical representations on the laptop screen. The sequence of activated electrodes was stored as a script, which the driver program would execute at a user-selectable rate.\nThe experimental apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2 was built around an upright microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) mounting a motorized 3-axis platform controllable via either a joystick or computer interface (Ludl Electronic Products, Ltd., Hawthorne, NY). A chilled, 3-chip, colour CCD camera (Hamamatsu model C-5810) was mounted to the microscope and connected to a video frame counter (VC-81, For-A Company, Ltd.) used to label the recorded video sequences, and a videocassette recorder (AG-7350, Panasonic) used to record the experiments. The microscope was equipped with a trans-illuminating quartz-halogen lamp for most viewing applications and a xenon lamp for fluorescence studies. Two fluorescence filter sets (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) were used: (1) Texas Red, excitation = 535\u2013585 nm, emission = 605\u2013680 nm for viewing experiments using Fluorescein; and (2) DAPI, excitation = 360 nm, emission = 440\u2013490 nm for viewing experiments using o-phthalaldehyde.\nIn addition to moving droplets from point-to-point, DEP was used to form droplets at pressurised orifices near electrodes. Hydrostatic pressure, and the interfacial tension between the aqueous/hydrocarbon surface act to \u201chold off\u201d fluid flow from the orifice. This holdoff effect was utilised as a controllable check-valve to prevent spontaneous fluid flow. A DEP field applied near the orifice was used to form aqueous droplets within the less polarisable carrier fluid and inject them onto the reaction surface. A DEP force acting to overcome hydrostatic holdoff enables \u201cno-moving-parts\u201d valving, pumping, and metering of droplets that can then be manipulated. To this end, a fluid handling system consisting of a manual syringe pump, in-line pressure sensor, and micro-pipettes mounted to five-axis Huxley-Wahl micromanipulators (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to position fluid injectors on the reaction surface.\nAqueous droplets 20\u2013500 \u00b5m in diameter were manoeuvred in two-dimensions across 8 \u00d7 8 two-dimensional electrode arrays using DEP forces. The movement of the droplets was controlled by switching a series of electrodes on and off in sequence. Energising an electrode adjacent to a droplet moved the local field energy minimum to that electrode, exerting a lateral force on the droplet in the direction of the new field minimum. The sequence was controlled from a custom, laptop computer-based graphical user interface. The high-permittivity droplet tended to move toward the adjacent electrode where the field lines converged and the E-field gradient was greatest due to the electrode geometry. Fig. 3 shows five frames from a videotape sequence in which a 0.18 nl and two 0.065 nl droplets are manoeuvred across an 8 \u00d7 8 array (30 \u00b5m electrodes) and sequentially combined with a 0.38 nl droplet. Fusion of individual droplets occurred spontaneously when they were brought into close proximity to each other. Fig. 3e shows the resulting 0.69 nl droplet, containing all of the original fluid volume, which has been manoeuvred to the edge of the array. A detailed discussion of droplet movement rate is beyond the scope of this paper, but is a function of the applied electric field, the diameter of the droplet relative to the electrode size, and the Stokes drag on the droplet. The droplets in Fig. 3 traversed the 60 \u00b5m inter-electrode distance in less than 1 video frame (1/30 s), yielding a speed of >1.8 mm s\u22121.\nAs demonstrated for the first time, in this study DEP was used to create a no-moving-parts mechanism for injecting discrete aliquots of fluid onto a reaction surface. Micropipette injectors, filled with de-gassed, triply-distilled water (3 \u00d7 H2O), were immersed in the suspending fluid reservoir and manoeuvred adjacent to an electrode of the array. Injector height above the reaction surface was kept to 10\u201320 \u00b5m. The amplitude and frequency of the DEP voltage, VDEP and fDEP respectively, were controlled from the external DC power supply and function generator. The lateral distance from the injector orifice to the edge of the electrode, Z, was controlled by the Huxley-Wahl micromanipulator. A syringe pump was used to control the pressure, P, of the droplet fluid in the fluid handling system, which was monitored by a custom-built pressure sensor/amplifier. Each droplet injection sequence was videotaped, with each set of operational parameters referenced against a frame counter that recorded the experiment sequence number. Lateral distances and droplet diameters were determined from analysis of digitised videotape images for which the square electrodes provided an accurate metric.\nDroplet injection was initiated by energising the electrode nearest the injector, creating a DEP force on the fluid within the injector directed toward the edges of the energised electrode. Given an appropriate balance of applied VDEP, injector pressure and injector-electrode geometry, fluid would be drawn out of the injector, form a discrete droplet, then separate from the injector and move onto the energised electrode. A balance of forces produced by the applied DEP field drawing fluid from the injector at a given rate and the interfacial tension between the droplet and suspending fluids consistently yielded injected droplets of a uniform size. Fig. 4 shows an 18 \u00b5m diameter (3 pl) droplet in the process of being metered into an existing 42 \u00b5m diameter (39 pl) droplet which is situated on the energised electrode.\nFig. 5 shows two frames of videotape sequence that illustrates the spontaneous fusion of two droplets with passive diffusion and mixing of their contents. Frame (a) shows the two aqueous droplets suspended in liquid hydrocarbon situated on an array composed of individually addressable electrodes 30 \u00b5m on a side separated by 30 \u00b5m open spaces. The droplets were fused by activating intervening electrodes in order to bring them into close proximity where the droplets fused spontaneously as a result of the lower energy/higher entropy configuration afforded by a single large droplet (cf. frame (b)). The spontaneous fusing of discrete droplets lead not only to content mixing in strict stoichiometry of the fusing droplets, but in rapid diffusion of droplet contents as a result of the inward momentum generated by their fusion. From the video frame rate and transverse scale provided by the 30 \u00b5m electrodes it was deduced that the diffusion front moved across the fused droplet in Fig. 5 at \u223c170 \u00b5m s\u22121.\nA fluorescence-based protein determination was performed to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the use of the PFP to execute a droplet-based biochemical analysis. Fig. 6 is an enhanced image of a set of nine droplets distributed on an 8 \u00d7 8 electrode PFP. The droplets were formed using DEP injection to lay down droplets of o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) (Pierce, Rockford, Il) approximately 500 \u00b5m in diameter (65 nl) from a pipette manoeuvred into close proximity to the individually addressable electrodes. Varying amounts of a 0.5 mg ml\u22121 solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) (MW = 68 kD) were then metered into the OPA droplets from a second injector. Individual DEP-injected BSA droplets averaged \u223c70 \u00b5m in diameter yielding repeatable aliquots of 0.18 nl. The resulting fused droplets contained protein concentrations that spanned three decades from 0.266\u2013232 \u00b5g ml\u22121. One droplet, containing no added protein, served as a control for determining background fluorescence. Uniform illumination of the view field with a mercury source produced blue fluorescence by the protein-bound OPA which was observed through a DAPI filter set by a colour CCD camera with a controllable integration time. Digital images recorded with different integration times were compared to quantify the wide range of fluorescence observed.\nOur work is based on understanding that a freely suspended dielectric object will move in such a way as to minimise applied electric field energy. For our purposes here it is sufficient to note that an uncharged, polarisable object in a spatially inhomogeneous electric field is attracted to a region of high electric field gradient (\u2207E) if its polarisability is greater than that of its surroundings.\nThe real part of the time-averaged DEP force \u3008F(t)\u3009 acting on a particle due to an imposed electrical field, E(\u03c9), can be approximated in terms of dipole effects by\nwhere \u03b5m is the permittivity of the suspending medium, r is the radius of the dielectric object, ERMS is the RMS value of the applied field strength and fCM is the so-called Claussius-Mossotti factor which relates the magnitude and direction of field-induced polarisation of the particle to that of the particle's surroundings. The Claussius-Mossotti factor may be expressed as: where \u03b5c* and \u03b5m* are the complex permittivities of the particle and its suspending medium respectively. In the case where the particle is an aqueous droplet (\u03b5c* = 78\u201380) and the suspending medium is a liquid hydrocarbon, (\u03b5m* = 2\u20134) fCM is always positive, and hence, so is the DEP force. Therefore, aqueous droplets suspended in liquid hydrocarbon are attracted to the edges of energised electrodes where the electrical lines-of-force most rapidly converge, i.e., where \u2207E2 is greatest. In principle, aqueous droplets may be moved across an electrode array by switching the field from one electrode to another so that the position where the lines-of-force converge are translated laterally. This militates for a low-viscosity fluid such as a short-chain hydrocarbon or silicone. Since DEP does not depend on electrical current there is no inherent tendency for electrochemistry or redox reactions to occur. Also, as the DEP force exerted is a square function of the electrical field gradient, polarity-independent AC fields may be employed to manipulate uncharged species. And, since motion results from droplets seeking a minimum energy configuration within a switchable electric field, a no-moving-parts programmable fluidic processor can be realised in which droplets may be moved and mixed arbitrarily.\nExpansion of the complex Claussius-Mossotti factor reveals that the force applied to a droplet changes only slightly over large ranges of electrical conductivity from 55.6 nS cm\u22121 (triply-distilled water) to 13.4 mS cm\u22121 (isotonic cell culture medium) for AC field frequencies in the range 5\u2013500 kHz. Droplet transport and injection were modelled for a wide range of fluid properties using software developed specifically for this purpose by Coventor, Inc. Such modelling is able to cover the complete range of electrostatically-induced droplet force phenomena from dielectrophoresis to electrowetting. Since DEP does not depend on current flux, and indeed, since even a few microamperes across a micro-droplet results in hydrolysis, the surface electrodes must be passivated with a hydrophobic insulating layer such as Parylene, Teflon, or a fluorosilane. As a practical matter, many insulators tend to be polar, and thus wetting to aqueous solutions. Hence, a coating that renders the final surface hydrophobic is required.\nIntroduction of a dielectric material into a different dielectric medium alters the energy of the overall system. An applied electric field gradient imposed on the orifice of the injector will tend to alter the pressure at the fluid-suspending medium interface, and this pressure change will in turn alter the volume of a nascent droplet. That is, a change in the electrical energy of the system can be translated into a hydrostatic pressure change within the droplet forming system. Consequently, a force results from the dielectric energy change associated with the displacement of the suspending medium by the injected fluid. It should be stressed that this pressure change does not depend upon net charge on the droplet, which distinguishes this dielectric method from those that depend upon net electrostatic charging as a means for injection of droplets or for forming particulates or aerosols. Indeed, when AC fields are used for dielectric injection, the presence of net charge does not alter the pressure induced by the applied AC fields because the time-averaged magnitude of an AC field is zero. Thus, fluids spanning a wide range of electrical conductivities may be accommodated by a dielectrically actuated system.\nThere are a great many factors that influence the droplet injection process, and a complete theoretical treatment is beyond the scope of this study. Several general observations, however, will give a sense of what is involved. The sensitivity of the injection process to the electric field gradient \u2207E is manifested by control of the distance, Z, between the injector orifice and the energised electrode edge, and the lateral extent, e, of the energised electrode. The injector orifice diameter, d, in the context of a given interfacial tension between the injected fluid and the suspending medium influences the size of injected droplets by governing the point at which it is energetically favourable for a droplet to \u201cpinch-off\u201d from the injector and move through the suspending medium to an energised electrode. The hydrostatic pressure, P, applied to the fluid in the injector, acting against the interfacial tension at the injector orifice, or holdoff force, H, influences how much the DEP force is required to pull fluid out of the injector.\nOur experiments demonstrated that injecting controllable aliquots of aqueous droplets into an immiscible dielectric medium is a function of: (1) injector orifice diameter, (2) square of the DEP voltage, V2DEP, (3) fluid system applied pressure: holdoff pressure ratio, P/H, (4) injector orifice-to-electrode edge distance, Z, and (5) electrode lateral edge length, e. Experiments also showed the relative independence of droplet diameter on pressure, but the linear dependence of droplet injection rate on P/H, that the injected droplet diameter diminishes with increasing VDEP, and that at higher voltages the injected droplet diameter is independent of injector/electrode separation. Control of pressure in the fluid handling system and of electric fields on the array permits the injection of droplets of uniform size onto the reaction surface. Larger droplets can be produced in discrete fashion by leaving the field on while metering out a series of droplets to build up a desired aggregate droplet. In Fig. 7 these factors are combined to summarise the interdependence of injector, electrode geometry, and pressure effects. Along the ordinate the diameter of the injected droplet is normalised by the sum of the injector-to-electrode distance and the electrode lateral edge length. Along the abscissa the square of the DEP field (from the applied voltage acting across a fixed distance) is scaled by the injector-to-electrode distance and normalised by the hydrostatic pressure expressed as a ratio to the static holdoff pressure. Droplets with diameters dia/(Z + e)>1 are drawn and spontaneously injected; droplets with diameters dia/(Z + e)<1 (below the red dashed line) are DEP-injected and ejected onto the reaction surface. Injection from larger 3.7 \u00b5m injectors (squares) is possible only at relatively high VDEP. Injection of small droplets is greatly facilitated by having the interior of the injector made hydrophobic by application of a fluorosilane, e.g., Sigmacote\u00ae or FluoroPel\u00ae. And, injected droplets' diameters scale with the electrode dimensions, implying that the electrode size determines the field gradient relative to the injector.\nDroplet-based chemistry permits reagents to be quantised in discrete packets and mixed in strictly stoichiometric ratios. Additionally, droplets provide a way of obviating difficulties in mixing chemicals in channel-based systems where inherently low-Reynolds-number diffusional mixing of mutually miscible fluids slows to the point where special mixing chambers are frequently required.\nSpontaneous fusion of droplets leads to the rapid mixing of the original droplets' contents via passive diffusion. This is because the immiscibility between aqueous and hydrocarbon fluids is related to the entropy associated with the polar water molecules' ability to form a minimum energy lattice structure. Non-polar liquids interrupt the aqueous lattice resulting in a difference in free energy at the water\u2013hydrocarbon interface. A collection of small aqueous droplets will have fewer degrees of freedom to form a minimum-energy lattice than will a single large droplet, and hence, will possess lower entropy. Therefore, large droplets are thermodynamically favoured, and small droplets will spontaneously fuse into large droplets if brought into close proximity.\nTo illustrate, consider the increase in system energy resulting from the introduction of an immiscible droplet into a homogenous medium. From hydrostatics the pressure, P, across the surface of a droplet is a function of the interfacial tension, \u03b3, and the droplet radius, r, or, equivalently, the energy per unit volume:\nRearranging in terms of energy obtains: This energy is additive for each additional droplet introduced into the system. Combining two droplets of radius r1 and r2 changes the overall system energy by an amount The ratio of the final-to-initial energy states, \u2202Efi, for combining droplets of radius r1 and r2 is then:\nFig. 8 graphs the change in system energy, \u2202E, with respect to the change, \u2202, in the final droplet radius. For example, when two droplets of the same radius fuse, the resulting droplet will have a radius 26% greater than the initial droplets, and system energy 21% less than the two-droplet state. For this reason droplets will spontaneously fuse on contact with the release of energy that may take the form of kinetic energy that tends to mix their contents. Note from eqn. (6) that this effect is a function of the droplet radii only, and does not take into account energy changes resulting from chemical reactions resulting from droplet content mixing. Since DEP forces scale with droplet volume (cf.eqn. (1)) it requires no more drive voltage to move large droplets than small ones. In addition, since the radius of a droplet increases with the cube root of its volume, a wide range of stoichiometries can be realised in parallel in droplets of similar size, as we have done in the OPA/BSA assay.\nThe no-moving-parts formation and manipulation of droplets on a two-dimensional reaction surface provides the physical basis for a programmable fluidic processor that can execute useful biochemical analyses autonomously. The protein concentration assay shown in Fig. 6 provides an illustration of one such analysis. Fig. 9 graphs the protein concentration vs. fluorescence intensity of the eight droplets from Fig. 6 (squares) plus seven additional droplets from a separate experiment (circles). A best-fit linear curve is superimposed over the data points, which are graphed on a log\u2013log scale. For droplets that contained sufficient added protein to permit a measurable change in the overall droplet diameter, and hence, change in droplet volume, the diameter difference was measured, and then used to derive a volume change. For droplets that contained insufficient protein for the initial and final droplet diameters to be distinguishable, the added volume was derived from the number and diameter of protein droplets metered into the large droplets as recorded on videotape. Since the droplets could freely expand as fluid was added, the resulting fluorescence was distributed throughout a proportionally larger volume and observed cross-sectional area. Fluorescence values were determined by measuring the mean fluorescence of each droplet as observed by the video camera, subtracting a background value equivalent to the fluorescence from the control droplet, and multiplying this corrected mean fluorescence by the observed droplet cross-sectional area to obtain an integral fluorescence value for each droplet. In this simple assay the minimum observed fluorescence corresponded to a protein concentration of 0.266 \u00b5g ml\u22121, (3.9 nM) and the assay yielded a linear response (R = 0.99) to a protein concentration that spanned three decades from 0.266\u2013232 \u00b5g ml\u22121.\nThis illustrates another consequence of doing droplet chemistry on a \u03bc-array in that the quantity of reagents and analytes used are small; the experiment with the nine droplets of reagent consumed a total of \u223c0.62 \u00b5l of OPA, and \u223c0.5 \u00b5g (7.4 pmole) of BSA. Thus, 100 \u00b5l of OPA reagent and 80 \u00b5g of BSA would be sufficient to run 160 separate assays of this type.\nThe ability to manoeuvre droplets by energising individually addressable electrodes on a 2-dimensional array inherently confers the ability to move multiple droplets in sequence or simultaneously by the activation of multiple electrodes, and the ability to move an ensemble of droplets along arbitrary paths on the array. Though, with an increasing number of droplets to be manoeuvred, the \u201ctraffic control\u201d issues, e.g., maintaining appropriate distances between droplets that it are not desired to fuse, are not trivial, it is possible to automate a sequence of movements under computer control by writing a software script to realise a fully programmable fluidic processor.\nSince the DEP electrodes require only one surface of the PFP, the other surface is free to accommodate diagnostic and analysis hardware such as diode laser/photodiodes. The 60\u2013600 \u00b5m pitch electrode arrays used in these experiments provide ample real estate for solid-state detectors to be incorporated at each electrode position. Since the PFP chamber need only be slightly thicker than the largest droplets, placing diode laser/avalanche photodiode pairs in close proximity opposite the PFP electrodes could potentially realise extremely sensitive fluorescence detection assays as well as droplet position monitoring.\nDetection and analysis problems frequently involve the use of toxic reagents or unstable precursors which are undesirable or impractical to transport and store. The ability to carry out a set of programmable reactions autonomously also implies the ability to synthesise necessary agents on-demand from a set of less toxic or reactive pre-loaded reagents.\nFuture work on a DEP PFP will involve oligonucleotide and protein assembly. As new genomic assays are discovered it will be advantageous to be able to synthesise oligonucleotides or proteins at the point of care. Current technology requires that a new genetic marker be synthesised and replicated on gene chips, then quickly distributed to interested consumers owing to their relatively short shelf lives. The ability to mix droplets containing individual nucleic acid bases capped with photolabile protection groups would enable oligonucleotides to be synthesised \u201con-the-fly\u201d in situ and used immediately in a diagnostic or pathogen detection mode. The programmability of the PFP would make it possible to produce new oligos and proteins by merely updating the software on the PFP or downloading a sequence from the Internet.\nThe results obtained here demonstrate that dielectrophoresis can be used as the basis of a droplet processor in which droplets of different volumes may be moved and fused on a non-wetting reaction surface without requiring contact with a second, conductive surface as required for transport by electrowetting phenomena. Furthermore, our data shows that droplets of different sizes may be injected by dielectrophoresis. For example, Fig. 4 shows the injection of 3 pl droplets into a larger droplet that can be as voluminous as 70 nl. This permits aliquot dilutions of up to 20000, allowing for exquisite control of titrations.\nThe increasing number of diseases that can be identified with specific molecular or genetic markers demonstrates the need to be able to do molecular assays quickly and economically. In the near future, patients will need to be screened not only for the genetic markers for their disease, but for susceptibilities to side effects of prospective treatments. Eventually, this could mean the need to screen up to 1000 genes per patient in order to identify the range of gene targets and drug sensitivities. Considering just cancer: the 1.3 million-plus diagnoses in the US this year means that for this type of molecular biological analyses to be possible, a tremendous reduction in the complexity, cost, and time to do these analyses will have to be realised.\nIn this paper we have presented proof-of-concept experiments using DEP controlled droplet-based chemistry to demonstrate the feasibility of a no-moving-parts programmable fluidic processor, or PFP, that can execute biochemical assays using pico-litre to nano-litre quantities of reagents and analytes on a solid-state, two-dimensional reaction surface. Further development of the PFP, employing multiple injectors containing a wide variety of reagents and analytes, and integrated solid-state detectors will bring rapid, economical, molecular diagnostics to the point of care.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Micro-total analysis systems (\u03bc-TAS) have been brought closer to operational realisation as several technologies have advanced the ability to manipulate sub-micro litre aliquots of biochemical material. Electro-osmotic and electrophoretic forces that can move cells and conductive solvents along glass- and semiconductor-etched capillaries have advanced continuous-flow technologies such as capillary electrophoresis where DC electric fields, selectively applied along branched channels, can yield valve-less routing of cell suspensions and reagents. Progressively sophisticated designs for such devices have been developed, now encompassing three-dimensional channel structures capable of routing and combining suspensions of biological interest in a multitude of ways. In continuous-flow systems channels are used to direct reagent and analyte flow, and to limit lateral diffusion of analytes. Although increasing structural complexity permits a corresponding increase in sophistication of processes, tubes and channels inherently represent a \u201chard-wired\u201d architecture that can exercise only the specific class or sequence of reactions that their physical structures are designed to realise. Drawbacks to continuous-flow \u03bc-TAS systems have been pointed out previously, and include: (1) the possibility of unintended electrochemistry from exposed electrodes interfering with desired processes, (2) the need for micro-pumps or valves, which currently are mechanically complex and have low mean times between failure, (3) dead volumes that can be made small, but not negligible, by making channel dimensions small, and (4) continuity which limits flow control and mandates that flow from one branched channel affects all other channels, unless micro-valves are employed.\nA recent approach to making \u03bcTAS devices that overcomes these continuous flow limitations and allows for the possibility of programmable operation is the use of reaction surfaces whereby samples and reagents in the form of droplets may be combined in different manners according to an arbitrary algorithm. Such an approach demands not only a suitable reaction surface on which droplet chemistry is performed, but also a motive force for the injection and manipulation of the droplets. Electric field-based forces are ideally suited to such droplet manipulations on the microscale. These forces fall into three distinct classes, namely electrophoretic, electrowetting and dielectrophoretic. The first of these depends on the application of large DC fields that are problematical in systems involving conductive suspensions. However, the latter two forces depend on the square of the field strength, allowing AC fields to be used. Fair and Kim have successfully explored the use of electrowetting as the means for creating droplet processors. However, translational electrowetting forces depend sensitively on the difference in wetting between the leading and trailing edge of droplets and it is likely that surface contamination issues may arise in many real world biological analysis problems under these conditions. Additionally, the range of sizes of droplets that can be conveniently injected by this approach is limited by the need to confine the droplets between the top and bottom walls of the manipulation chamber. By careful design of electric field geometries and the use of non-wetting surfaces, dielectrophoretic forces, which act as body forces on the droplet rather than surface forces, can be made to dominate. Batchelder first proposed this method as the basis of a droplet processor, and he and others have demonstrated droplet movement based on dielectrophoresis. Here we present a more complete droplet processor based on dielectrophoresis in which we solve not only the problem of droplet translation on a two-dimensional non-wetting reaction surface, but also the problem of the injection of droplets over a range of scales that allows for the control of reagent titrations.\nDielectric forces do not depend on the movement of charge, but on the polarisability of particles (cells, droplets) relative to their surroundings. By exploiting these properties we have used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to manipulate collections of cells whose interiors may be made dielectrically distinct from a low-conductivity suspending medium. This also permits the manipulation of any type of liquid droplet within a dielectrically distinct immiscible carrier medium enabling the discreteness of droplet-based microchemistry. Secondly, dielectric forces are generated by spatially inhomogeneous electric fields. Hence, DEP requires no mechanical actuation. Thirdly, packaging analytes and reagents into discrete droplets, which also permit accurate quantification of reagents, can obviate dead volumes and continuity issues. This has advantages in that liquid droplets not amenable to triboelectrification may be manipulated, and that since electric fields need not penetrate droplets there need be no energy deposition into or temperature rise within the droplets. Finally, packaging reagents and analytes in discrete droplets remove the need for channels in order to transport materials of interest. Droplets may be manipulated arbitrarily and combined on a two-dimensional \u201creaction surface\u201d. In this paper, we use dielectrophoresis to exert translational forces on uncharged aqueous droplets as a way to manipulate reagent- and analyte-bearing droplets along arbitrary pathways on a two-dimensional reaction surface as well as a way to introduce droplets onto the reaction surface using a no-moving-parts dielectrophoretic injection mechanism. This, in turn, leads to a programmable, and software-reconfigurable \u03bc-TAS. We will describe the principles behind these new methods and illustrate them by demonstrating a simple example of droplet-based microchemistry.\nPFP fabrication: We formed programmable fluidic processor (PFP) reaction spaces by patterning a two-dimensional array of electrodes using standard photolithographic techniques on glass substrates, electrically passivating the electrodes, forming an open fluidic reservoir, adhering a hydrophobic coating, and connecting the resulting device to a computer-controlled switching circuit.\nConventional negative-mask photolithography was employed to fabricate electrodes from glass substrates on which a titanium adhesion layer (25 nm) and gold conduction layer (250 nm) had been vacuum deposited. Initial arrays consisted of eight-by-eight square electrodes, 30, 100, and 300 \u00b5m on a side with each electrode individually connected to a solder pad along two opposite edges of the substrate. A thin (\u223c0.5 \u00b5m) passivation layer, either vacuum-deposited Parylene, or spin-coated amorphous Teflon AF\u00ae was applied to the patterned electrode surface to prevent current flow across, and electro-chemistry on, the reaction surface. Although, PFPs will be fully sealed for clinical use, we used an open-face arrangement for laboratory experiments. A nitrile o-ring was secured to the substrate around the reaction surface's active region to form a reservoir for the suspending medium. Finally, since neither Parylene nor Teflon AF\u00ae were sufficiently hydrophobic, we applied a coating of Fluoro-Pel\u00ae (Cytonix Corporation, Beltsville, MD), to provide a non-conductive, optically transparent, and non-fluorescent surface. The finished electrode array is shown in Fig. 1. In operation, the reservoir was filled with 1-bromododecane, a low-permittivity (\u03b5 = 4.1), low-viscosity (\u03b7 = 3.6 cSt), water-immiscible, hydrocarbon.\nIndividual electrodes on the reaction surface were energized with AC signals up to 180 Vp-p, and frequencies between 5 and 500 kHz generated by a programmable function generator (DS345, Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA) and amplified by variable gain AC amplifiers (model 7500, Krohn-Hite Corp., Avon, MA). The AC signal was distributed to an array of solid-state switches (HV209, Supertex Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) operating under a microcontroller (BASIC stamp, Parallax Inc., Rocklin, CA) that executed a custom VisualBASIC\u00ae program from a laptop computer. Electrodes to be activated were manually selected by checking their graphical representations on the laptop screen. The sequence of activated electrodes was stored as a script, which the driver program would execute at a user-selectable rate.\nThe experimental apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2 was built around an upright microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) mounting a motorized 3-axis platform controllable via either a joystick or computer interface (Ludl Electronic Products, Ltd., Hawthorne, NY). A chilled, 3-chip, colour CCD camera (Hamamatsu model C-5810) was mounted to the microscope and connected to a video frame counter (VC-81, For-A Company, Ltd.) used to label the recorded video sequences, and a videocassette recorder (AG-7350, Panasonic) used to record the experiments. The microscope was equipped with a trans-illuminating quartz-halogen lamp for most viewing applications and a xenon lamp for fluorescence studies. Two fluorescence filter sets (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) were used: (1) Texas Red, excitation = 535\u2013585 nm, emission = 605\u2013680 nm for viewing experiments using Fluorescein; and (2) DAPI, excitation = 360 nm, emission = 440\u2013490 nm for viewing experiments using o-phthalaldehyde.\nIn addition to moving droplets from point-to-point, DEP was used to form droplets at pressurised orifices near electrodes. Hydrostatic pressure, and the interfacial tension between the aqueous/hydrocarbon surface act to \u201chold off\u201d fluid flow from the orifice. This holdoff effect was utilised as a controllable check-valve to prevent spontaneous fluid flow. A DEP field applied near the orifice was used to form aqueous droplets within the less polarisable carrier fluid and inject them onto the reaction surface. A DEP force acting to overcome hydrostatic holdoff enables \u201cno-moving-parts\u201d valving, pumping, and metering of droplets that can then be manipulated. To this end, a fluid handling system consisting of a manual syringe pump, in-line pressure sensor, and micro-pipettes mounted to five-axis Huxley-Wahl micromanipulators (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to position fluid injectors on the reaction surface.\nAqueous droplets 20\u2013500 \u00b5m in diameter were manoeuvred in two-dimensions across 8 \u00d7 8 two-dimensional electrode arrays using DEP forces. The movement of the droplets was controlled by switching a series of electrodes on and off in sequence. Energising an electrode adjacent to a droplet moved the local field energy minimum to that electrode, exerting a lateral force on the droplet in the direction of the new field minimum. The sequence was controlled from a custom, laptop computer-based graphical user interface. The high-permittivity droplet tended to move toward the adjacent electrode where the field lines converged and the E-field gradient was greatest due to the electrode geometry. Fig. 3 shows five frames from a videotape sequence in which a 0.18 nl and two 0.065 nl droplets are manoeuvred across an 8 \u00d7 8 array (30 \u00b5m electrodes) and sequentially combined with a 0.38 nl droplet. Fusion of individual droplets occurred spontaneously when they were brought into close proximity to each other. Fig. 3e shows the resulting 0.69 nl droplet, containing all of the original fluid volume, which has been manoeuvred to the edge of the array. A detailed discussion of droplet movement rate is beyond the scope of this paper, but is a function of the applied electric field, the diameter of the droplet relative to the electrode size, and the Stokes drag on the droplet. The droplets in Fig. 3 traversed the 60 \u00b5m inter-electrode distance in less than 1 video frame (1/30 s), yielding a speed of >1.8 mm s\u22121.\nAs demonstrated for the first time, in this study DEP was used to create a no-moving-parts mechanism for injecting discrete aliquots of fluid onto a reaction surface. Micropipette injectors, filled with de-gassed, triply-distilled water (3 \u00d7 H2O), were immersed in the suspending fluid reservoir and manoeuvred adjacent to an electrode of the array. Injector height above the reaction surface was kept to 10\u201320 \u00b5m. The amplitude and frequency of the DEP voltage, VDEP and fDEP respectively, were controlled from the external DC power supply and function generator. The lateral distance from the injector orifice to the edge of the electrode, Z, was controlled by the Huxley-Wahl micromanipulator. A syringe pump was used to control the pressure, P, of the droplet fluid in the fluid handling system, which was monitored by a custom-built pressure sensor/amplifier. Each droplet injection sequence was videotaped, with each set of operational parameters referenced against a frame counter that recorded the experiment sequence number. Lateral distances and droplet diameters were determined from analysis of digitised videotape images for which the square electrodes provided an accurate metric.\nDroplet injection was initiated by energising the electrode nearest the injector, creating a DEP force on the fluid within the injector directed toward the edges of the energised electrode. Given an appropriate balance of applied VDEP, injector pressure and injector-electrode geometry, fluid would be drawn out of the injector, form a discrete droplet, then separate from the injector and move onto the energised electrode. A balance of forces produced by the applied DEP field drawing fluid from the injector at a given rate and the interfacial tension between the droplet and suspending fluids consistently yielded injected droplets of a uniform size. Fig. 4 shows an 18 \u00b5m diameter (3 pl) droplet in the process of being metered into an existing 42 \u00b5m diameter (39 pl) droplet which is situated on the energised electrode.\nFig. 5 shows two frames of videotape sequence that illustrates the spontaneous fusion of two droplets with passive diffusion and mixing of their contents. Frame (a) shows the two aqueous droplets suspended in liquid hydrocarbon situated on an array composed of individually addressable electrodes 30 \u00b5m on a side separated by 30 \u00b5m open spaces. The droplets were fused by activating intervening electrodes in order to bring them into close proximity where the droplets fused spontaneously as a result of the lower energy/higher entropy configuration afforded by a single large droplet (cf. frame (b)). The spontaneous fusing of discrete droplets lead not only to content mixing in strict stoichiometry of the fusing droplets, but in rapid diffusion of droplet contents as a result of the inward momentum generated by their fusion. From the video frame rate and transverse scale provided by the 30 \u00b5m electrodes it was deduced that the diffusion front moved across the fused droplet in Fig. 5 at \u223c170 \u00b5m s\u22121.\nA fluorescence-based protein determination was performed to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the use of the PFP to execute a droplet-based biochemical analysis. Fig. 6 is an enhanced image of a set of nine droplets distributed on an 8 \u00d7 8 electrode PFP. The droplets were formed using DEP injection to lay down droplets of o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) (Pierce, Rockford, Il) approximately 500 \u00b5m in diameter (65 nl) from a pipette manoeuvred into close proximity to the individually addressable electrodes. Varying amounts of a 0.5 mg ml\u22121 solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) (MW = 68 kD) were then metered into the OPA droplets from a second injector. Individual DEP-injected BSA droplets averaged \u223c70 \u00b5m in diameter yielding repeatable aliquots of 0.18 nl. The resulting fused droplets contained protein concentrations that spanned three decades from 0.266\u2013232 \u00b5g ml\u22121. One droplet, containing no added protein, served as a control for determining background fluorescence. Uniform illumination of the view field with a mercury source produced blue fluorescence by the protein-bound OPA which was observed through a DAPI filter set by a colour CCD camera with a controllable integration time. Digital images recorded with different integration times were compared to quantify the wide range of fluorescence observed.\nOur work is based on understanding that a freely suspended dielectric object will move in such a way as to minimise applied electric field energy. For our purposes here it is sufficient to note that an uncharged, polarisable object in a spatially inhomogeneous electric field is attracted to a region of high electric field gradient (\u2207E) if its polarisability is greater than that of its surroundings.\nThe real part of the time-averaged DEP force \u3008F(t)\u3009 acting on a particle due to an imposed electrical field, E(\u03c9), can be approximated in terms of dipole effects by\nwhere \u03b5m is the permittivity of the suspending medium, r is the radius of the dielectric object, ERMS is the RMS value of the applied field strength and fCM is the so-called Claussius-Mossotti factor which relates the magnitude and direction of field-induced polarisation of the particle to that of the particle's surroundings. The Claussius-Mossotti factor may be expressed as: where \u03b5c* and \u03b5m* are the complex permittivities of the particle and its suspending medium respectively. In the case where the particle is an aqueous droplet (\u03b5c* = 78\u201380) and the suspending medium is a liquid hydrocarbon, (\u03b5m* = 2\u20134) fCM is always positive, and hence, so is the DEP force. Therefore, aqueous droplets suspended in liquid hydrocarbon are attracted to the edges of energised electrodes where the electrical lines-of-force most rapidly converge, i.e., where \u2207E2 is greatest. In principle, aqueous droplets may be moved across an electrode array by switching the field from one electrode to another so that the position where the lines-of-force converge are translated laterally. This militates for a low-viscosity fluid such as a short-chain hydrocarbon or silicone. Since DEP does not depend on electrical current there is no inherent tendency for electrochemistry or redox reactions to occur. Also, as the DEP force exerted is a square function of the electrical field gradient, polarity-independent AC fields may be employed to manipulate uncharged species. And, since motion results from droplets seeking a minimum energy configuration within a switchable electric field, a no-moving-parts programmable fluidic processor can be realised in which droplets may be moved and mixed arbitrarily.\nExpansion of the complex Claussius-Mossotti factor reveals that the force applied to a droplet changes only slightly over large ranges of electrical conductivity from 55.6 nS cm\u22121 (triply-distilled water) to 13.4 mS cm\u22121 (isotonic cell culture medium) for AC field frequencies in the range 5\u2013500 kHz. Droplet transport and injection were modelled for a wide range of fluid properties using software developed specifically for this purpose by Coventor, Inc. Such modelling is able to cover the complete range of electrostatically-induced droplet force phenomena from dielectrophoresis to electrowetting. Since DEP does not depend on current flux, and indeed, since even a few microamperes across a micro-droplet results in hydrolysis, the surface electrodes must be passivated with a hydrophobic insulating layer such as Parylene, Teflon, or a fluorosilane. As a practical matter, many insulators tend to be polar, and thus wetting to aqueous solutions. Hence, a coating that renders the final surface hydrophobic is required.\nIntroduction of a dielectric material into a different dielectric medium alters the energy of the overall system. An applied electric field gradient imposed on the orifice of the injector will tend to alter the pressure at the fluid-suspending medium interface, and this pressure change will in turn alter the volume of a nascent droplet. That is, a change in the electrical energy of the system can be translated into a hydrostatic pressure change within the droplet forming system. Consequently, a force results from the dielectric energy change associated with the displacement of the suspending medium by the injected fluid. It should be stressed that this pressure change does not depend upon net charge on the droplet, which distinguishes this dielectric method from those that depend upon net electrostatic charging as a means for injection of droplets or for forming particulates or aerosols. Indeed, when AC fields are used for dielectric injection, the presence of net charge does not alter the pressure induced by the applied AC fields because the time-averaged magnitude of an AC field is zero. Thus, fluids spanning a wide range of electrical conductivities may be accommodated by a dielectrically actuated system.\nThere are a great many factors that influence the droplet injection process, and a complete theoretical treatment is beyond the scope of this study. Several general observations, however, will give a sense of what is involved. The sensitivity of the injection process to the electric field gradient \u2207E is manifested by control of the distance, Z, between the injector orifice and the energised electrode edge, and the lateral extent, e, of the energised electrode. The injector orifice diameter, d, in the context of a given interfacial tension between the injected fluid and the suspending medium influences the size of injected droplets by governing the point at which it is energetically favourable for a droplet to \u201cpinch-off\u201d from the injector and move through the suspending medium to an energised electrode. The hydrostatic pressure, P, applied to the fluid in the injector, acting against the interfacial tension at the injector orifice, or holdoff force, H, influences how much the DEP force is required to pull fluid out of the injector.\nOur experiments demonstrated that injecting controllable aliquots of aqueous droplets into an immiscible dielectric medium is a function of: (1) injector orifice diameter, (2) square of the DEP voltage, V2DEP, (3) fluid system applied pressure: holdoff pressure ratio, P/H, (4) injector orifice-to-electrode edge distance, Z, and (5) electrode lateral edge length, e. Experiments also showed the relative independence of droplet diameter on pressure, but the linear dependence of droplet injection rate on P/H, that the injected droplet diameter diminishes with increasing VDEP, and that at higher voltages the injected droplet diameter is independent of injector/electrode separation. Control of pressure in the fluid handling system and of electric fields on the array permits the injection of droplets of uniform size onto the reaction surface. Larger droplets can be produced in discrete fashion by leaving the field on while metering out a series of droplets to build up a desired aggregate droplet. In Fig. 7 these factors are combined to summarise the interdependence of injector, electrode geometry, and pressure effects. Along the ordinate the diameter of the injected droplet is normalised by the sum of the injector-to-electrode distance and the electrode lateral edge length. Along the abscissa the square of the DEP field (from the applied voltage acting across a fixed distance) is scaled by the injector-to-electrode distance and normalised by the hydrostatic pressure expressed as a ratio to the static holdoff pressure. Droplets with diameters dia/(Z + e)>1 are drawn and spontaneously injected; droplets with diameters dia/(Z + e)<1 (below the red dashed line) are DEP-injected and ejected onto the reaction surface. Injection from larger 3.7 \u00b5m injectors (squares) is possible only at relatively high VDEP. Injection of small droplets is greatly facilitated by having the interior of the injector made hydrophobic by application of a fluorosilane, e.g., Sigmacote\u00ae or FluoroPel\u00ae. And, injected droplets' diameters scale with the electrode dimensions, implying that the electrode size determines the field gradient relative to the injector.\nDroplet-based chemistry permits reagents to be quantised in discrete packets and mixed in strictly stoichiometric ratios. Additionally, droplets provide a way of obviating difficulties in mixing chemicals in channel-based systems where inherently low-Reynolds-number diffusional mixing of mutually miscible fluids slows to the point where special mixing chambers are frequently required.\nSpontaneous fusion of droplets leads to the rapid mixing of the original droplets' contents via passive diffusion. This is because the immiscibility between aqueous and hydrocarbon fluids is related to the entropy associated with the polar water molecules' ability to form a minimum energy lattice structure. Non-polar liquids interrupt the aqueous lattice resulting in a difference in free energy at the water\u2013hydrocarbon interface. A collection of small aqueous droplets will have fewer degrees of freedom to form a minimum-energy lattice than will a single large droplet, and hence, will possess lower entropy. Therefore, large droplets are thermodynamically favoured, and small droplets will spontaneously fuse into large droplets if brought into close proximity.\nTo illustrate, consider the increase in system energy resulting from the introduction of an immiscible droplet into a homogenous medium. From hydrostatics the pressure, P, across the surface of a droplet is a function of the interfacial tension, \u03b3, and the droplet radius, r, or, equivalently, the energy per unit volume:\nRearranging in terms of energy obtains: This energy is additive for each additional droplet introduced into the system. Combining two droplets of radius r1 and r2 changes the overall system energy by an amount The ratio of the final-to-initial energy states, \u2202Efi, for combining droplets of radius r1 and r2 is then:\nFig. 8 graphs the change in system energy, \u2202E, with respect to the change, \u2202, in the final droplet radius. For example, when two droplets of the same radius fuse, the resulting droplet will have a radius 26% greater than the initial droplets, and system energy 21% less than the two-droplet state. For this reason droplets will spontaneously fuse on contact with the release of energy that may take the form of kinetic energy that tends to mix their contents. Note from eqn. (6) that this effect is a function of the droplet radii only, and does not take into account energy changes resulting from chemical reactions resulting from droplet content mixing. Since DEP forces scale with droplet volume (cf.eqn. (1)) it requires no more drive voltage to move large droplets than small ones. In addition, since the radius of a droplet increases with the cube root of its volume, a wide range of stoichiometries can be realised in parallel in droplets of similar size, as we have done in the OPA/BSA assay.\nThe no-moving-parts formation and manipulation of droplets on a two-dimensional reaction surface provides the physical basis for a programmable fluidic processor that can execute useful biochemical analyses autonomously. The protein concentration assay shown in Fig. 6 provides an illustration of one such analysis. Fig. 9 graphs the protein concentration vs. fluorescence intensity of the eight droplets from Fig. 6 (squares) plus seven additional droplets from a separate experiment (circles). A best-fit linear curve is superimposed over the data points, which are graphed on a log\u2013log scale. For droplets that contained sufficient added protein to permit a measurable change in the overall droplet diameter, and hence, change in droplet volume, the diameter difference was measured, and then used to derive a volume change. For droplets that contained insufficient protein for the initial and final droplet diameters to be distinguishable, the added volume was derived from the number and diameter of protein droplets metered into the large droplets as recorded on videotape. Since the droplets could freely expand as fluid was added, the resulting fluorescence was distributed throughout a proportionally larger volume and observed cross-sectional area. Fluorescence values were determined by measuring the mean fluorescence of each droplet as observed by the video camera, subtracting a background value equivalent to the fluorescence from the control droplet, and multiplying this corrected mean fluorescence by the observed droplet cross-sectional area to obtain an integral fluorescence value for each droplet. In this simple assay the minimum observed fluorescence corresponded to a protein concentration of 0.266 \u00b5g ml\u22121, (3.9 nM) and the assay yielded a linear response (R = 0.99) to a protein concentration that spanned three decades from 0.266\u2013232 \u00b5g ml\u22121.\nThis illustrates another consequence of doing droplet chemistry on a \u03bc-array in that the quantity of reagents and analytes used are small; the experiment with the nine droplets of reagent consumed a total of \u223c0.62 \u00b5l of OPA, and \u223c0.5 \u00b5g (7.4 pmole) of BSA. Thus, 100 \u00b5l of OPA reagent and 80 \u00b5g of BSA would be sufficient to run 160 separate assays of this type.\nThe ability to manoeuvre droplets by energising individually addressable electrodes on a 2-dimensional array inherently confers the ability to move multiple droplets in sequence or simultaneously by the activation of multiple electrodes, and the ability to move an ensemble of droplets along arbitrary paths on the array. Though, with an increasing number of droplets to be manoeuvred, the \u201ctraffic control\u201d issues, e.g., maintaining appropriate distances between droplets that it are not desired to fuse, are not trivial, it is possible to automate a sequence of movements under computer control by writing a software script to realise a fully programmable fluidic processor.\nSince the DEP electrodes require only one surface of the PFP, the other surface is free to accommodate diagnostic and analysis hardware such as diode laser/photodiodes. The 60\u2013600 \u00b5m pitch electrode arrays used in these experiments provide ample real estate for solid-state detectors to be incorporated at each electrode position. Since the PFP chamber need only be slightly thicker than the largest droplets, placing diode laser/avalanche photodiode pairs in close proximity opposite the PFP electrodes could potentially realise extremely sensitive fluorescence detection assays as well as droplet position monitoring.\nDetection and analysis problems frequently involve the use of toxic reagents or unstable precursors which are undesirable or impractical to transport and store. The ability to carry out a set of programmable reactions autonomously also implies the ability to synthesise necessary agents on-demand from a set of less toxic or reactive pre-loaded reagents.\nFuture work on a DEP PFP will involve oligonucleotide and protein assembly. As new genomic assays are discovered it will be advantageous to be able to synthesise oligonucleotides or proteins at the point of care. Current technology requires that a new genetic marker be synthesised and replicated on gene chips, then quickly distributed to interested consumers owing to their relatively short shelf lives. The ability to mix droplets containing individual nucleic acid bases capped with photolabile protection groups would enable oligonucleotides to be synthesised \u201con-the-fly\u201d in situ and used immediately in a diagnostic or pathogen detection mode. The programmability of the PFP would make it possible to produce new oligos and proteins by merely updating the software on the PFP or downloading a sequence from the Internet.\nThe results obtained here demonstrate that dielectrophoresis can be used as the basis of a droplet processor in which droplets of different volumes may be moved and fused on a non-wetting reaction surface without requiring contact with a second, conductive surface as required for transport by electrowetting phenomena. Furthermore, our data shows that droplets of different sizes may be injected by dielectrophoresis. For example, Fig. 4 shows the injection of 3 pl droplets into a larger droplet that can be as voluminous as 70 nl. This permits aliquot dilutions of up to 20000, allowing for exquisite control of titrations.\nThe increasing number of diseases that can be identified with specific molecular or genetic markers demonstrates the need to be able to do molecular assays quickly and economically. In the near future, patients will need to be screened not only for the genetic markers for their disease, but for susceptibilities to side effects of prospective treatments. Eventually, this could mean the need to screen up to 1000 genes per patient in order to identify the range of gene targets and drug sensitivities. Considering just cancer: the 1.3 million-plus diagnoses in the US this year means that for this type of molecular biological analyses to be possible, a tremendous reduction in the complexity, cost, and time to do these analyses will have to be realised.\nIn this paper we have presented proof-of-concept experiments using DEP controlled droplet-based chemistry to demonstrate the feasibility of a no-moving-parts programmable fluidic processor, or PFP, that can execute biochemical assays using pico-litre to nano-litre quantities of reagents and analytes on a solid-state, two-dimensional reaction surface. Further development of the PFP, employing multiple injectors containing a wide variety of reagents and analytes, and integrated solid-state detectors will bring rapid, economical, molecular diagnostics to the point of care."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nMolecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have become one of the important sources of stationary phases for the chromatography of drugs and other biological compounds. Their widespread application and preparation methods have gained much attention as shown in many reviews . The technique for preparing these polymers involves polymerization of functional monomers and a crosslinking monomer around a template. Prior to polymerization, a complex is formed by the interactions between functional monomers and the template. After removal of template molecules, specific recognition sites are created in the imprinted polymer for the adsorption of template. The formation of complex can be in either covalent or non-covalent manner. The covalent imprinting is superior in preventing leakage of template molecules during polymerization, because of the formation of labile covalent bonds between functional groups of the template and those of monomer. In order to remove the template, the covalent bonds connecting the template to the polymer should be cleaved. On the other hand, non-covalent imprinting has been reported to be a more direct and flexible approach because of its use of a larger range of compounds including chiral molecules that can be imprinted . The removal of print molecules is more straightforward, in comparison with covalent imprinting.\nFor non-covalent imprinting, methacrylic acid and vinylpyridine have been commonly used as the functional monomers, which provide the function groups interacting with the template. The drugs for print include \u03b2-blockers, derivatives of amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, and diazepam derivatives . Covalent imprinting was first suggested by Wulff et al. . They used vinyl derivatives as the functional monomers, which were bound with print molecule via covalent binding, and then co-polymerized with crosslinking monomer in an inert solution. The resultant co-polymer particles have an accessibility to print molecules. When the particles were used as the chromatographic support, print molecules could selectively adsorb on the support and be separated from the mixture. Whitcombe and co-workers employed the covalent imprinting method to prepare MIPs using cholesterol and other steroids as the templates. Based on their method, the imprinting of cholesterol, a compound with a single hydroxyl group, is performed by relying on the use of a 4-vinylphenyl carbonate ester. The latter functions as a covalently template-bound monomer, which is efficiently cleaved hydrolytically, with the loss of carbon dioxide, resulting in a recognition site that interacts with the print molecule through hydrogen bonding. Non-covalent imprinting of cholesterol was also promising in the polymer of acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, or \u03b2-cyclodextrin, or even copolymers of these compounds . Most of the cholesterol-imprinted polymers prepared by the non-covalent method involved polymerization initiated with gamma rays .\nThe present paper describes the use of both covalent and non-covalent methods for the imprinting of cholesterol and the discovery of chromatographic characteristics using the resultant imprinted polymeric particles. By covalent imprinting, the bulk polymerization of the complex formed from cholesterol-bound functional monomer and crosslinker (crosslinking monomer). While when non-covalent imprinting was used, the bulk polymerization was carried out simply on the mixture of cholesterol, functional monomer and crosslinker. Non-covalent interactions were present and to stabilize the complex of template and monomer during polymerization. Two different functional monomers were used for the non-covalent approach.\nMethacrylic acid (99%), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 98%), acetic acid and glacial acetic acid were obtained from Merck (Germany) and used as received. 2,2\u2032-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was obtained from TCI (Tokyo, Japan). Potassium hydroxide was from Hayashi Chemical Industry Co. (Japan). Acetone and acetonitrile were from J.T. Baker (USA) and all of HPLC grade. Chloroform and methanol were from Mallinckrodt (USA) and of GC grade. Triethylamine and p-acetoxystyrene were obtained from Aldrich (USA) and dichloromethane from Riedel-de Haen (Germany). Cholesterol (95%), 4-vinylpyridine, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-4-methylphenol and cholesteryl chloroformate (97%) were purchased from Acros (USA). \u03b2-Estradiol and o-phthalaldehyde were obtained from Sigma (MO, USA). All chemicals were used without further purification.\nThe template-containing monomer, cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate, was prepared by the method of Whitcombe et al. . Briefly, to a cooled solution (in an ice-bath) of 4-vinylphenol (2 g, 16.6 mmol) in THF (60 ml) and triethylamine (4 ml) containing a trace of 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-4-methylphenol was added dropwise a solution of cholesteryl chloroformate (7.5 g, 16.6 mmol) in THF (40 ml), and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After the removal of solvent by filtration, the product was washed with water, dried and evaporated. 4-Vinylphenol was prepared according to the method of Corson et al. . Briefly, a mixture of 16.2 g (0.1 mol) p-acetoxystyrene and 13.8 g (0.25 mol) potassium hydroxide in 140 ml of water was stirred at 0\u20135 \u00b0C. Gaseous carbon dioxide was passed into the stirred solution to pH 8 to produce 4-vinylphenol.\nFor the preparation of MIP by the covalent imprinting method, the prepared cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate (0.62 g) was mixed with EGDMA (4.38 g), AIBN (74.5 mg) in the solvent hexane and allowed bulk polymerization at 65 \u00b0C in the water bath for 24 h. The resultant polymer was dried and ground and sieved. Powders with a size ranging from 25 to 44 \u03bcm were collected for batch adsorption and packing chromatographic columns. To remove the template molecule, polymer particles were suspended and refluxed with NaOH in methanol. After reflux for 6 h, carbon dioxide was passed into the suspension to reduce the pH to 7. The particles were then extensively washed with water and methanol until no more cholesterol was released.\nThe MIP stationary phase was prepared by the method of bulk polymerization at low temperature. Methacrylic acid and 4-vinylpyridine were, respectively, used as the functional monomer to prepare the MIP by the non-covalent imprinting method. Briefly, cholesterol (0.387 g), methacrylic acid (0.682 ml), EGDMA (4.72 ml), and AIBN (0.05 g) were dissolved in 7.5 ml of chloroform in a conical Erlenmeyer flask. After degassing and nitrogen purging, the flask was sealed and allowed to polymerize at 4 \u00b0C for 6 h under UV (365 nm, 100 W lamp) irradiation. When 4-vinylpyridine was used as the functional monomer, the recipe was cholesterol (0.387 g), 4-vinylpyridine (0.112 ml), EGDMA (2.52 ml) and AIBN (0.02 g); all were dissolved in 7.5 ml of chloroform. EGDMA was used here as the crosslinking monomer and AIBN as the free radical initiator. After the polymerization, the chloroform was removed and the polymer product was dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the bulk MIPs resulting from two different recipes were separately ground and sieved. For each MIP, the fraction of powders having a particle size ranging from 25 to 44 \u03bcm was collected for packing a chromatographic column. Template molecules were removed from the particles after packing into columns by continuously washing with acetonitrile until a stable baseline was reached.\nCholesterol-imprinted particles were suspended in methanol by sonication and then slurry packed into 25 cm\u00d70.46 cm I.D. stainless-steel columns using an air-driven fluid pump with acetone as the solvent. The backpressure for packing was 300 bar. For the HPLC analysis, a 10-\u03bcl sample solution was injected and eluted isocratically at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min, using a mixture of water and acetonitrile (1:19) as the mobile phase. The temperature was kept at 25 \u00b0C. Measuring the absorbance at 210 nm constantly monitored the effluent solution. Toluene was used as the non-retained component for the determination of the void fraction for each column. Capacity factors (k\u2032) were calculated according to standard chromatographic theory as k\u2032=(t R\u2212t 0)/t 0, where t R is the retention time of cholesterol or \u03b2-estradiol, and the retention time of toluene was used as the retention time of the non-retained component, t 0. The separation factor (\u03b1) was defined as the ratio of capacity factor of cholesterol to that of \u03b2-estradiol. The plate number was calculated based on the formula: N=5.54(t R/W 0.5h)2, where W 0.5h is the peak width at half-height.\nFor the batch adsorption, a specific amount (20 mg) of imprinted polymer particles was incubated with 3 ml of cholesterol solution in glacial acetic acid with different concentrations at 25 \u00b0C for 3 h. The amount of cholesterol adsorbed on the MIPs was estimated by determining the loss of cholesterol in the solution. Adsorption isotherms were obtained by plotting the amount of cholesterol adsorbed onto particles vs. the concentration of cholesterol in the final solution. The concentration of cholesterol was assayed by the method using an o-phthalaldehyde reagent . The o-phthalaldehyde reagent was prepared by dissolving 25 mg of o-phthalaldehyde in 50 ml of glacial acetic acid. A small volume (0.1 ml) of cholesterol sample or each standard prepared by dissolving cholesterol in glacial acetic acid was well mixed with 2 ml of o-phthalaldehyde reagent, and then with 1 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid thoroughly. After 10 min, the absorbance of the color formed was measured against a reagent blank at 550 nm. The calibration curve obtained from a series of standards was used for the determination of cholesterol concentration in the sample.\nAll the prepared MIPs were cross-linked polymers and successfully introduced recognition sites for cholesterol. They were ground into powders and the fraction having a particle size ranging from 25 to 44 \u03bcm was selected for packing of columns. There was apparently no difference among these MIPs using cholesterol as the template (print molecule), all were white powders after grinding. Fig. 1 shows the hypothetical formation of these cholesterol-imprinted polymers resulting from the free-radical polymerization in the bulk mode. After the removal of the template molecules, all the cholesterol-imprinted polymers were able to selectively adsorb cholesterol from the solution. However, the chromatographic behaviors were different using the polymers as stationary phases. Results from the liquid chromatography of cholesterol on imprinted polymers prepared by covalent method using cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate as the covalently template-bound monomer and non-covalent method using either methacrylic acid or 4-vinylpyridine as the functional monomer are shown in Figs. 2\u20135 . Fig. 2 shows typical peak profiles from the chromatographic separation of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol using these MIPs. As shown in Fig. 3 , every component has the same retention time both when eluted in mixture and alone. For either cholesterol or \u03b2-estradiol, the peak area eluted alone was found to be almost double that eluted in mixture, in concordance with the fact that the amount of each component in the mixture sample is half that in the pure sample. Samples with different combinations of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol concentrations in a total of 1 g/l were applied to columns packed with different MIPs. The retention time and capacity factor for each component were collected and plotted in Figs. 4 and 5 . The chromatographic separation using these MIPs was reproducible and each data point reported in these figures was an average taken from 2 to 4 runs for each combination of solute concentrations. Fig. 5 also shows the selectivity of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol resulting from each column. Table 1 summarizes the results of chromatographic separation between cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol using these three types of MIPs.\nFor different combinations of \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol concentrations with a total of 1 g/l, the peak retention times for both compounds were nearly constant, although the peak height and peak area for each compound increased with concentration in the sample. With the change in sample concentration, the plate number also remained unchanged for all these columns packed with different cholesterol-imprinted polymers. As shown in Fig. 4, \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol had the longest retention times in the column packed with 4-vinylpyridine-based non-covalently imprinted polymer and shortest retention times in the column with methacrylic acid-based imprinted polymer. These two compounds had a medium retention but much sharper peaks when they were chromatographized on the covalently imprinted polymer.\nCholesterol is a 27-carbon alcohol and the major sterol in the human and animal body. Cholesterol has a hydroxyl group at C3 position and an eight-carbon branched aliphatic group attached to C17. \u03b2-Estradiol has also a hydroxyl group connected to C3 but differs from cholesterol by substituting the branched aliphatic group at C17 position with a hydroxyl group (17-\u03b2-hydroxyl) and lacking a methyl group at C19 position. Therefore, \u03b2-estradiol could stay in the MIPs column for a longer time than toluene (as a non-retained compound) due to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group on its C3 position and immobilized acid or pyridine group. As shown in Table 1, the interactions of \u03b2-estradiol to carboxylic groups of immobilized methacrylic acid and phenolic groups of the covalently imprinted polymer contributed capacity factors of 1.0 and 1.1, respectively. While the interaction between \u03b2-estradiol and 4-vinylpyridine contributed a capacity factor of 1.4. Since the volume phase ratios for these MIPs columns are unknown, that the latter interaction is stronger than the other two types of weak interactions is possible but could not be asserted. In comparison with cholesterol, the \u03b2-estradiol molecule is smaller and more hydrophilic. Due to this hydrophilic property, the stay of \u03b2-estradiol in those columns could be changed by the composition of mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water. As the water content in the mobile phase increased, the retention of cholesterol did not change too much, but the retention of \u03b2-estradiol increased significantly (data not shown).\nAs shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5, capacity factors for cholesterol from the columns packed with covalently imprinted polymer and 4-vinylpyridine-based non-covalently imprinted polymer, were 3.5 and 4.0, respectively, which were higher than that obtained from the column with methacrylic acid-based non-covalently imprinted polymer (3.1). The average separation factors for resolution of \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol, however, were 3.2, 3.0 and 2.9, respectively, resulting from the columns with MIPs made by covalent and non-covalent imprinting using methacrylic acid and 4-vinylpyridine. These separation factors are all higher and not too much different from each other, suggesting that selection mechanisms involving the binding of \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol to the recognition sites are very similar for these three MIPs. The successful separation is believed to be dependent on the biospecific adsorption of cholesterol to the recognition sites left by the removed templates due to the shape complementary. The reproducibility of column packing was also good. The alternative column packed with MIPs prepared by non-covalent imprinting using either methacrylic acid or 4-vinylpyridine resulted in almost the same peak retention and column efficiency as those in Table 1.\nThe covalent and non-covalent imprinting methods are different from each other in the formation of specific recognition sites in highly cross-linked porous polymers. The covalent imprinting involves the use of covalently template-bound monomer, in this study cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate, which becomes fixed in their spatial arrangement by co-polymerization with crosslinking monomer. In the non-covalent imprinting, molecules of functional monomer assemble around the template (cholesterol) by non-covalent interactions to form the recognition site after co-polymerization with crosslinker. Removal of the template from the crosslinked polymers yields cavities that are shaped complimentary to cholesterol. This could be done by cleavage of covalent bonds and release of carbon dioxides from the polymer prepared by the covalent imprinting. The release of template from the polymers prepared by non-covalent imprinting was simply done by extraction with the solvent. However, the re-adsorption of cholesterol to the imprinted polymers prepared by either covalent or non-covalent imprinting method is always in a non-covalent manner.\nFor the preparation of cholesterol-imprinting polymer by covalent method, cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate should be prepared prior to polymerization. In the present study, this template-containing monomer was prepared by reacting 4-vinylphenol to cholesteryl chloroformate, where 4-vinylphenol was synthesized from p-acetoxystyrene and carbon dioxide under alkaline conditions. A 99.5% yield was obtained with an m.p. of 68.2 \u00b0C for the resultant 4-vinylphenol. This m.p. for 4-vinylphenol is within the range of reported values of 68\u201369 \u00b0C . The yield for cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate synthesis was 47% and the product was a light-khaki-colored solid with an m.p. of 146.3 \u00b0C, which is also within the range of reported values (146\u2013147 \u00b0C) .\nAlthough polymers were all prepared in bulk polymerization with free radicals initiated by an azo-initiator, the polymerization proceeded at different temperatures. For covalent imprinting the template-bound monomer and crosslinker (EGDMA) co-polymerized at 65 \u00b0C. But for non-covalent imprinting, the functional monomer (methacrylic acid or 4-vinylpyridine) and EGDMA were allowed for polymerization at 4 \u00b0C. This low temperature was necessary to maintain the template in the positions by non-covalent interactions during the polymerization. The low temperature polymerization method was previously used to imprint a large range of compounds including chiral molecules .\nA significant advantage of using covalent imprinting was found to be that it resulted in an imprinting polymer with higher chromatographic efficiency as shown in Fig. 2. The average plate number for the elution peak of cholesterol from the column packed with covalently imprinted polymer was determined to be 1240 (Table 1). In comparison with results from columns packed with non-covalently imprinted polymers using MAA and 4-vinylpyridine, 220 and 260, respectively, the plate number is about fivefold larger. A higher plate number represents a better column efficiency. These results suggest that the formation mechanism and the resultant distribution of recognition sites on the imprinted polymers are different between imprinting methods. In the covalent imprinting, the template molecule is covalently bound to the monomer and after polymerization the template occupies exactly the position of the recognition site. Each recognition site formed after the release of template was shown to bind one molecule of cholesterol through hydrogen bonding. As reported in a previous study, the covalently imprinted polymer was shown capable of interacting with cholesterol with a single dissociation . On the contrary, the complexes in the non-covalent imprinting were formed from template and functional monomer in a somewhat loose manner. Cholesterol has only one hydroxyl group that could interact with the functional monomer to form a complex. Since the complexes were formed simply by just mixing these two together and stabilized by weak interactions like hydrogen bonding during the polymerization, the construct of future recognition sites was looser in comparison with covalent imprinting and even contained aggregates of two or more of the template molecules. This resulted in a heterogeneous distribution of recognition sites with respect to the affinity for cholesterol in the imprinted polymer, and finally a peak broadening and tailing when the polymer was used in liquid chromatography. The disadvantage of peak broadening and tailing is usually associated with imprinted polymers in use as the chromatographic supports . Factors claimed to contribute to peak broadening are mass transfer limitations, heterogeneous distribution of sites from high to low affinity for the print molecule, and variable association and dissociation kinetics . This study suggests that the use of covalent imprinting could yield an imprinted polymer having less heterogeneous distribution in recognition sites that led to a higher chromatographic efficiency. The peak broadening could significantly be reduced, as shown in Fig. 2 (peak 1) and Fig. 3. The slight peak broadening and tailing remaining could be due to the fact that MIPs are prepared as bulk polymers, and then ground and sized into irregular particles of 25 to 44 \u03bcm before packing into columns. The higher plate number and conservation in retention as shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the covalently imprinted polymer has potential for quantitative analysis of the print compound.\nAlthough the formation of complexes from template and monomer was different for covalent and non-covalent imprinting, resultant imprinted polymers all had non-covalent recognition sites. However, different immobilized groups on the recognition sites were involved in the adsorption of cholesterol to those polymers. The immobilized group along the recognition sites were inherited from the monomer employed for cholesterol imprinting. After removal of template, the covalently imprinted polymer had phenolic groups that could interact with the hydroxyl groups of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol. The immobilized phenolic groups behaved similar to the carboxylic group in methacrylic acid-based MIP; these two cholesterol-imprinted polymers had the same retention time for toluene (2.5 min at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min). Also, the retention times of \u03b2-estradiol on these two polymers were very close (5.3 and 5.1 min, respectively). The polymer prepared with 4-vinylpyridine however had longer retention times of toluene, \u03b2-estradiol, and cholesterol (Table 1).\nFor the re-adsorption of cholesterol (print molecule) onto the MIPs, the adsorption capacity was found to significantly depend on the use of functional monomer. The binding capacity sometimes represents the density of effective recognition sites on the polymer. Batch adsorption of cholesterol as shown in Fig. 6 revealed that the binding capacity of the methacrylic acid-based polymer was the smallest one among these three MIPs. The equilibrium adsorption data for these cholesterol-imprinted polymers could fit to the Langmuir isotherms with a coefficient of determination (R 2) in the range of 0.870\u20130.887. The best fittings (dashed curve in the linear plot of Fig. 6) yield the maximum binding capacities of 95, 73, and 65 \u03bcmol/g polymer particle, respectively, for cholesterol-imprinted polymers prepared by the methods of covalent and non-covalent imprinting using 4-vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid as the functional monomers. However, as shown in Fig. 6, the data fitted well to the Langmuir\u2013Freundlich (R 2=0.971\u20130.978, solid curves in linear plot) and Freundlich isotherm (R 2=0.967\u20130.978, solid lines in log plot). The good fit of MIPs adsorption to the Langmuir\u2013Freundlich isotherm suggests that a unimodal heterogeneous distribution of binding sites was present in the MIPs . The covalently imprinted polymer was found to have the lowest degree of binding site heterogeneity with the highest heterogeneity index. Since the heterogeneity has been claimed as a main contributor to peak broadening and asymmetry, the MIPs obtained from covalent imprinting led to less peak broadening as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe result obtained in this study is close to that reported by Whitcombe et al. . The covalent cholesterol-imprinted polymer they made has a maximum capacity of 114\u00b16 \u03bcmol/g, for cholesterol binding. In another experiment on the adsorption of 100 mg particles in 10 ml of cholesterol solution (1 g/l), the covalently imprinted polymer prepared in the present study could adsorb 58\u00b19 \u03bcmol/g, while the non-covalently imprinted polymers with 4-vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid as the monomers could adsorb 52\u00b111 and 20\u00b12 \u03bcmol/g of cholesterol, respectively. These results suggest that the adsorption capacity of the MIPs was dependent on the functional monomer used to form a complex with template, and the immobilized group in the polymer along the recognition sites significantly influenced the adsorption of cholesterol. Under the same adsorption conditions, the cholesterol-printed poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) adsorbed 3.92 mg/g (=10.1 \u03bcmol/g) cholesterol . In other similar adsorption experiments, Sreenivasan reported that the MIPs made by using 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and N-vinyl pyrrolidone as the monomer adsorbed 4.86 mg/g (=12.6 \u03bcmol/g) and 3.06 mg/g (=7.9 \u03bcmol/g) cholesterol, respectively .\nIn this study, two different functional monomers were used for forming a template\u2013monomer complex prior to polymerization in the non-covalent imprinting method. Although methacrylic acid is the commonly used monomer for non-covalent imprinting, the use of other electrophilic group-containing monomers like 4-vinylpyridine might be also useful. The low-temperature synthesized polymer using 4-vinylpyridine was a slightly yellow bulk, but it turned to white powders after drying and grinding. After the removal of the template, the bound pyridine on the 4-vinylpyridine-based MIP seemed to have a stronger interaction to hydroxyl groups of sterols, reflecting the increase of capacity factors for \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol. Also the bound pyridine groups were able to interact with hydrophobic compounds. Toluene thus could stay a longer time in the column under the same mobile phase conditions. However, the separation factors were higher and almost the same for these two non-covalently imprinted columns. This suggests that the selectivity in the chromatography was mainly based on the affinity of shape match to the cavity created by template printing.\nIn this study, we have demonstrated chromatographic behaviors using molecularly imprinted polymers as stationary phases, prepared by different approaches. Three types of cholesterol-imprinted polymers were prepared and, after removal of template, used as the stationary phase for the chromatographic separation of cholesterol from other steroids. One of the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) was obtained by covalent imprinting involving the use of cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate as the covalently template-bound monomer, while the other two MIPs were obtained by non-covalent imprinting method. Although the non-covalent imprinting was much easier to practice, the formation of complex by simply mixing template and monomer in solution prior to polymerization could lead to a higher heterogeneity of recognition sites on the resultant imprinted polymers and result in peak broadening for the cholesterol chromatography. On the contrary, the covalently imprinted polymer resulted in a much higher chromatographic efficiency, which shows potential for quantitative analysis. The adsorption capacity of the MIPs was found to depend on the functional monomer used to form a complex with the template, and the immobilized group in the polymer along the recognition site significantly influenced the adsorption of cholesterol. The MIP prepared by covalent imprinting was found to bind more cholesterol. However, among these imprinted polymers the difference in the selectivity for chromatographic separation of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol was insignificant, suggesting that the separation was based on the specific binding of cholesterol to recognition sites. The study also reveals some important properties of MIP when applied for chromatographic separation.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

But for non-covalent imprinting, the functional monomer and crosslinker were allowed to polymerize at 4 \u00b0C, which was necessary to maintain the template in the positions by non-covalent interactions during the polymerization.\n\nQ10: Explain the concept of \"heterogeneous distribution\" in the context of MIPs. \nA10: Heterogeneous distribution in this context refers to a situation where the recognition sites for cholesterol are not evenly distributed along the polymer chain. This can lead to peak broadening and tailing, which are undesirable effects in chromatographic separations. The study suggests that the use of covalent imprinting can yield an imprinted polymer having less heterogeneous distribution, leading to a higher chromatographic efficiency.",

Their widespread application and preparation methods have gained much attention as shown in many reviews . The technique for preparing these polymers involves polymerization of functional monomers and a crosslinking monomer around a template. Prior to polymerization, a complex is formed by the interactions between functional monomers and the template. After removal of template molecules, specific recognition sites are created in the imprinted polymer for the adsorption of template. The formation of complex can be in either covalent or non-covalent manner. The covalent imprinting is superior in preventing leakage of template molecules during polymerization, because of the formation of labile covalent bonds between functional groups of the template and those of monomer. In order to remove the template, the covalent bonds connecting the template to the polymer should be cleaved. On the other hand, non-covalent imprinting has been reported to be a more direct and flexible approach because of its use of a larger range of compounds including chiral molecules that can be imprinted . The removal of print molecules is more straightforward, in comparison with covalent imprinting.\nFor non-covalent imprinting, methacrylic acid and vinylpyridine have been commonly used as the functional monomers, which provide the function groups interacting with the template. The drugs for print include \u03b2-blockers, derivatives of amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, and diazepam derivatives . Covalent imprinting was first suggested by Wulff et al. . They used vinyl derivatives as the functional monomers, which were bound with print molecule via covalent binding, and then co-polymerized with crosslinking monomer in an inert solution. The resultant co-polymer particles have an accessibility to print molecules. When the particles were used as the chromatographic support, print molecules could selectively adsorb on the support and be separated from the mixture. Whitcombe and co-workers employed the covalent imprinting method to prepare MIPs using cholesterol and other steroids as the templates. Based on their method, the imprinting of cholesterol, a compound with a single hydroxyl group, is performed by relying on the use of a 4-vinylphenyl carbonate ester. The latter functions as a covalently template-bound monomer, which is efficiently cleaved hydrolytically, with the loss of carbon dioxide, resulting in a recognition site that interacts with the print molecule through hydrogen bonding. Non-covalent imprinting of cholesterol was also promising in the polymer of acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, or \u03b2-cyclodextrin, or even copolymers of these compounds . Most of the cholesterol-imprinted polymers prepared by the non-covalent method involved polymerization initiated with gamma rays .\nThe present paper describes the use of both covalent and non-covalent methods for the imprinting of cholesterol and the discovery of chromatographic characteristics using the resultant imprinted polymeric particles. By covalent imprinting, the bulk polymerization of the complex formed from cholesterol-bound functional monomer and crosslinker (crosslinking monomer). While when non-covalent imprinting was used, the bulk polymerization was carried out simply on the mixture of cholesterol, functional monomer and crosslinker. Non-covalent interactions were present and to stabilize the complex of template and monomer during polymerization. Two different functional monomers were used for the non-covalent approach.\nMethacrylic acid (99%), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 98%), acetic acid and glacial acetic acid were obtained from Merck (Germany) and used as received. 2,2\u2032-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was obtained from TCI (Tokyo, Japan). Potassium hydroxide was from Hayashi Chemical Industry Co. (Japan). Acetone and acetonitrile were from J.T. Baker (USA) and all of HPLC grade. Chloroform and methanol were from Mallinckrodt (USA) and of GC grade. Triethylamine and p-acetoxystyrene were obtained from Aldrich (USA) and dichloromethane from Riedel-de Haen (Germany). Cholesterol (95%), 4-vinylpyridine, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-4-methylphenol and cholesteryl chloroformate (97%) were purchased from Acros (USA). \u03b2-Estradiol and o-phthalaldehyde were obtained from Sigma (MO, USA). All chemicals were used without further purification.\nThe template-containing monomer, cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate, was prepared by the method of Whitcombe et al. . Briefly, to a cooled solution (in an ice-bath) of 4-vinylphenol (2 g, 16.6 mmol) in THF (60 ml) and triethylamine (4 ml) containing a trace of 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-4-methylphenol was added dropwise a solution of cholesteryl chloroformate (7.5 g, 16.6 mmol) in THF (40 ml), and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After the removal of solvent by filtration, the product was washed with water, dried and evaporated. 4-Vinylphenol was prepared according to the method of Corson et al. . Briefly, a mixture of 16.2 g (0.1 mol) p-acetoxystyrene and 13.8 g (0.25 mol) potassium hydroxide in 140 ml of water was stirred at 0\u20135 \u00b0C. Gaseous carbon dioxide was passed into the stirred solution to pH 8 to produce 4-vinylphenol.\nFor the preparation of MIP by the covalent imprinting method, the prepared cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate (0.62 g) was mixed with EGDMA (4.38 g), AIBN (74.5 mg) in the solvent hexane and allowed bulk polymerization at 65 \u00b0C in the water bath for 24 h. The resultant polymer was dried and ground and sieved. Powders with a size ranging from 25 to 44 \u03bcm were collected for batch adsorption and packing chromatographic columns. To remove the template molecule, polymer particles were suspended and refluxed with NaOH in methanol. After reflux for 6 h, carbon dioxide was passed into the suspension to reduce the pH to 7. The particles were then extensively washed with water and methanol until no more cholesterol was released.\nThe MIP stationary phase was prepared by the method of bulk polymerization at low temperature. Methacrylic acid and 4-vinylpyridine were, respectively, used as the functional monomer to prepare the MIP by the non-covalent imprinting method. Briefly, cholesterol (0.387 g), methacrylic acid (0.682 ml), EGDMA (4.72 ml), and AIBN (0.05 g) were dissolved in 7.5 ml of chloroform in a conical Erlenmeyer flask. After degassing and nitrogen purging, the flask was sealed and allowed to polymerize at 4 \u00b0C for 6 h under UV (365 nm, 100 W lamp) irradiation. When 4-vinylpyridine was used as the functional monomer, the recipe was cholesterol (0.387 g), 4-vinylpyridine (0.112 ml), EGDMA (2.52 ml) and AIBN (0.02 g); all were dissolved in 7.5 ml of chloroform. EGDMA was used here as the crosslinking monomer and AIBN as the free radical initiator. After the polymerization, the chloroform was removed and the polymer product was dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the bulk MIPs resulting from two different recipes were separately ground and sieved. For each MIP, the fraction of powders having a particle size ranging from 25 to 44 \u03bcm was collected for packing a chromatographic column. Template molecules were removed from the particles after packing into columns by continuously washing with acetonitrile until a stable baseline was reached.\nCholesterol-imprinted particles were suspended in methanol by sonication and then slurry packed into 25 cm\u00d70.46 cm I.D. stainless-steel columns using an air-driven fluid pump with acetone as the solvent. The backpressure for packing was 300 bar. For the HPLC analysis, a 10-\u03bcl sample solution was injected and eluted isocratically at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min, using a mixture of water and acetonitrile (1:19) as the mobile phase. The temperature was kept at 25 \u00b0C. Measuring the absorbance at 210 nm constantly monitored the effluent solution. Toluene was used as the non-retained component for the determination of the void fraction for each column. Capacity factors (k\u2032) were calculated according to standard chromatographic theory as k\u2032=(t R\u2212t 0)/t 0, where t R is the retention time of cholesterol or \u03b2-estradiol, and the retention time of toluene was used as the retention time of the non-retained component, t 0. The separation factor (\u03b1) was defined as the ratio of capacity factor of cholesterol to that of \u03b2-estradiol. The plate number was calculated based on the formula: N=5.54(t R/W 0.5h)2, where W 0.5h is the peak width at half-height.\nFor the batch adsorption, a specific amount (20 mg) of imprinted polymer particles was incubated with 3 ml of cholesterol solution in glacial acetic acid with different concentrations at 25 \u00b0C for 3 h. The amount of cholesterol adsorbed on the MIPs was estimated by determining the loss of cholesterol in the solution. Adsorption isotherms were obtained by plotting the amount of cholesterol adsorbed onto particles vs. the concentration of cholesterol in the final solution. The concentration of cholesterol was assayed by the method using an o-phthalaldehyde reagent . The o-phthalaldehyde reagent was prepared by dissolving 25 mg of o-phthalaldehyde in 50 ml of glacial acetic acid. A small volume (0.1 ml) of cholesterol sample or each standard prepared by dissolving cholesterol in glacial acetic acid was well mixed with 2 ml of o-phthalaldehyde reagent, and then with 1 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid thoroughly. After 10 min, the absorbance of the color formed was measured against a reagent blank at 550 nm. The calibration curve obtained from a series of standards was used for the determination of cholesterol concentration in the sample.\nAll the prepared MIPs were cross-linked polymers and successfully introduced recognition sites for cholesterol. They were ground into powders and the fraction having a particle size ranging from 25 to 44 \u03bcm was selected for packing of columns. There was apparently no difference among these MIPs using cholesterol as the template (print molecule), all were white powders after grinding. Fig. 1 shows the hypothetical formation of these cholesterol-imprinted polymers resulting from the free-radical polymerization in the bulk mode. After the removal of the template molecules, all the cholesterol-imprinted polymers were able to selectively adsorb cholesterol from the solution. However, the chromatographic behaviors were different using the polymers as stationary phases. Results from the liquid chromatography of cholesterol on imprinted polymers prepared by covalent method using cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate as the covalently template-bound monomer and non-covalent method using either methacrylic acid or 4-vinylpyridine as the functional monomer are shown in Figs. 2\u20135 . Fig. 2 shows typical peak profiles from the chromatographic separation of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol using these MIPs. As shown in Fig. 3 , every component has the same retention time both when eluted in mixture and alone. For either cholesterol or \u03b2-estradiol, the peak area eluted alone was found to be almost double that eluted in mixture, in concordance with the fact that the amount of each component in the mixture sample is half that in the pure sample. Samples with different combinations of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol concentrations in a total of 1 g/l were applied to columns packed with different MIPs. The retention time and capacity factor for each component were collected and plotted in Figs. 4 and 5 . The chromatographic separation using these MIPs was reproducible and each data point reported in these figures was an average taken from 2 to 4 runs for each combination of solute concentrations. Fig. 5 also shows the selectivity of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol resulting from each column. Table 1 summarizes the results of chromatographic separation between cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol using these three types of MIPs.\nFor different combinations of \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol concentrations with a total of 1 g/l, the peak retention times for both compounds were nearly constant, although the peak height and peak area for each compound increased with concentration in the sample. With the change in sample concentration, the plate number also remained unchanged for all these columns packed with different cholesterol-imprinted polymers. As shown in Fig. 4, \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol had the longest retention times in the column packed with 4-vinylpyridine-based non-covalently imprinted polymer and shortest retention times in the column with methacrylic acid-based imprinted polymer. These two compounds had a medium retention but much sharper peaks when they were chromatographized on the covalently imprinted polymer.\nCholesterol is a 27-carbon alcohol and the major sterol in the human and animal body. Cholesterol has a hydroxyl group at C3 position and an eight-carbon branched aliphatic group attached to C17. \u03b2-Estradiol has also a hydroxyl group connected to C3 but differs from cholesterol by substituting the branched aliphatic group at C17 position with a hydroxyl group (17-\u03b2-hydroxyl) and lacking a methyl group at C19 position. Therefore, \u03b2-estradiol could stay in the MIPs column for a longer time than toluene (as a non-retained compound) due to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group on its C3 position and immobilized acid or pyridine group. As shown in Table 1, the interactions of \u03b2-estradiol to carboxylic groups of immobilized methacrylic acid and phenolic groups of the covalently imprinted polymer contributed capacity factors of 1.0 and 1.1, respectively. While the interaction between \u03b2-estradiol and 4-vinylpyridine contributed a capacity factor of 1.4. Since the volume phase ratios for these MIPs columns are unknown, that the latter interaction is stronger than the other two types of weak interactions is possible but could not be asserted. In comparison with cholesterol, the \u03b2-estradiol molecule is smaller and more hydrophilic. Due to this hydrophilic property, the stay of \u03b2-estradiol in those columns could be changed by the composition of mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water. As the water content in the mobile phase increased, the retention of cholesterol did not change too much, but the retention of \u03b2-estradiol increased significantly (data not shown).\nAs shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5, capacity factors for cholesterol from the columns packed with covalently imprinted polymer and 4-vinylpyridine-based non-covalently imprinted polymer, were 3.5 and 4.0, respectively, which were higher than that obtained from the column with methacrylic acid-based non-covalently imprinted polymer (3.1). The average separation factors for resolution of \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol, however, were 3.2, 3.0 and 2.9, respectively, resulting from the columns with MIPs made by covalent and non-covalent imprinting using methacrylic acid and 4-vinylpyridine. These separation factors are all higher and not too much different from each other, suggesting that selection mechanisms involving the binding of \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol to the recognition sites are very similar for these three MIPs. The successful separation is believed to be dependent on the biospecific adsorption of cholesterol to the recognition sites left by the removed templates due to the shape complementary. The reproducibility of column packing was also good. The alternative column packed with MIPs prepared by non-covalent imprinting using either methacrylic acid or 4-vinylpyridine resulted in almost the same peak retention and column efficiency as those in Table 1.\nThe covalent and non-covalent imprinting methods are different from each other in the formation of specific recognition sites in highly cross-linked porous polymers. The covalent imprinting involves the use of covalently template-bound monomer, in this study cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate, which becomes fixed in their spatial arrangement by co-polymerization with crosslinking monomer. In the non-covalent imprinting, molecules of functional monomer assemble around the template (cholesterol) by non-covalent interactions to form the recognition site after co-polymerization with crosslinker. Removal of the template from the crosslinked polymers yields cavities that are shaped complimentary to cholesterol. This could be done by cleavage of covalent bonds and release of carbon dioxides from the polymer prepared by the covalent imprinting. The release of template from the polymers prepared by non-covalent imprinting was simply done by extraction with the solvent. However, the re-adsorption of cholesterol to the imprinted polymers prepared by either covalent or non-covalent imprinting method is always in a non-covalent manner.\nFor the preparation of cholesterol-imprinting polymer by covalent method, cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate should be prepared prior to polymerization. In the present study, this template-containing monomer was prepared by reacting 4-vinylphenol to cholesteryl chloroformate, where 4-vinylphenol was synthesized from p-acetoxystyrene and carbon dioxide under alkaline conditions. A 99.5% yield was obtained with an m.p. of 68.2 \u00b0C for the resultant 4-vinylphenol. This m.p. for 4-vinylphenol is within the range of reported values of 68\u201369 \u00b0C . The yield for cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate synthesis was 47% and the product was a light-khaki-colored solid with an m.p. of 146.3 \u00b0C, which is also within the range of reported values (146\u2013147 \u00b0C) .\nAlthough polymers were all prepared in bulk polymerization with free radicals initiated by an azo-initiator, the polymerization proceeded at different temperatures. For covalent imprinting the template-bound monomer and crosslinker (EGDMA) co-polymerized at 65 \u00b0C. But for non-covalent imprinting, the functional monomer (methacrylic acid or 4-vinylpyridine) and EGDMA were allowed for polymerization at 4 \u00b0C. This low temperature was necessary to maintain the template in the positions by non-covalent interactions during the polymerization. The low temperature polymerization method was previously used to imprint a large range of compounds including chiral molecules .\nA significant advantage of using covalent imprinting was found to be that it resulted in an imprinting polymer with higher chromatographic efficiency as shown in Fig. 2. The average plate number for the elution peak of cholesterol from the column packed with covalently imprinted polymer was determined to be 1240 (Table 1). In comparison with results from columns packed with non-covalently imprinted polymers using MAA and 4-vinylpyridine, 220 and 260, respectively, the plate number is about fivefold larger. A higher plate number represents a better column efficiency. These results suggest that the formation mechanism and the resultant distribution of recognition sites on the imprinted polymers are different between imprinting methods. In the covalent imprinting, the template molecule is covalently bound to the monomer and after polymerization the template occupies exactly the position of the recognition site. Each recognition site formed after the release of template was shown to bind one molecule of cholesterol through hydrogen bonding. As reported in a previous study, the covalently imprinted polymer was shown capable of interacting with cholesterol with a single dissociation . On the contrary, the complexes in the non-covalent imprinting were formed from template and functional monomer in a somewhat loose manner. Cholesterol has only one hydroxyl group that could interact with the functional monomer to form a complex. Since the complexes were formed simply by just mixing these two together and stabilized by weak interactions like hydrogen bonding during the polymerization, the construct of future recognition sites was looser in comparison with covalent imprinting and even contained aggregates of two or more of the template molecules. This resulted in a heterogeneous distribution of recognition sites with respect to the affinity for cholesterol in the imprinted polymer, and finally a peak broadening and tailing when the polymer was used in liquid chromatography. The disadvantage of peak broadening and tailing is usually associated with imprinted polymers in use as the chromatographic supports . Factors claimed to contribute to peak broadening are mass transfer limitations, heterogeneous distribution of sites from high to low affinity for the print molecule, and variable association and dissociation kinetics . This study suggests that the use of covalent imprinting could yield an imprinted polymer having less heterogeneous distribution in recognition sites that led to a higher chromatographic efficiency. The peak broadening could significantly be reduced, as shown in Fig. 2 (peak 1) and Fig. 3. The slight peak broadening and tailing remaining could be due to the fact that MIPs are prepared as bulk polymers, and then ground and sized into irregular particles of 25 to 44 \u03bcm before packing into columns. The higher plate number and conservation in retention as shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the covalently imprinted polymer has potential for quantitative analysis of the print compound.\nAlthough the formation of complexes from template and monomer was different for covalent and non-covalent imprinting, resultant imprinted polymers all had non-covalent recognition sites. However, different immobilized groups on the recognition sites were involved in the adsorption of cholesterol to those polymers. The immobilized group along the recognition sites were inherited from the monomer employed for cholesterol imprinting. After removal of template, the covalently imprinted polymer had phenolic groups that could interact with the hydroxyl groups of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol. The immobilized phenolic groups behaved similar to the carboxylic group in methacrylic acid-based MIP; these two cholesterol-imprinted polymers had the same retention time for toluene (2.5 min at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min). Also, the retention times of \u03b2-estradiol on these two polymers were very close (5.3 and 5.1 min, respectively). The polymer prepared with 4-vinylpyridine however had longer retention times of toluene, \u03b2-estradiol, and cholesterol (Table 1).\nFor the re-adsorption of cholesterol (print molecule) onto the MIPs, the adsorption capacity was found to significantly depend on the use of functional monomer. The binding capacity sometimes represents the density of effective recognition sites on the polymer. Batch adsorption of cholesterol as shown in Fig. 6 revealed that the binding capacity of the methacrylic acid-based polymer was the smallest one among these three MIPs. The equilibrium adsorption data for these cholesterol-imprinted polymers could fit to the Langmuir isotherms with a coefficient of determination (R 2) in the range of 0.870\u20130.887. The best fittings (dashed curve in the linear plot of Fig. 6) yield the maximum binding capacities of 95, 73, and 65 \u03bcmol/g polymer particle, respectively, for cholesterol-imprinted polymers prepared by the methods of covalent and non-covalent imprinting using 4-vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid as the functional monomers. However, as shown in Fig. 6, the data fitted well to the Langmuir\u2013Freundlich (R 2=0.971\u20130.978, solid curves in linear plot) and Freundlich isotherm (R 2=0.967\u20130.978, solid lines in log plot). The good fit of MIPs adsorption to the Langmuir\u2013Freundlich isotherm suggests that a unimodal heterogeneous distribution of binding sites was present in the MIPs . The covalently imprinted polymer was found to have the lowest degree of binding site heterogeneity with the highest heterogeneity index. Since the heterogeneity has been claimed as a main contributor to peak broadening and asymmetry, the MIPs obtained from covalent imprinting led to less peak broadening as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe result obtained in this study is close to that reported by Whitcombe et al. . The covalent cholesterol-imprinted polymer they made has a maximum capacity of 114\u00b16 \u03bcmol/g, for cholesterol binding. In another experiment on the adsorption of 100 mg particles in 10 ml of cholesterol solution (1 g/l), the covalently imprinted polymer prepared in the present study could adsorb 58\u00b19 \u03bcmol/g, while the non-covalently imprinted polymers with 4-vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid as the monomers could adsorb 52\u00b111 and 20\u00b12 \u03bcmol/g of cholesterol, respectively. These results suggest that the adsorption capacity of the MIPs was dependent on the functional monomer used to form a complex with template, and the immobilized group in the polymer along the recognition sites significantly influenced the adsorption of cholesterol. Under the same adsorption conditions, the cholesterol-printed poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) adsorbed 3.92 mg/g (=10.1 \u03bcmol/g) cholesterol . In other similar adsorption experiments, Sreenivasan reported that the MIPs made by using 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and N-vinyl pyrrolidone as the monomer adsorbed 4.86 mg/g (=12.6 \u03bcmol/g) and 3.06 mg/g (=7.9 \u03bcmol/g) cholesterol, respectively .\nIn this study, two different functional monomers were used for forming a template\u2013monomer complex prior to polymerization in the non-covalent imprinting method. Although methacrylic acid is the commonly used monomer for non-covalent imprinting, the use of other electrophilic group-containing monomers like 4-vinylpyridine might be also useful. The low-temperature synthesized polymer using 4-vinylpyridine was a slightly yellow bulk, but it turned to white powders after drying and grinding. After the removal of the template, the bound pyridine on the 4-vinylpyridine-based MIP seemed to have a stronger interaction to hydroxyl groups of sterols, reflecting the increase of capacity factors for \u03b2-estradiol and cholesterol. Also the bound pyridine groups were able to interact with hydrophobic compounds. Toluene thus could stay a longer time in the column under the same mobile phase conditions. However, the separation factors were higher and almost the same for these two non-covalently imprinted columns. This suggests that the selectivity in the chromatography was mainly based on the affinity of shape match to the cavity created by template printing.\nIn this study, we have demonstrated chromatographic behaviors using molecularly imprinted polymers as stationary phases, prepared by different approaches. Three types of cholesterol-imprinted polymers were prepared and, after removal of template, used as the stationary phase for the chromatographic separation of cholesterol from other steroids. One of the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) was obtained by covalent imprinting involving the use of cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate as the covalently template-bound monomer, while the other two MIPs were obtained by non-covalent imprinting method. Although the non-covalent imprinting was much easier to practice, the formation of complex by simply mixing template and monomer in solution prior to polymerization could lead to a higher heterogeneity of recognition sites on the resultant imprinted polymers and result in peak broadening for the cholesterol chromatography. On the contrary, the covalently imprinted polymer resulted in a much higher chromatographic efficiency, which shows potential for quantitative analysis. The adsorption capacity of the MIPs was found to depend on the functional monomer used to form a complex with the template, and the immobilized group in the polymer along the recognition site significantly influenced the adsorption of cholesterol. The MIP prepared by covalent imprinting was found to bind more cholesterol. However, among these imprinted polymers the difference in the selectivity for chromatographic separation of cholesterol and \u03b2-estradiol was insignificant, suggesting that the separation was based on the specific binding of cholesterol to recognition sites. The study also reveals some important properties of MIP when applied for chromatographic separation."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe term \u201codor\u201d refers to biological, physical and psychological effects caused by the interaction between chemical stimulants \u2013 aromas and fragrances \u2013 and olfactive systems of living creatures . The study of the composition of fragrances and aromas (F&A) is relevant in several fields, as follows.\nIn food science, chemicals or their blends associated with odors discerned as desirable or agreeable are related to a multivariate set of sensorial responses know as \u201cflavor\u201d . Flavors are the predominant elements in the perception of food and beverage quality , and, therefore, its acceptance by consumers. Also, \u201coff-flavors\u201d \u2013 connected to volatile substances with unpleasant odors \u2013 may be caused by microbial contamination of foodstuffs . Investigation of these substances can be important in food-safety studies.\nOdor can be a significant environmental parameter in some situations, since it can be related to the human perception of comfort and to the sanitary conditions of an indoor atmosphere , to the contamination of air resulting from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as to the quality of natural and treated water .\nChemical characterization of fragrances released by vegetables and animals is important to several branches of industry and science. Natural essential oils from plants are traditional base ingredients for perfumes and related toiletry products. However, the rarity of some plants and the possible dermatotoxic effects caused by some natural products create demand for synthetic alternative mixtures. The design of these \u201csynthetic\u201d essential ingredients depends fundamentally on reliable analytical data on the composition of their natural counterparts . Moreover, knowledge about the composition and emission dynamics of floral scents and similar biogenic mixtures of volatile organic compounds is fundamental in several biological studies because of their many different roles in plant reproductive processes, defense against predators and intra-species communication .\nThe development and application of methodologies for the determination of the chemical composition of aromas and similar mixtures is a challenging task. This is a consequence of some inherent general properties of such samples:\n(a) The concentration of relevant analytes in fragrance samples can be extremely low. For example, the literature values for low-odor threshold concentrations (which can be defined the minimum concentration for an odor-producing substance that has a 50% probability to be perceived as a faint odor by a human subject ) for selected substances important in food, biological and environmental aromas, such as ethyl 4-methyl-4-pentenoate, 2-iodophenol, butyric acid and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, are respectively 0.06 nL/L, 1 \u03bcg/L, 240 nL/L, 0.007 nL/L .\nThe typical perceptible concentration for some odorants can, as shown, be less than 1 ng/L of the substance. As a result, the corresponding analytical procedures must provide extremely high sensitivities, adequate for detection and quantification of these species at such low levels.\n(b) Apart from the typically low concentration of the odor-active analytes, most aromas are extremely complex blends of substances. Kotserides and Baumes reported 48 different organic volatile substances as odorants with impact in Bordeaux wines, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The same complexity can be found in floral scents; Bayrak and Akg\u00fcl identified more than 60 volatile organic compounds in samples of essential oils from Turkish rose (Rosa damascena, Miller).\n(c) For aromas generated by biological sources, such as plants and animals, further analytical difficulties arise from the dynamic nature of such systems. For example, the composition of samples obtained from detached parts of plants may not correspond to the mixture released by undisturbed live organisms ; this creates a demand for methods allowing in-vivo sampling. Also, the fact that production and emission of plant volatiles can be affected or triggered by factors, such as light, environmental temperature, stress and the presence of trace atmospheric pollutants , can introduce further complications.\n(d) Some odorants have limited chemical stability, as a result of photolysis, oxidation and other reactions; e.g., the atmospheric chemical lifetime of monoterpenes under daylight conditions was estimated to range from less than 5 min (\u03b1-terpinene) to 3 hours (\u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene, sabinene) .\nAs a result, chemical characterization of F&A ordinarily demands state-of-art techniques for sampling and sample preparation, analyte separation, detection and quantitation. Usually, the application of an analytical separation technique in the final steps is involved. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and other similar detection schemes, such as infrared absorption spectrometry , are the techniques normally employed for F&A chemical analyses.\nThe coupling of olfactometric detection to gas chromatography (GC-O) is also extremely relevant for qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis of fragrances ; several instrumental and methodological variants of GC-O are described in the literature, such as CHARM-Analysis and aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA) .\nAlong with the chromatographic techniques, the use of \u201celectronic noses\u201d (arrays of electrochemical sensors that generate an electric signal that emulates the expected response from the human olfactory system) has been growing in recent years. The development of these fascinating devices involves the arrival of suitable new materials, such as piezoelectric crystals and synthetic conductive polymers, as well as sophisticated data-processing and chemometric techniques . Their more remarkable features, from the analytical standpoint, are the possibility of fast, direct, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of F&A with limited or no preliminary sample-preparation procedures \u2013 although the low sensitivities provided by the devices presently available still prevent their use in solving most F&A analytical problems.\nApart from applications involving measurement with the above-mentioned electronic noses and similar techniques, adequate isolation and pre-concentration of the odor-active analytes are mandatory and critical steps in the methodologies for chemical characterization of F&A . Several sorbent-extraction approaches \u2013 classical liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) \u2013 have been employed for sample preparation in F&A analyses, as well as dynamic headspace (DHS) and static headspace (SHS) methods and procedures based on analytical distillation. In the following sections, the application of some of these techniques to procedures for chemical characterization of flavors and F&A will be addressed.\nDistillation is usually carried out in two slightly different ways, as follows.\nIn the first, the matrix to be extracted is mixed or suspended with water in a suitable vessel fitted with a condenser and, while the mixture is boiled, a condensate phase is collected (hydrodistillation). After the process, an organic, water-insoluble fraction (for vegetable materials, the essential oil) can be separated from the water.\nIn the second procedure, steam is passed through a vessel containing the matrix-water mixture (steam distillation) to yield a similar condensate.\nSteam-assisted distillation and hydrodistillation are traditional procedures for isolation of volatile aroma-related compounds from odoriferous samples, such as food and detached parts of plants. Being simple and straightforward procedures, they are still extensively applied for F&A characterization either alone or combined with other sample-preparation procedures. For example, Saritas et al. isolated the essential oils from aromatic lichens of various genera (Mnium, Plagiomnium and others) by hydrodistillation of fresh and dried plant parts. Using GC-MS combined with 13C-NMR and other techniques, they were able to identify several volatile terpenoid and aliphatic compounds in these hydrodistillates, including two unreported volatile sesquiterpenes ((+)-10-epi-muurola-4,11-diene and 10,11-dihydro-\u03b1-cuparenone).\nA widespread distillation-based sample-preparation method for chemical analysis of F&A is simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE), also known as the Lickens-Nickerson method. Fig. 1 shows one of the proposed designs for the Lickens-Nickerson SDE apparatus. An amount of the fragrance-generating sample (food, beverage, sliced plant tissue, etc.), along with distilled water for dry samples, is contained in flask 2, and flask 3 receives a suitable volume of an extracting solvent denser than water (dichloromethane, chloroform, etc.). Flasks 2 and 3 are heated; the water and solvent vapors are conducted to the extractor body, where they are allowed to condense over the surface of the cold tube 4. In this operation, aroma analytes are removed from the matrix by the water vapor and transferred to the organic phase when the liquids condense together on the cold tube. Both water and solvent are collected in the extractor body after their condensation and return to the corresponding flasks, allowing continuous reflux. A modified apparatus allows use of solvents lighter than water, such as pentane or ethyl acetate, as extractors. Among others, this device was employed by Schlotzhauer et al. to study insect attractors in the fragrance of flowers from Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Large amounts of linalool and \u03b1-farnesene were found in samples collected during daylight periods. Perp\u00e8te et al. combined LLE and SDE to find the key compound responsible for the unpleasant off-flavor in alcohol-free beers (1-methylpropionaldehyde), which was not previously found in reports using other sample-preparation techniques, such as DHS analysis.\nAtmospheric-pressure distillation-based sample-preparation methods may have some serious disadvantages when applied to F&A characterization, since the temperatures usually necessary for the operation can lead to degradation of some analytes. For example, after studying the aroma from saffron (Crocus sativus L.), Tarantilis and Polissou found that the most important odorant in these samples, safranal, is oxidized during conventional steam distillation, forming artifacts, such as 2,6,6-trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadien-1-carboxylic acid. Other compounds found in these distillates were also determined as artifacts resulting from the thermal degradation and oxidation of carotenoids from the saffron matrix. The same problems can be observed in SDE: Siegmund et al. discovered that 5,6-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-4H-1,3,5-dithiazine, usually pointed to as an important aroma-active compound in cooked and cured meat aromas, is an artifact formed during the distillations performed according the Lickens-Nickerson SDE method.\nVacuum distillation, which can be performed under milder conditions, can overcome these problems and is an alternative to regular distillation methods. Moio et al. combined vacuum distillation and LLE to identify the key odorants from Gorgonzola cheese. After GC-MS and GC-O analysis of the distillates/extracts, 2-nonanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-heptanol, ethyl hexanoate, methylanisole and 2-heptanone were determined to be the most relevant odorants in the aromas of natural and creamy Gorgonzola cheeses.\nAnother interesting application of low-pressure distillation was described by Bouchilloux et al. . Using high-vacuum distillation (temperatures between 35\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C and pressures between 0.5 Pa and 1.5 Pa) and simultaneous derivatization with p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, the authors were able to determine trace levels of some powerful odorous thiols in red wines of Bordeaux. The analytes were identified and quantified in the samples as their volatile organomercury derivatives, in concentrations ranging from 0.25 \u03bcg/L to 10 \u03bcg/L (3-mercapto-2-methylpropanol), 10 ng/L to 5 \u03bcg/L (mercaptohexanol) and 1 ng/L to 200 ng/L (3-mercaptohexyl acetate).\nProcedures based on the manipulation of the headspace (HS) in contact with odorous materials are popular and very suitable for chemical analysis of F&A . Different approaches have been employed, either using direct HS analysis or by collection of the odorants in the HS using sorbent devices or cold traps. These techniques and their applications for the chemical characterization of F&A are discussed in the following paragraphs.\nThe simplest way to assess the chemical composition of an aroma is direct analysis (by GC or another convenient technique) of a portion of the air in contact with the odor source, without any other sample-treatment step. However, since little or no pre-concentration of the analytes is involved and, considering the typical trace or ultratrace levels of the components, it is not usually feasible to apply SHS to chemical-fragrance analysis . For example, of 118 references indexed in an extensive literature review on HS analysis of floral fragrances , only nine employed SHS as the sampling or sample-preparation procedure. Nonetheless, when techniques and devices with adequate detection limits are available, and depending on the concentration of the analytes, SHS can be particularly suitable because of its inherent simplicity. For example, Clarkson and Cooke employed GC-MS and GC-AED (atomic emission detection) systems equipped with high-volume injection ports to analyze aroma compounds in the HS of commercial cigarettes. Injecting 1 mL of the HS air in contact with the samples, the authors pointed out that, for these samples, both analysis time and detection limits were better than those obtained using a commercial DHS analyzer.\nA large number of reports describing the use of DHS methods can be found in the literature regarding the chemical characterization of F&A. Because of the constant depletion of the analytes from the sample or from the adjacent atmosphere, the general approach on DHS potentially provides improved analytical sensitivity when compared to SHS and other equilibrium extraction procedures . Desorption of trapped analytes for subsequent analysis can be performed either with small volumes of adequate solvents or using on-line automated thermal desorption (ATD) devices , the later being eminently suitable for routine procedures.\nExperimental set-ups such as that depicted in Fig. 2 can be used, either in the laboratory or under field conditions, to collect fragrance compounds emitted by live plants in dynamic conditions. A vase containing a live plant or some parts of it can be isolated from the environment by a glass bell or similar device. A controlled flow of purified air is passed through the chamber, carrying the aroma compounds to a tube containing a sorbent or to a cold tube, where the volatiles are accumulated for further desorption and analysis. Using a similar apparatus with polyvinyl-acetate bags as the isolating device instead of the glass bell to emulate the usual procedure employed in field sampling of floral scents, Raguso and Pellmyr performed an extensive study of the methodological aspects of sampling and pre-concentration of floral fragrances by DHS with solvent desorption and chromatographic analysis. Live flowers of Clarkia breweri were used as fragrance source, as well as synthetic mixtures of typical flower odorants. It was found that Porapak Q was more efficient than Tenax TA or Tenax TA/charcoal mixtures as sorbent for the evaluated fragrances. However, the relative abundance of the detected compounds \u2013 a useful parameter in biochemical and ecochemical studies \u2013 did not depend on the composition of the sorbent. The trapped compounds were desorbed using either diethyl ether, dichloromethane or hexane; the last solvent provided better recoveries. In the range studied (0.5\u20131.0 L/min), the effect of the stripping air-flow rate on the recovery of the trapped analytes generally was not significant when compared to the effects of other sources of variation on the results between experiments, such as variation in the composition of the volatile emissions between different specimens of the same plant.\nAlthough it can require more complex and expensive hardware (prices up to US$ 15,000) and cannot be applied to fragrances containing temperature-sensitive compounds, DHS with TD (DHS-TD) has several advantages over solvent desorption: simpler procedure; improved detection limits; and; no interference of solvent peaks in the chromatograms. Ageloupoulos et al. monitored the temporal emission pattern of the volatile compounds (unsaturated C6-alyphatic alcohols and aldehydes) released by single intact and damaged leaves of potato (Solanum tuberosum) and broad bean (Vicia faba) by DHS (using a specially designed sampling chamber) coupled to GC-MS. The volatiles were trapped in Tenax TA cartridges and desorbed either thermally (inserting the cartridges inside the programmed-temperature injector of the GC-MS system) or by a solvent (diethyl ether). It was determined that TD, which provided better detectability and therefore required reduced sampling times, allowed the time-emission profiles to be assessed for the monitored compounds. Vercammen et al. also employed a commercial on-line ATD apparatus coupled to a GC-MS to compare sorption tubes packed with Tenax TA and with pure grinded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as well as SHS SPME, for DHS collection of fragrance compounds released by live roses and jasmine. PDMS was found to be more efficient for the isolation of volatile odorants released by these plants, resulting also in cleaner chromatograms.\nAnalytical methodologies involving DHS-TD for characterization of the aroma of foods and beverages are also common. To study the release of volatile flavor compounds by leaves of Japanese pepper (Xanthoxylum piperitum), a spice employed in traditional oriental cuisine, Jiang and Kubota collected the volatiles in the HS of crushed, mechanically disturbed or intact leaves in Tenax TA cartridges. The analytes were thermally desorbed in the injector port of a GC-MS, where they were cryofocused, separated, detected and quantified (Fig. 3 ). It was determined that the number of detected volatile compounds increased from 12 (from intact leaves) to 22 (mechanically disturbed leaves) and then to 36 (crushed leaves). For the disturbed leaves, it was found that the main compounds responsible for the characteristic aroma were limonene (0.56 \u03bcg/g) and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (0.63 \u03bcg/g). For crushed leaves, higher concentrations of C6-aldehydes, especially (Z)-3-hexenal (17.88 \u03bcg/g), and hexanal (6.77 \u03bcg/g), imparted an undesirable grassy odor to the samples.\nIntroduction of artifacts produced by degradation of the sorbent can be a major difficulty in DHS-TD; e.g., Canac-Arteaga et al. found that the interaction of water vapor, volatile compounds and the trapping material (Tenax TA) can produce artifacts during the analysis of aromas of dehydrated cheese and Parmesan cheese. Retention of water by the trapping material can also be a potential problem, especially when it is necessary to cryofocus the analytes in the chromatographic column before separation (moisture can freeze and clog the column). Carbon molecular sieves (Carbosieve, Carboxen) can retain large amounts of water, as opposed to non-polar polymeric sorbents, such as Tenax and graphitized carbon blacks. Polar polymers, such as Porapak T and N, can also hold appreciable amounts of water, which can, however, be easily removed prior to analyte desorption by a current of dry air .\nIntroduction of products from the thermal degradation of adsorptive materials can be avoided in DHS procedures by using cryotrapping. Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd and Valterov\u00e1 determined the emission profile of compounds related to the putrid fragrance from Hydrosme rivieri flowers during their flowering period. A single, live specimen was enclosed in a glass cylinder, which was purged by 15 mL/min of pure air. The compounds released were trapped in a U-shaped tube containing methanol at \u221278\u00b0C. It was found that emission of dimethyl di- and tri-sulphides started after 70 h of flower enclosure, peaking at 118 h and ending after 142 h (Fig. 4 ). Before 70 h of enclosure, only n-alkanes were detected. To eliminate water co-volatilized with the analytes, Kolb et al. proposed modification of a commercial on-line DHS-cryotrapping device by incorporating a water trap (glass-lined steel tube packed with 65% LiCl on Chromosorb W/AW). The authors reported good results in the application of this technique to several processes, including the characterization of aroma from ground coffee.\nSPME, a fast, simple and convenient sample preparation method introduced in 1990 , has gained increasing popularity for F&A analysis, especially as an alternative to DHS methods. It is specially suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of fragrance compounds released by odorous samples, only requiring exposure of a fiber to the HS above the sample for a suitable period of time, followed by direct TD on the heated injection port of a GC . For these reasons, HS-SPME is being presently considered as the best available choice for sample preparation in fragrance and F&A analysis .\nBecause of the small dimensions of the sampling device and the simplicity and speed of the extraction procedure, HS-SPME is able to collect fragrances from live plants with minimum disturbance of the specimen, under both laboratory and field conditions. Vereen et al. employed HS-SPME and GC-MS to study volatile compounds released by intact and mechanically damaged leaves of Fraser firs (Abies fraseri) in the field. Branches of fir were enclosed in 100 mL Tedlar bags and the air inside was extracted with 100 \u03bcm PDMS fibers over periods of up to 4 h. After 5 min of extraction, monoterpenes such as 3-carene predominate; after 3 h, the major component in the chromatograms is bornyl acetate, with minor amounts of heavier compounds (e.g., camphor and borneol). Two species (\u03b2-phellandrene and \u03b3-terpinene), detected in the fragrance exhaled from damaged leaves, were assigned as wound-response compounds. However, inadequate precision (RSD >20%) and slow equilibration times for heavier compounds prevented quantitative application of HS-SPME to these samples.\nZini et al. employed HS-SPME and GC-ITMS (ion trap mass spectrometry) to assess the emission profiles from intact and mechanically damaged leaves of living Eucalyptus citriodora trees, using the sampling chamber shown in Fig. 5 and extractions with PDMS/DVB fibers performed every 30 min for continuous periods of between 8 h and 10 h. The main compounds identified were isoprene, citronellal, citronellol and \u03b2-caryophyllene. Different patterns of dependence between extracted amounts and leaf-enclosure times were observed; e.g., for rose oxide (cis-4-methyl-2-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)-tetrahydropyran), a maximum in the area versus time curves appears after 300-400 min of leaf enclosure, while, for citronellal, the peak areas decayed exponentially from the start of the experiments.\nHS-SPME also has been extensively employed in recent applications related to food flavors. Roberts et al. studied methodological and operational aspects of the application of HS-SPME to analysis of volatile flavor compounds. For coffee aroma, the best sensitivity overall was achieved using fibers coated with 65 \u03bcm PDMS-DVB; this fiber was also found to be the most adequate for heavier polar odorants, such as vanillin. Carbowax-DVB fibers were found to be suitable for organic acids. Non-polar odorants were detectable at the \u03bcg/L level, while polar compounds could generally be detected at the mg/L level only; e.g., in the extraction of coffee aroma with PDMS-DVB fiber for 5 min followed by GC-MS analysis, they found 7.7 mg/L vanillin, 116 mg/L furaneol, 2.3 mg/L ethylguaiacol, 5.7 mg/L guaiacol, 40 mg/L 4-vinylguaiacol, 0.2 mg/L\u03b2-damascenone, 0.4 mg/L 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine and 1 mg/L 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine.\nIn a similar study conducted by Augusto et al. , different SPME fibers were compared for the characterization of the aromas of industrialized pulps of Brazilian tropical fruits \u2013 cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum, Spreng.), caj\u00e1 (Spondias lutea, L.), siriguela (Spondias purpurea, L.) and graviola (Anona reticulata, L). The best efficiencies overall for these aromas were obtained with Carboxen-PDMS fibers, and especially for low-molar mass compounds.\nAnother area where HS-SPME is quickly becoming favored is in studies of the aroma of alcoholic beverages, essential in the assessment of the quality of such products and in optimizing their production. Sala et al. developed a HS-SPME methodology for determination of the aroma-active heterocycles, 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines, in musts from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes. Levels as low as 0.1 ng/L of the analytes could be detected after extraction of the sample HS with PDMS-DVB fibers and GC-NPD (nitrogen-phosphorous detection) analysis of the extracts. Weber et al. showed that chromatographic profiles of aroma obtained by HS-SPME and GC-MS can be useful in classifying samples of wine according to their production area, grape variety and vintage. Nonato et al. compared HS-SPME and conventional LLE in the analysis of secondary aroma compounds (e.g., esters and heavy alcohols) in Brazilian sugar-cane spirits (cacha\u00e7a). The precision in quantifying the target analytes with SPME was better than with the standard LLE procedure.\nOver and above these reports, a new HS-SPME approach for food flavor analysis was recently proposed by P\u00e9r\u00e8s et al. . To characterize the ripening of Camembert cheese, the HS in contact with a 2 g sample contained in 10 mL flasks was exposed for 10 min to a 75 \u03bcm Carboxen-PDMS SPME fiber. In preliminary assays, the extracted materials were analyzed by GC-MS to identify odorant compounds. For subsequent experiments, the extracted compounds were thermally desorbed from the fiber and directly introduced into the ionization chamber of a MS without chromatographic separation. More than 60 compounds were identified in the HS-SPME extract by GC-MS; the Carboxen-PDMS fiber was found to be especially efficient for collecting sulfur compounds (e.g., dimethyl sulfide, methyl thioacetate), which are important impact odorants for this cheese variety. The HS-SPME-MS data obtained without chromatographic separation were statistically processed and found to be valuable for qualitative chemometric classification of the samples.\nMethods involving application of LLE, SPE or SFE directly to the samples to isolate odorants are found occasionally in the recent literature. Although HS-based methods are usually more suitable for fragrance analysis, in some cases, direct extraction of the target analytes from the matrixes is necessary; e.g., species with high odor impact and in extremely reduced concentrations can be important to some F&A, but may not be detected using HS methodologies if their volatility is not high enough to provide a suitable concentration in the sample HS .\nDespite its simplicity, the modern tendency is to replace LLE by other techniques, because high-purity solvents are required for trace analysis and because of the need to reduce the environmental and health risks associated with their manipulation. Also, in the case of biological F&A, LLE cannot be applied to live samples.\nHowever, there are several contemporary reports on use of this technique for F&A analysis, especially for collection of preliminary data .\nL\u00f3pez and G\u00f3mez addressed some operational parameters on the application of LLE to extract aroma compounds from wines. Several solvents \u2013 diethyl ether, n-pentane, Freon-11, n-hexane, 1:1 ether/pentane, 1:1 ether/hexane and dichloromethane \u2013 were compared for extractions of odoriferous terpenic substances from \u201cartificial wine\u201d (12% v/v ethanol in water). It was concluded that dichloromethane and 1:1 ether/pentane are the best solvents for extracting these analytes from wine.\nIn a related study, continuous LLE was employed by Rocha et al. to extract free and releasable odor volatiles from Portuguese Bairrada white grapes employed in the local wine industry. A volume of 250 mL of raw or enzimatically treated must was continuously extracted for 25 h with 75 mL of dichloromethane at 50\u00b0C. The organic phase was dried and concentrated by vacuum distillation prior to the GC-MS analysis. Chemometric analysis of the data allowed differentiation of several grape varieties and of the enzyme treatment studied.\nConventional batch LLE is also still employed occasionally in F&A analysis; recent examples include the identification of odorants in sugar-beet juice .\nSPE can be directly applied to isolate odorants from liquid or liquefiable odoriferous samples, such as beverages, fruit pulps and tissues. A typical contemporary application of SPE to aroma analysis was presented by Wada and Shibamoto , who studied the direct extraction of odorants from Chablis red wine using Porapak Q columns. Samples spiked with selected aroma analytes (2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, diethyl butanedioate and hexanoic, octanoic and decanoic acids) were passed through 30-cm glass columns packed with the sorbent. Diethyl ether, dichloromethane and pentane were evaluated to desorb the extracted materials, which were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Dichloromethane was found to be the best desorbing solvent, recovering up to (103.0\u00b13.7) % of the spiked analytes. Analysis of unspiked samples revealed 67 volatile odor compounds in this variety of red wine.\nSPE has also been applied to characterize butter aroma. Adahchour et al. assessed the use of SPE cartridges packed with different sorbents \u2013 C18, C8, NH2 and CN-bonded silica, as well as SDB-1 (PS-DVB copolymer) \u2013 to extract aroma compounds from this material. Butter samples were melted and the aqueous fraction, after separation of the fat by centrifugation, was passed through the SPE cartridges. The cartridges were eluted by methyl acetate, which was dried and analyzed by GC-MS. Best overall recoveries were obtained with SDB-1 cartridges (average recovery ca. 80%); detection limits for impact odorants, such as vanillin and diacetyl, were in the low-pg range.\nFor samples such as fruit pulps, SPE can be combined with isolation techniques, such as distillation, as exemplified by Boulanger et al. . After distillation of cupuassu pulp and extraction with XAD-2 resin, the main odorants were identified as linalool, \u03b1-terpineol, 2-phenylethanol, myrcene, limonene, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl hexanoate, butyl butanoate, 2,6-dimethyl-oct-7-en-2,6-diol, (E)- and (Z)-2,6-dimethyl-octa-2,7-dien-1,6-diol and methoxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone.\nStanfill and Ashley presented an interesting application of SPE to analysis of flavor-related alkylbenzenes in cigarette smoke. Tobacco from disassembled cigarettes was \u201csmoked\u201d in a smoking machine and the particulate material produced collected with filter pads. The collected particulate was then suspended in hexane and the target analytes extracted from these solutions with CN-silica SPE cartridges. After elution with a hexane/toluene/tetrahydrofuran mixture and concentration of the extract by vacuum evaporation, alkylbenzene odorants were detected and quantified by GC-MS. Detection limits per cigarette ranged from 1.1 ng (methyleugenol) to 27.8 ng (eugenol). This method was tested to quantify aroma alkylbenzenes in commercial brands sold in the USA, and levels of target analytes up to several micrograms per cigarette were found.\nCompared to the direct extraction methods discussed above, SFE presents some advantages for fragrance analysis. For example, since the critical point for CO2 (the most popular and most convenient fluid for SFE) is 31.1\u00b0C at 7.38 MPa, extractions can be carried out under milder temperature conditions and without need of further aggressive procedures, such as distillation of excess solvent, as is common in LLE and SPE .\nVolatile compounds from flowers, leaves and stems of guaca (Spilanthes americana, Mutis \u2013 a South American plant with medicinal and insecticide properties) \u2013 were isolated by Stashenko et al. using both SFE and SDE, and analyzed by GC-MS, GC-FID and GC-NPD. SFE was performed with CO2 at 40\u201345\u00b0C and 7.24\u20137.53 MPa, using up to 30 g of vegetable sample. Extraction time was 2 h and, after depressurization, the collected analytes were dissolved in 2 mL CH2Cl2. Compared to SDE, a larger number of compounds could be detected at levels above 100 ppb in the SFE extracts (e.g., 67 analytes with SFE and 43 analytes with SDE, for floral extractions); the overall extraction yield for SFE was up to twice that for SDE. SFE was found to be especially effective in isolating sesquiterpenes and nitrogenated compounds from these samples.\nThere are also several SFE applications reported for food-flavor analysis. Leunissen et al. developed a SFE-GC-MS method for fast analysis of roasted peanut aroma. For aroma isolation, 2.00\u20132.50 g of ground, roasted peanuts were extracted for 10 min with CO2 at 50\u00b0C and 9.6 MPa. The conditions were adjusted to minimize the extraction of greasy materials. The CO2 was passed through a silica trap at \u22125\u00b0C to collect the extracted materials; the trapped analytes were desorbed by dichloromethane and analyzed by GC-MS. The characteristic aroma compounds were found to be methylpyrrole, hexanol, hexanal, 2-furanmethanol, 2-furancarboxyaldehyde, benzeneacetaldehyde and several alkylpyrazines. Quantification limits for these analytes were estimated to be in the range between 80 ng/g (methylpyrrole) and 0.4 ng/g (ethyl- and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine).\nSupercritical CO2 is a poor extractor for polar substances; therefore, for such analytes, addition of modifiers or use of other fluids, such as supercritical water, is advisable . Kubatova et al. also compared water\u2013SFE and CO2\u2013SFE with hydrodistillation for the separation of aromatic essential oils from savory (Satureja hortensis) and peppermint (Mentha piperita). Extraction of savory with supercritical water for 40 min removed almost 100% more thymol and carvacrol and 150% more borneol and linalool than hydrodistillation. For CO2 extractions, yields of borneol and linalool were similar than those for hydrodistillation; however, for thymol and carvacrol the efficiency of CO2\u2013SFE was only half that of hydrodistillation. Water-SFE was found to be highly selective for polar oxygenated flavor compounds, when compared with CO2\u2013SFE or hydrodistillation.\nAs in any analytical procedure, a suitable choice of sample-preparation technique is essential for accurate, reliable characterization of the chemical composition of F&A. However, because of the peculiarities of these samples \u2013 especially the common presence of thermally or chemically labile analytes in trace or ultratrace concentrations \u2013 selection of the analyte-isolation and pre-concentration technique, as well as careful optimization of the corresponding operational parameters, are of paramount importance.\nSome of the general techniques discussed in the previous sections \u2013 namely distillation procedures, LLE and SPE \u2013 are still employed occasionally for F&A analysis. However, for more critical analysis at least, the present tendency is to replace them with methodologies that are simultaneously less aggressive to analytes and capable of dealing with ultra-low concentrations of analytes in samples. Most of the state-of-the-art, contemporary applications in F&A analytical chemistry are focused on several variations of DHS sampling or, more recently, on HS-SPME. Despite the fact that these techniques have drawbacks (e.g., expensive hardware for DHS-ATD, limitations on the extracted masses for HS-SPME), for nearly all cases in F&A analytical chemistry, either DHS or HS-SPME can obtain dependable results.\nPerhaps the next frontier to be breached in this area will be field sampling and analysis. The great majority of analytical work on plant fragrances is still performed, totally or in part, in the laboratory and/or under in-vitro conditions (i.e., using detached parts of the plants as the source of fragrance). Nonetheless, adequate, realistic characterization of the composition of organic volatile emissions from plants can be made only in their natural habitats, and with minimal biological, chemical and physical disturbance. There is therefore a need for portable or semi-portable instruments (such as GC-MS) and sampling procedures based on small, rugged hardware. For sample preparation, SPME seems to be the technique that most closely fits these demands.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

In food science, it's about understanding the composition of flavors, which are agreeable or desirable substances related to the perception of food and beverage quality. In environmental science and biological science, odor can be a significant environmental parameter, related to human perception of comfort and to the sanitary conditions of an indoor atmosphere. In these fields, the study of fragrances and aromas can be important in monitoring air pollution, understanding plant reproduction processes, and detecting predators.\n\nQ2: What are some of the challenges in chemical characterization of fragrances? \nA2: The characterization of fragrances and aromas presents several challenges. One of the main difficulties is the extremely low concentration of the odor-active analytes in these samples. Therefore, analytical procedures must provide extremely high sensitivities, adequate for detection and quantitation of these species at such low levels. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of these systems; for samples generated by biological sources, the composition can change over time or in response to environmental factors, which can introduce further complications.\n\nQ3: What role does gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) play in the analysis of fragrances?\nA3: Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is a technique used for the chemical analysis of fragrances. It is a common and effective method for the separation, detection, and quantitation of individual components of complex mixtures such as fragrances. \n\nQ4: What is simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) and how is it performed?\nA4: Simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) is a method used for sample preparation in chemical analyses. In this process, a matrix to be extracted is mixed or suspended with water in a suitable vessel, and the mixture is boiled. As the mixture is boiled, a condensate phase is collected, which can then be separated and analyzed. \n\nQ5: What are some of the drawbacks of traditional distillation-based methods? \nA5: Traditional distillation-based methods, such as hydrodistillation and steam distillation, can have temperature requirements that lead to degradation of some analytes. For example, after studying the aroma from saffron, it was found that the most important odorant in these samples, safranal, is oxidized during conventional steam distillation, forming artifacts. \n\nQ6: What is vacuum distillation and how is it performed?\nA6: Vacuum distillation is a method that can overcome some of the problems of regular distillation methods. In this process, steam is passed through a vessel containing the matrix-water mixture under vacuum conditions, which yields a similar condensate. \n\nQ7: What are some of the applications of headspace analysis in the chemical characterization of fragrances? \nA7: Headspace (HS) analysis is a method that involves the collection of volatile aroma-related compounds from odoriferous samples, such as food and detached parts of plants, directly into a chromatographic system without any preliminary sample-preparation procedures. It's a simple and suitable method for the chemical analysis of fragrances. \n\nQ8: What are some of the drawbacks of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and why is it rarely used in fragrance analysis? \nA8: Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) is a technique where a solvent is used to extract analytes from a matrix. However, in fragrance analysis, LLE is rarely used because it requires high-purity solvents for trace analysis and there are environmental and health risks associated with its manipulation. Also, in the case of biological fragrance analysis, LLE cannot be applied to live samples.\n\nQ9: What is solid-phase extraction (SPE) and how is it used in aroma analysis? \nA9: Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is a method where the analytes are adsorbed onto a solid sorbent and then desorbed for subsequent analysis. In aroma analysis, SPE is used to isolate odorants from liquid or liquefiable odoriferous samples, such as beverages, fruit pulps and tissues. \n\nQ10: What are the advantages of using headspace-based methods for fragrance analysis? \nA10: Headspace-based methods are generally more suitable for fragrance analysis because they allow the analysis of samples in their native environment, without manipulation of the sample matrix. They also tend to be less aggressive to analytes and can deal with ultra-low concentrations of analytes, making them suitable for delicate fragrance compounds. Examples of headspace-based methods include dynamic headspace (DHS) and static headspace (SHS) methods and procedures based on analytical distillation.",

        "txt": "The term \u201codor\u201d refers to biological, physical and psychological effects caused by the interaction between chemical stimulants \u2013 aromas and fragrances \u2013 and olfactive systems of living creatures . The study of the composition of fragrances and aromas (F&A) is relevant in several fields, as follows.\nIn food science, chemicals or their blends associated with odors discerned as desirable or agreeable are related to a multivariate set of sensorial responses know as \u201cflavor\u201d . Flavors are the predominant elements in the perception of food and beverage quality , and, therefore, its acceptance by consumers. Also, \u201coff-flavors\u201d \u2013 connected to volatile substances with unpleasant odors \u2013 may be caused by microbial contamination of foodstuffs . Investigation of these substances can be important in food-safety studies.\nOdor can be a significant environmental parameter in some situations, since it can be related to the human perception of comfort and to the sanitary conditions of an indoor atmosphere , to the contamination of air resulting from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as to the quality of natural and treated water .\nChemical characterization of fragrances released by vegetables and animals is important to several branches of industry and science. Natural essential oils from plants are traditional base ingredients for perfumes and related toiletry products. However, the rarity of some plants and the possible dermatotoxic effects caused by some natural products create demand for synthetic alternative mixtures. The design of these \u201csynthetic\u201d essential ingredients depends fundamentally on reliable analytical data on the composition of their natural counterparts . Moreover, knowledge about the composition and emission dynamics of floral scents and similar biogenic mixtures of volatile organic compounds is fundamental in several biological studies because of their many different roles in plant reproductive processes, defense against predators and intra-species communication .\nThe development and application of methodologies for the determination of the chemical composition of aromas and similar mixtures is a challenging task. This is a consequence of some inherent general properties of such samples:\n(a) The concentration of relevant analytes in fragrance samples can be extremely low. For example, the literature values for low-odor threshold concentrations (which can be defined the minimum concentration for an odor-producing substance that has a 50% probability to be perceived as a faint odor by a human subject ) for selected substances important in food, biological and environmental aromas, such as ethyl 4-methyl-4-pentenoate, 2-iodophenol, butyric acid and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, are respectively 0.06 nL/L, 1 \u03bcg/L, 240 nL/L, 0.007 nL/L .\nThe typical perceptible concentration for some odorants can, as shown, be less than 1 ng/L of the substance. As a result, the corresponding analytical procedures must provide extremely high sensitivities, adequate for detection and quantification of these species at such low levels.\n(b) Apart from the typically low concentration of the odor-active analytes, most aromas are extremely complex blends of substances. Kotserides and Baumes reported 48 different organic volatile substances as odorants with impact in Bordeaux wines, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The same complexity can be found in floral scents; Bayrak and Akg\u00fcl identified more than 60 volatile organic compounds in samples of essential oils from Turkish rose (Rosa damascena, Miller).\n(c) For aromas generated by biological sources, such as plants and animals, further analytical difficulties arise from the dynamic nature of such systems. For example, the composition of samples obtained from detached parts of plants may not correspond to the mixture released by undisturbed live organisms ; this creates a demand for methods allowing in-vivo sampling. Also, the fact that production and emission of plant volatiles can be affected or triggered by factors, such as light, environmental temperature, stress and the presence of trace atmospheric pollutants , can introduce further complications.\n(d) Some odorants have limited chemical stability, as a result of photolysis, oxidation and other reactions; e.g., the atmospheric chemical lifetime of monoterpenes under daylight conditions was estimated to range from less than 5 min (\u03b1-terpinene) to 3 hours (\u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene, sabinene) .\nAs a result, chemical characterization of F&A ordinarily demands state-of-art techniques for sampling and sample preparation, analyte separation, detection and quantitation. Usually, the application of an analytical separation technique in the final steps is involved. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and other similar detection schemes, such as infrared absorption spectrometry , are the techniques normally employed for F&A chemical analyses.\nThe coupling of olfactometric detection to gas chromatography (GC-O) is also extremely relevant for qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis of fragrances ; several instrumental and methodological variants of GC-O are described in the literature, such as CHARM-Analysis and aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA) .\nAlong with the chromatographic techniques, the use of \u201celectronic noses\u201d (arrays of electrochemical sensors that generate an electric signal that emulates the expected response from the human olfactory system) has been growing in recent years. The development of these fascinating devices involves the arrival of suitable new materials, such as piezoelectric crystals and synthetic conductive polymers, as well as sophisticated data-processing and chemometric techniques . Their more remarkable features, from the analytical standpoint, are the possibility of fast, direct, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of F&A with limited or no preliminary sample-preparation procedures \u2013 although the low sensitivities provided by the devices presently available still prevent their use in solving most F&A analytical problems.\nApart from applications involving measurement with the above-mentioned electronic noses and similar techniques, adequate isolation and pre-concentration of the odor-active analytes are mandatory and critical steps in the methodologies for chemical characterization of F&A . Several sorbent-extraction approaches \u2013 classical liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) \u2013 have been employed for sample preparation in F&A analyses, as well as dynamic headspace (DHS) and static headspace (SHS) methods and procedures based on analytical distillation. In the following sections, the application of some of these techniques to procedures for chemical characterization of flavors and F&A will be addressed.\nDistillation is usually carried out in two slightly different ways, as follows.\nIn the first, the matrix to be extracted is mixed or suspended with water in a suitable vessel fitted with a condenser and, while the mixture is boiled, a condensate phase is collected (hydrodistillation). After the process, an organic, water-insoluble fraction (for vegetable materials, the essential oil) can be separated from the water.\nIn the second procedure, steam is passed through a vessel containing the matrix-water mixture (steam distillation) to yield a similar condensate.\nSteam-assisted distillation and hydrodistillation are traditional procedures for isolation of volatile aroma-related compounds from odoriferous samples, such as food and detached parts of plants. Being simple and straightforward procedures, they are still extensively applied for F&A characterization either alone or combined with other sample-preparation procedures. For example, Saritas et al. isolated the essential oils from aromatic lichens of various genera (Mnium, Plagiomnium and others) by hydrodistillation of fresh and dried plant parts. Using GC-MS combined with 13C-NMR and other techniques, they were able to identify several volatile terpenoid and aliphatic compounds in these hydrodistillates, including two unreported volatile sesquiterpenes ((+)-10-epi-muurola-4,11-diene and 10,11-dihydro-\u03b1-cuparenone).\nA widespread distillation-based sample-preparation method for chemical analysis of F&A is simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE), also known as the Lickens-Nickerson method. Fig. 1 shows one of the proposed designs for the Lickens-Nickerson SDE apparatus. An amount of the fragrance-generating sample (food, beverage, sliced plant tissue, etc.), along with distilled water for dry samples, is contained in flask 2, and flask 3 receives a suitable volume of an extracting solvent denser than water (dichloromethane, chloroform, etc.). Flasks 2 and 3 are heated; the water and solvent vapors are conducted to the extractor body, where they are allowed to condense over the surface of the cold tube 4. In this operation, aroma analytes are removed from the matrix by the water vapor and transferred to the organic phase when the liquids condense together on the cold tube. Both water and solvent are collected in the extractor body after their condensation and return to the corresponding flasks, allowing continuous reflux. A modified apparatus allows use of solvents lighter than water, such as pentane or ethyl acetate, as extractors. Among others, this device was employed by Schlotzhauer et al. to study insect attractors in the fragrance of flowers from Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Large amounts of linalool and \u03b1-farnesene were found in samples collected during daylight periods. Perp\u00e8te et al. combined LLE and SDE to find the key compound responsible for the unpleasant off-flavor in alcohol-free beers (1-methylpropionaldehyde), which was not previously found in reports using other sample-preparation techniques, such as DHS analysis.\nAtmospheric-pressure distillation-based sample-preparation methods may have some serious disadvantages when applied to F&A characterization, since the temperatures usually necessary for the operation can lead to degradation of some analytes. For example, after studying the aroma from saffron (Crocus sativus L.), Tarantilis and Polissou found that the most important odorant in these samples, safranal, is oxidized during conventional steam distillation, forming artifacts, such as 2,6,6-trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadien-1-carboxylic acid. Other compounds found in these distillates were also determined as artifacts resulting from the thermal degradation and oxidation of carotenoids from the saffron matrix. The same problems can be observed in SDE: Siegmund et al. discovered that 5,6-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-4H-1,3,5-dithiazine, usually pointed to as an important aroma-active compound in cooked and cured meat aromas, is an artifact formed during the distillations performed according the Lickens-Nickerson SDE method.\nVacuum distillation, which can be performed under milder conditions, can overcome these problems and is an alternative to regular distillation methods. Moio et al. combined vacuum distillation and LLE to identify the key odorants from Gorgonzola cheese. After GC-MS and GC-O analysis of the distillates/extracts, 2-nonanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-heptanol, ethyl hexanoate, methylanisole and 2-heptanone were determined to be the most relevant odorants in the aromas of natural and creamy Gorgonzola cheeses.\nAnother interesting application of low-pressure distillation was described by Bouchilloux et al. . Using high-vacuum distillation (temperatures between 35\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C and pressures between 0.5 Pa and 1.5 Pa) and simultaneous derivatization with p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, the authors were able to determine trace levels of some powerful odorous thiols in red wines of Bordeaux. The analytes were identified and quantified in the samples as their volatile organomercury derivatives, in concentrations ranging from 0.25 \u03bcg/L to 10 \u03bcg/L (3-mercapto-2-methylpropanol), 10 ng/L to 5 \u03bcg/L (mercaptohexanol) and 1 ng/L to 200 ng/L (3-mercaptohexyl acetate).\nProcedures based on the manipulation of the headspace (HS) in contact with odorous materials are popular and very suitable for chemical analysis of F&A . Different approaches have been employed, either using direct HS analysis or by collection of the odorants in the HS using sorbent devices or cold traps. These techniques and their applications for the chemical characterization of F&A are discussed in the following paragraphs.\nThe simplest way to assess the chemical composition of an aroma is direct analysis (by GC or another convenient technique) of a portion of the air in contact with the odor source, without any other sample-treatment step. However, since little or no pre-concentration of the analytes is involved and, considering the typical trace or ultratrace levels of the components, it is not usually feasible to apply SHS to chemical-fragrance analysis . For example, of 118 references indexed in an extensive literature review on HS analysis of floral fragrances , only nine employed SHS as the sampling or sample-preparation procedure. Nonetheless, when techniques and devices with adequate detection limits are available, and depending on the concentration of the analytes, SHS can be particularly suitable because of its inherent simplicity. For example, Clarkson and Cooke employed GC-MS and GC-AED (atomic emission detection) systems equipped with high-volume injection ports to analyze aroma compounds in the HS of commercial cigarettes. Injecting 1 mL of the HS air in contact with the samples, the authors pointed out that, for these samples, both analysis time and detection limits were better than those obtained using a commercial DHS analyzer.\nA large number of reports describing the use of DHS methods can be found in the literature regarding the chemical characterization of F&A. Because of the constant depletion of the analytes from the sample or from the adjacent atmosphere, the general approach on DHS potentially provides improved analytical sensitivity when compared to SHS and other equilibrium extraction procedures . Desorption of trapped analytes for subsequent analysis can be performed either with small volumes of adequate solvents or using on-line automated thermal desorption (ATD) devices , the later being eminently suitable for routine procedures.\nExperimental set-ups such as that depicted in Fig. 2 can be used, either in the laboratory or under field conditions, to collect fragrance compounds emitted by live plants in dynamic conditions. A vase containing a live plant or some parts of it can be isolated from the environment by a glass bell or similar device. A controlled flow of purified air is passed through the chamber, carrying the aroma compounds to a tube containing a sorbent or to a cold tube, where the volatiles are accumulated for further desorption and analysis. Using a similar apparatus with polyvinyl-acetate bags as the isolating device instead of the glass bell to emulate the usual procedure employed in field sampling of floral scents, Raguso and Pellmyr performed an extensive study of the methodological aspects of sampling and pre-concentration of floral fragrances by DHS with solvent desorption and chromatographic analysis. Live flowers of Clarkia breweri were used as fragrance source, as well as synthetic mixtures of typical flower odorants. It was found that Porapak Q was more efficient than Tenax TA or Tenax TA/charcoal mixtures as sorbent for the evaluated fragrances. However, the relative abundance of the detected compounds \u2013 a useful parameter in biochemical and ecochemical studies \u2013 did not depend on the composition of the sorbent. The trapped compounds were desorbed using either diethyl ether, dichloromethane or hexane; the last solvent provided better recoveries. In the range studied (0.5\u20131.0 L/min), the effect of the stripping air-flow rate on the recovery of the trapped analytes generally was not significant when compared to the effects of other sources of variation on the results between experiments, such as variation in the composition of the volatile emissions between different specimens of the same plant.\nAlthough it can require more complex and expensive hardware (prices up to US$ 15,000) and cannot be applied to fragrances containing temperature-sensitive compounds, DHS with TD (DHS-TD) has several advantages over solvent desorption: simpler procedure; improved detection limits; and; no interference of solvent peaks in the chromatograms. Ageloupoulos et al. monitored the temporal emission pattern of the volatile compounds (unsaturated C6-alyphatic alcohols and aldehydes) released by single intact and damaged leaves of potato (Solanum tuberosum) and broad bean (Vicia faba) by DHS (using a specially designed sampling chamber) coupled to GC-MS. The volatiles were trapped in Tenax TA cartridges and desorbed either thermally (inserting the cartridges inside the programmed-temperature injector of the GC-MS system) or by a solvent (diethyl ether). It was determined that TD, which provided better detectability and therefore required reduced sampling times, allowed the time-emission profiles to be assessed for the monitored compounds. Vercammen et al. also employed a commercial on-line ATD apparatus coupled to a GC-MS to compare sorption tubes packed with Tenax TA and with pure grinded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as well as SHS SPME, for DHS collection of fragrance compounds released by live roses and jasmine. PDMS was found to be more efficient for the isolation of volatile odorants released by these plants, resulting also in cleaner chromatograms.\nAnalytical methodologies involving DHS-TD for characterization of the aroma of foods and beverages are also common. To study the release of volatile flavor compounds by leaves of Japanese pepper (Xanthoxylum piperitum), a spice employed in traditional oriental cuisine, Jiang and Kubota collected the volatiles in the HS of crushed, mechanically disturbed or intact leaves in Tenax TA cartridges. The analytes were thermally desorbed in the injector port of a GC-MS, where they were cryofocused, separated, detected and quantified (Fig. 3 ). It was determined that the number of detected volatile compounds increased from 12 (from intact leaves) to 22 (mechanically disturbed leaves) and then to 36 (crushed leaves). For the disturbed leaves, it was found that the main compounds responsible for the characteristic aroma were limonene (0.56 \u03bcg/g) and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (0.63 \u03bcg/g). For crushed leaves, higher concentrations of C6-aldehydes, especially (Z)-3-hexenal (17.88 \u03bcg/g), and hexanal (6.77 \u03bcg/g), imparted an undesirable grassy odor to the samples.\nIntroduction of artifacts produced by degradation of the sorbent can be a major difficulty in DHS-TD; e.g., Canac-Arteaga et al. found that the interaction of water vapor, volatile compounds and the trapping material (Tenax TA) can produce artifacts during the analysis of aromas of dehydrated cheese and Parmesan cheese. Retention of water by the trapping material can also be a potential problem, especially when it is necessary to cryofocus the analytes in the chromatographic column before separation (moisture can freeze and clog the column). Carbon molecular sieves (Carbosieve, Carboxen) can retain large amounts of water, as opposed to non-polar polymeric sorbents, such as Tenax and graphitized carbon blacks. Polar polymers, such as Porapak T and N, can also hold appreciable amounts of water, which can, however, be easily removed prior to analyte desorption by a current of dry air .\nIntroduction of products from the thermal degradation of adsorptive materials can be avoided in DHS procedures by using cryotrapping. Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd and Valterov\u00e1 determined the emission profile of compounds related to the putrid fragrance from Hydrosme rivieri flowers during their flowering period. A single, live specimen was enclosed in a glass cylinder, which was purged by 15 mL/min of pure air. The compounds released were trapped in a U-shaped tube containing methanol at \u221278\u00b0C. It was found that emission of dimethyl di- and tri-sulphides started after 70 h of flower enclosure, peaking at 118 h and ending after 142 h (Fig. 4 ). Before 70 h of enclosure, only n-alkanes were detected. To eliminate water co-volatilized with the analytes, Kolb et al. proposed modification of a commercial on-line DHS-cryotrapping device by incorporating a water trap (glass-lined steel tube packed with 65% LiCl on Chromosorb W/AW). The authors reported good results in the application of this technique to several processes, including the characterization of aroma from ground coffee.\nSPME, a fast, simple and convenient sample preparation method introduced in 1990 , has gained increasing popularity for F&A analysis, especially as an alternative to DHS methods. It is specially suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of fragrance compounds released by odorous samples, only requiring exposure of a fiber to the HS above the sample for a suitable period of time, followed by direct TD on the heated injection port of a GC . For these reasons, HS-SPME is being presently considered as the best available choice for sample preparation in fragrance and F&A analysis .\nBecause of the small dimensions of the sampling device and the simplicity and speed of the extraction procedure, HS-SPME is able to collect fragrances from live plants with minimum disturbance of the specimen, under both laboratory and field conditions. Vereen et al. employed HS-SPME and GC-MS to study volatile compounds released by intact and mechanically damaged leaves of Fraser firs (Abies fraseri) in the field. Branches of fir were enclosed in 100 mL Tedlar bags and the air inside was extracted with 100 \u03bcm PDMS fibers over periods of up to 4 h. After 5 min of extraction, monoterpenes such as 3-carene predominate; after 3 h, the major component in the chromatograms is bornyl acetate, with minor amounts of heavier compounds (e.g., camphor and borneol). Two species (\u03b2-phellandrene and \u03b3-terpinene), detected in the fragrance exhaled from damaged leaves, were assigned as wound-response compounds. However, inadequate precision (RSD >20%) and slow equilibration times for heavier compounds prevented quantitative application of HS-SPME to these samples.\nZini et al. employed HS-SPME and GC-ITMS (ion trap mass spectrometry) to assess the emission profiles from intact and mechanically damaged leaves of living Eucalyptus citriodora trees, using the sampling chamber shown in Fig. 5 and extractions with PDMS/DVB fibers performed every 30 min for continuous periods of between 8 h and 10 h. The main compounds identified were isoprene, citronellal, citronellol and \u03b2-caryophyllene. Different patterns of dependence between extracted amounts and leaf-enclosure times were observed; e.g., for rose oxide (cis-4-methyl-2-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)-tetrahydropyran), a maximum in the area versus time curves appears after 300-400 min of leaf enclosure, while, for citronellal, the peak areas decayed exponentially from the start of the experiments.\nHS-SPME also has been extensively employed in recent applications related to food flavors. Roberts et al. studied methodological and operational aspects of the application of HS-SPME to analysis of volatile flavor compounds. For coffee aroma, the best sensitivity overall was achieved using fibers coated with 65 \u03bcm PDMS-DVB; this fiber was also found to be the most adequate for heavier polar odorants, such as vanillin. Carbowax-DVB fibers were found to be suitable for organic acids. Non-polar odorants were detectable at the \u03bcg/L level, while polar compounds could generally be detected at the mg/L level only; e.g., in the extraction of coffee aroma with PDMS-DVB fiber for 5 min followed by GC-MS analysis, they found 7.7 mg/L vanillin, 116 mg/L furaneol, 2.3 mg/L ethylguaiacol, 5.7 mg/L guaiacol, 40 mg/L 4-vinylguaiacol, 0.2 mg/L\u03b2-damascenone, 0.4 mg/L 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine and 1 mg/L 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine.\nIn a similar study conducted by Augusto et al. , different SPME fibers were compared for the characterization of the aromas of industrialized pulps of Brazilian tropical fruits \u2013 cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum, Spreng.), caj\u00e1 (Spondias lutea, L.), siriguela (Spondias purpurea, L.) and graviola (Anona reticulata, L). The best efficiencies overall for these aromas were obtained with Carboxen-PDMS fibers, and especially for low-molar mass compounds.\nAnother area where HS-SPME is quickly becoming favored is in studies of the aroma of alcoholic beverages, essential in the assessment of the quality of such products and in optimizing their production. Sala et al. developed a HS-SPME methodology for determination of the aroma-active heterocycles, 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines, in musts from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes. Levels as low as 0.1 ng/L of the analytes could be detected after extraction of the sample HS with PDMS-DVB fibers and GC-NPD (nitrogen-phosphorous detection) analysis of the extracts. Weber et al. showed that chromatographic profiles of aroma obtained by HS-SPME and GC-MS can be useful in classifying samples of wine according to their production area, grape variety and vintage. Nonato et al. compared HS-SPME and conventional LLE in the analysis of secondary aroma compounds (e.g., esters and heavy alcohols) in Brazilian sugar-cane spirits (cacha\u00e7a). The precision in quantifying the target analytes with SPME was better than with the standard LLE procedure.\nOver and above these reports, a new HS-SPME approach for food flavor analysis was recently proposed by P\u00e9r\u00e8s et al. . To characterize the ripening of Camembert cheese, the HS in contact with a 2 g sample contained in 10 mL flasks was exposed for 10 min to a 75 \u03bcm Carboxen-PDMS SPME fiber. In preliminary assays, the extracted materials were analyzed by GC-MS to identify odorant compounds. For subsequent experiments, the extracted compounds were thermally desorbed from the fiber and directly introduced into the ionization chamber of a MS without chromatographic separation. More than 60 compounds were identified in the HS-SPME extract by GC-MS; the Carboxen-PDMS fiber was found to be especially efficient for collecting sulfur compounds (e.g., dimethyl sulfide, methyl thioacetate), which are important impact odorants for this cheese variety. The HS-SPME-MS data obtained without chromatographic separation were statistically processed and found to be valuable for qualitative chemometric classification of the samples.\nMethods involving application of LLE, SPE or SFE directly to the samples to isolate odorants are found occasionally in the recent literature. Although HS-based methods are usually more suitable for fragrance analysis, in some cases, direct extraction of the target analytes from the matrixes is necessary; e.g., species with high odor impact and in extremely reduced concentrations can be important to some F&A, but may not be detected using HS methodologies if their volatility is not high enough to provide a suitable concentration in the sample HS .\nDespite its simplicity, the modern tendency is to replace LLE by other techniques, because high-purity solvents are required for trace analysis and because of the need to reduce the environmental and health risks associated with their manipulation. Also, in the case of biological F&A, LLE cannot be applied to live samples.\nHowever, there are several contemporary reports on use of this technique for F&A analysis, especially for collection of preliminary data .\nL\u00f3pez and G\u00f3mez addressed some operational parameters on the application of LLE to extract aroma compounds from wines. Several solvents \u2013 diethyl ether, n-pentane, Freon-11, n-hexane, 1:1 ether/pentane, 1:1 ether/hexane and dichloromethane \u2013 were compared for extractions of odoriferous terpenic substances from \u201cartificial wine\u201d (12% v/v ethanol in water). It was concluded that dichloromethane and 1:1 ether/pentane are the best solvents for extracting these analytes from wine.\nIn a related study, continuous LLE was employed by Rocha et al. to extract free and releasable odor volatiles from Portuguese Bairrada white grapes employed in the local wine industry. A volume of 250 mL of raw or enzimatically treated must was continuously extracted for 25 h with 75 mL of dichloromethane at 50\u00b0C. The organic phase was dried and concentrated by vacuum distillation prior to the GC-MS analysis. Chemometric analysis of the data allowed differentiation of several grape varieties and of the enzyme treatment studied.\nConventional batch LLE is also still employed occasionally in F&A analysis; recent examples include the identification of odorants in sugar-beet juice .\nSPE can be directly applied to isolate odorants from liquid or liquefiable odoriferous samples, such as beverages, fruit pulps and tissues. A typical contemporary application of SPE to aroma analysis was presented by Wada and Shibamoto , who studied the direct extraction of odorants from Chablis red wine using Porapak Q columns. Samples spiked with selected aroma analytes (2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, diethyl butanedioate and hexanoic, octanoic and decanoic acids) were passed through 30-cm glass columns packed with the sorbent. Diethyl ether, dichloromethane and pentane were evaluated to desorb the extracted materials, which were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Dichloromethane was found to be the best desorbing solvent, recovering up to (103.0\u00b13.7) % of the spiked analytes. Analysis of unspiked samples revealed 67 volatile odor compounds in this variety of red wine.\nSPE has also been applied to characterize butter aroma. Adahchour et al. assessed the use of SPE cartridges packed with different sorbents \u2013 C18, C8, NH2 and CN-bonded silica, as well as SDB-1 (PS-DVB copolymer) \u2013 to extract aroma compounds from this material. Butter samples were melted and the aqueous fraction, after separation of the fat by centrifugation, was passed through the SPE cartridges. The cartridges were eluted by methyl acetate, which was dried and analyzed by GC-MS. Best overall recoveries were obtained with SDB-1 cartridges (average recovery ca. 80%); detection limits for impact odorants, such as vanillin and diacetyl, were in the low-pg range.\nFor samples such as fruit pulps, SPE can be combined with isolation techniques, such as distillation, as exemplified by Boulanger et al. . After distillation of cupuassu pulp and extraction with XAD-2 resin, the main odorants were identified as linalool, \u03b1-terpineol, 2-phenylethanol, myrcene, limonene, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl hexanoate, butyl butanoate, 2,6-dimethyl-oct-7-en-2,6-diol, (E)- and (Z)-2,6-dimethyl-octa-2,7-dien-1,6-diol and methoxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone.\nStanfill and Ashley presented an interesting application of SPE to analysis of flavor-related alkylbenzenes in cigarette smoke. Tobacco from disassembled cigarettes was \u201csmoked\u201d in a smoking machine and the particulate material produced collected with filter pads. The collected particulate was then suspended in hexane and the target analytes extracted from these solutions with CN-silica SPE cartridges. After elution with a hexane/toluene/tetrahydrofuran mixture and concentration of the extract by vacuum evaporation, alkylbenzene odorants were detected and quantified by GC-MS. Detection limits per cigarette ranged from 1.1 ng (methyleugenol) to 27.8 ng (eugenol). This method was tested to quantify aroma alkylbenzenes in commercial brands sold in the USA, and levels of target analytes up to several micrograms per cigarette were found.\nCompared to the direct extraction methods discussed above, SFE presents some advantages for fragrance analysis. For example, since the critical point for CO2 (the most popular and most convenient fluid for SFE) is 31.1\u00b0C at 7.38 MPa, extractions can be carried out under milder temperature conditions and without need of further aggressive procedures, such as distillation of excess solvent, as is common in LLE and SPE .\nVolatile compounds from flowers, leaves and stems of guaca (Spilanthes americana, Mutis \u2013 a South American plant with medicinal and insecticide properties) \u2013 were isolated by Stashenko et al. using both SFE and SDE, and analyzed by GC-MS, GC-FID and GC-NPD. SFE was performed with CO2 at 40\u201345\u00b0C and 7.24\u20137.53 MPa, using up to 30 g of vegetable sample. Extraction time was 2 h and, after depressurization, the collected analytes were dissolved in 2 mL CH2Cl2. Compared to SDE, a larger number of compounds could be detected at levels above 100 ppb in the SFE extracts (e.g., 67 analytes with SFE and 43 analytes with SDE, for floral extractions); the overall extraction yield for SFE was up to twice that for SDE. SFE was found to be especially effective in isolating sesquiterpenes and nitrogenated compounds from these samples.\nThere are also several SFE applications reported for food-flavor analysis. Leunissen et al. developed a SFE-GC-MS method for fast analysis of roasted peanut aroma. For aroma isolation, 2.00\u20132.50 g of ground, roasted peanuts were extracted for 10 min with CO2 at 50\u00b0C and 9.6 MPa. The conditions were adjusted to minimize the extraction of greasy materials. The CO2 was passed through a silica trap at \u22125\u00b0C to collect the extracted materials; the trapped analytes were desorbed by dichloromethane and analyzed by GC-MS. The characteristic aroma compounds were found to be methylpyrrole, hexanol, hexanal, 2-furanmethanol, 2-furancarboxyaldehyde, benzeneacetaldehyde and several alkylpyrazines. Quantification limits for these analytes were estimated to be in the range between 80 ng/g (methylpyrrole) and 0.4 ng/g (ethyl- and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine).\nSupercritical CO2 is a poor extractor for polar substances; therefore, for such analytes, addition of modifiers or use of other fluids, such as supercritical water, is advisable . Kubatova et al. also compared water\u2013SFE and CO2\u2013SFE with hydrodistillation for the separation of aromatic essential oils from savory (Satureja hortensis) and peppermint (Mentha piperita). Extraction of savory with supercritical water for 40 min removed almost 100% more thymol and carvacrol and 150% more borneol and linalool than hydrodistillation. For CO2 extractions, yields of borneol and linalool were similar than those for hydrodistillation; however, for thymol and carvacrol the efficiency of CO2\u2013SFE was only half that of hydrodistillation. Water-SFE was found to be highly selective for polar oxygenated flavor compounds, when compared with CO2\u2013SFE or hydrodistillation.\nAs in any analytical procedure, a suitable choice of sample-preparation technique is essential for accurate, reliable characterization of the chemical composition of F&A. However, because of the peculiarities of these samples \u2013 especially the common presence of thermally or chemically labile analytes in trace or ultratrace concentrations \u2013 selection of the analyte-isolation and pre-concentration technique, as well as careful optimization of the corresponding operational parameters, are of paramount importance.\nSome of the general techniques discussed in the previous sections \u2013 namely distillation procedures, LLE and SPE \u2013 are still employed occasionally for F&A analysis. However, for more critical analysis at least, the present tendency is to replace them with methodologies that are simultaneously less aggressive to analytes and capable of dealing with ultra-low concentrations of analytes in samples. Most of the state-of-the-art, contemporary applications in F&A analytical chemistry are focused on several variations of DHS sampling or, more recently, on HS-SPME. Despite the fact that these techniques have drawbacks (e.g., expensive hardware for DHS-ATD, limitations on the extracted masses for HS-SPME), for nearly all cases in F&A analytical chemistry, either DHS or HS-SPME can obtain dependable results.\nPerhaps the next frontier to be breached in this area will be field sampling and analysis. The great majority of analytical work on plant fragrances is still performed, totally or in part, in the laboratory and/or under in-vitro conditions (i.e., using detached parts of the plants as the source of fragrance). Nonetheless, adequate, realistic characterization of the composition of organic volatile emissions from plants can be made only in their natural habitats, and with minimal biological, chemical and physical disturbance. There is therefore a need for portable or semi-portable instruments (such as GC-MS) and sampling procedures based on small, rugged hardware. For sample preparation, SPME seems to be the technique that most closely fits these demands."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nTetracyclines [chlortetracycline (CTC) and oxytetracycline (OTC)], sulfonamides [sulfadiazine (SDZ)] and macrolides [tylosin A (TYL A) and erythromycin (ERY)], represent three groups of antibacterial agents that are widely used in Denmark in concentrated feeding of pigs, calves, poultry etc. for treatment of infectious diseases . Table 1 shows the chemical structures and lists selected physico-chemical properties of the compounds. Several antibacterial agents typically used for various treatments of animals during a period of manure storage, can enter the environment simultaneously when liquid manure is applied to agricultural soils. In order to assess the fate of antibacterial agents in the environment, analytical methods that enable the simultaneous analysis of these compounds in manure or soil samples are needed.\nThe requirements for analytical methods are mainly dictated by the environmentally relevant concentrations. The concentration level of antibacterial agents in organic waste from animal production depends on a number of factors such as agricultural practise, animal species, number of treatment incidences, dose and the choice of antibacterial agent. Tetracyclines have been measured in concentrations ranging from 25\u20131000 \u03bcg l\u22121 swine manure and up to 20 mg kg\u22121 in manure and bedding . Sulfonamide content in manure has been measured up to 20 mg kg\u22121 while the content of macrolides are generally lower, e.g. <110 \u03bcg TYL kg\u22121 manure and 2.5 \u03bcg ERY l\u22121 swine manure . When liquid manure is amended to agricultural soils a considerable dilution of the antibacterial agents is anticipated and the resulting soil concentrations has been estimated to range from 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil to 450\u2013900 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil for tetracyclines , but most environmental samples show lower concentrations, e.g. 4\u20137 \u03bcg CTC kg\u22121 soil and 6\u20137 \u03bcg OTC kg\u22121 soil . The objective of the method development was quantification of selected antibacterial agents in concentrations down to the low \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil level.\nIn this paper, a simple and robust method is proposed for the simultaneous extraction of CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY, together with the degradation products (and impurities) TYL B, TYL C and TYL D, from soil. As shown in Table 1, the three groups of antibacterial agents represent a wide range of different physico-chemical properties and a method capable of simultaneous analysis was a compromise to accommodate different properties. During the method development focus was concentrated on the tetracyclines, as strong sorption of these compounds to soil particles (see Table 1) causes difficulties when extracting the antibacterial agents from soil and manure . Extraction methods for antibacterial agents have been developed for several matrices, e.g. animal food products and environmental water samples , while only few methods have been developed for extraction of the antibacterial agents from soil and manure . These extraction methods utilise a range of different extraction solvents and are generally based on mechanical shaking, ultrasonication or vortex mixing. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE; Dionex trade name ASE for accelerated solvent extraction) is an alternative to these methods, that allows soil extractions to be performed under high pressure (500\u20133000 psi; 1 psi=6894.76 Pa) at elevated temperatures (50\u2013200 \u00b0C) and several cycles of fresh solvent can be applied . PLE has various advantages over other methods such as better reproducibility, reduced use of extraction solvent and reduced time for sample preparation. The most important parameters to optimise when using PLE are extraction time, pressure, temperature and number of solvent cycles, as well as water content of the matrix . Besides the extraction technique, the choice of solvent is a critical parameter in optimising the effectiveness of the method, e.g. polarity of the solvent and pH.\nFor the simultaneous extraction of OTC, CTC, TYL, ERY and SDZ from soil, we applied PLE using a Dionex ASE 200 system. Optimum conditions with regard to extraction solvent and number of extraction cycles were investigated. Soil extraction was followed by pre-concentration and clean-up of the PLE extracts using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method with strong anion exchange (SAX) and hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridges, placed in tandem. For chemical analysis and quantification two different reversed-phase HPLC methods coupled with electrospray ionisation (ESI) MS\u2013MS analysis with MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) detection were employed, based on a method developed by Loke et al. .\nThe soil extraction method was validated by measuring recoveries, linearity, day-to-day variation and limits of detection and quantification, for two different soils representing typical Danish agricultural fields, i.e. a loamy sand soil (Askov) and a sandy soil (Lundgaard). The extraction method was applied to samples taken from the two fields on several occasions during a 155-day period after treatment with antibiotic containing pig manure and to barley plants grown on the two fields.\nThe antibacterial agents used in this study were purchased from the following companies: OTC hydrochloride (95.7%) from Unikem, Copenhagen, Denmark; chlortetracycline hydrochloride (79%), tylosin tartrate (89.8%), erythromycin (>99%) and sulfadiazine sodium salt (>99.0%) all from Sigma Aldrich, Germany. Professor Hoogmartens (Facultait Farmaceutische Wetenschappen, Leuven, Belgium) kindly donated tylosin A (TYL A), tylosin B (TYL B), tylosin C (TYL C) and tylosin D (TYL D). 4-Epi-chlortetracycline hydrochloride (ECTC) (97%) from Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium, was used for identification in chromatograms.\nThe following chemicals were used for the extraction buffer, SPE and HPLC: formic acid (GR for analysis, 98\u2013100%), citric acid monohydrate, sodium acetate anhydrous (GR for analysis) and sodium hydroxide pellets (GR for analysis), all from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Methanol of HPLC grade was obtained from KEBO Lab. (Albertslund, Denmark).\nSamples of soil were collected from the Ap horizon (0\u201320 cm) from two fields at a Danish research station, with well-described soil properties . The two soils are a sandy soil (Lundgaard) and a loamy sand soil (Askov), respectively, representing typical Danish agricultural soils. Important soil properties for the two soils are listed in Table 2 . To achieve homogeneous soil samples, the soils were air dried to moisture content of approximately 5% water and sieved through a 2 mm sieve before further handling. Ottawa sand standard, general-purpose grade (S/0365/63), was purchased from Fisher Scientific UK (Leicestershire, UK).\nThe extraction of antibacterial agents from soil was performed by PLE, using an ASE 200 system from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The system was operated with pressure resistant steel extraction cells with a volume of 33 ml and lined with glass-fibre filters from Dionex (part no. 049458, size 1.983 cm).\nApproximately 10 g soil sample was mixed with 10 g Ottawa sand before added to the extraction cell. The extraction buffer consisted of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and 0.2 M citric acid buffer with pH adjusted to 4.7 with NaOH. The automated PLE program was as follows: Extraction with approximately 30 ml extraction buffer at 1500 psi for 10 min, followed by flushing of the extract into a collection vial. Then static extraction with additionally 30 ml of extraction buffer for 3 min and flushing into the same collection vial. The total final volume of extract was approximately 60 ml (depending on soil moisture and mass). Extractions were performed at room temperature as the tetracyclines are converted to their epi- or anhydroform when heated . Optimum conditions for the PLE method are summarised in Table 3 .\nBetween each run the extraction cells were cleaned by ultra-sonication for 15 min in a mixture of Milli-Q water methanol (50:50, v/v), followed by 15 min ultra-sonication in Milli-Q water.\nClean up and pre-concentration was performed using a combination of SAX cartridges (strong anion exhange, 500 mg sorbent, 6 ml cartridge) purchased from Isolute, IST, Mid Glamorgan, UK and Oasis HLB cartridges [poly(divinylbenzene\u2013co-N-pyrrolidone), 200 mg sorbent, 6 ml cartridge] purchased from Waters, Milford, MA, USA. Cartridges were placed in tandem to simultaneously remove negatively charged humic material (SAX) and retain the antibacterial agents (HLB) . The SAX cartridge was placed on top of the HLB cartridge and both columns were conditioned first with 2 ml methanol and then 2 ml 0.04 M citric acid buffer (pH 4.7). PLE extracts (60 ml) containing approximately 30 ml methanol were diluted with Milli-Q water to a methanol content below 10%. The diluted samples were passed through both SPE-columns at approximately 5 ml min\u22121 and after extraction the columns were washed with 2 ml 0.04 M citric acid buffer (pH 4.7) and 2 ml 0.1 M potassium acetate and dried under vacuum for 15 min. Then the SAX cartridge was removed and the antibacterial agents were eluted from the HLB-sorbent with 2 ml methanol.\nFor samples with expected low levels of antibacterial agents, method sensitivity was improved by combining three PLE extracts prior to pre-concentration and thereby achieving higher concentration in the final extracts.\nExperiments were performed to determine recoveries of the antibacterial agents CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL (A, B, C and D) and ERY for the tandem SPE (SAX+HLB) clean-up step only. Sample matrix was obtained by extracting non-spiked samples from the loamy sand soil (Askov) using the PLE method described in Section 2.3. These PLE extracts were fortified with antibacterial agents at two concentration levels (20 and 100 \u03bcg l\u22121), corresponding to extracts obtained from extraction of soil samples with antibacterial agent contents of approximately 40 and 200 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil, respectively. The fortified samples were diluted to 300 ml with Milli-Q water and passed through the SAX\u2013HLB SPE cartridges as described above.\nAnalysis of the resulting SPE extracts required two slightly different LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods (method I for CTC, OTC and SDZ and method II for TYL and ERY), which mainly differ in the MS settings (Tables 3 and 4 ). For both quantification methods (methods I and II), the analytical system consisted of an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), equipped with a degasser, a cooled autosampler (4 \u00b0C) and a cooled column oven (13 \u00b0C). Mass spectrometry detection was achieved using a Sciex API 3000 triple quadropole detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an ESI source (Turbo Ionspray). Collection and treatment of data were performed using Analyst software (Applied Biosystems) in Windows NT platform-based data processing.\nHPLC separations in both methods I and II were achieved using an Xterra MS-C18 analytical column (100mm\u00d72.1 mm, particle size 3.5 \u03bcm) from Waters and gradient elution. The composition of mobile phases, gradient elution, flow rates and injection volume for methods I and II, respectively, are listed in Table 3. Mobile phases were prepared by mixing methanol and 308 \u03bcl formic acid with Milli-Q water in a 1 l volumetric flask, followed by degassing by ultrasonication for 10 min.\nFor MS detection, the instrument was operated in the positive ion mode and detection of the antibacterial agents was obtained using MRM detection. Precursor mass and product ion mass for the MRM detection are listed in Table 4, together with the MS\u2013MS settings for methods I and II, respectively.\nThe response for each of the antibacterial agents detected in the LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods was evaluated for linearity, and the limits of detection and quantification for the instrument (LODinstrument and LOQinstrument) were determined, using calibration curves for the concentration range 1\u2013500 \u03bcg l\u22121. Stock solutions of the antibacterial agents were prepared in methanol, wrapped in tinfoil and stored at 5 \u00b0C for a maximum of 1 month. From two separate stock solutions duplicate standards were produced in methanol at eight concentration levels (1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 135, 270 and 500 \u03bcg l\u22121) and duplicate calibration curves for CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY were produced, by alternating the number of injections between two and six. To evaluate the method applicability to ECTC and the baseline separation of CTC and ECTC, the procedure was repeated for ECTC.\nLODinstrument and LOQinstrument were determined using the standard deviation of the response (\u03c3) and the slope of the calibration curves (S) : LODinstrument=3.3\u03c3S LOQinstrument=10\u03c3S\nRecoveries for the entire PLE\u2013SPE\u2013LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS procedures were determined for the loamy sand soil (Askov) and the sandy soil (Lundgaard). Soil samples from both soils were fortified with CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL (A, B, C and D) and ERY on four concentration levels (approximately 5, 25, 75 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil) and six replicates at each level. The fortified samples were extracted and analysed using the entire procedure. Recoveries were calculated as the percentage of extracted antibacterial agents compared to spiked level.\nTo compare recoveries obtained when combining three PLE extracts prior to SPE pre-concentration with recoveries obtained when only one PLE-extract were analysed, the recovery experiment for the 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil concentration level were performed using both procedures (six replicates, loamy sand soil only).\nDay-to-day variations for the extraction procedure were determined for the loamy sand soil (Askov), by repeating the recovery experiment for concentration levels 5, 25 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil after 3 days.\nFurthermore, the linearity range for the entire soil extraction procedure (PLE\u2013SPE\u2013LC\u2013MS\u2013MS) and limits of detection (LODsoil) and quantification (LOQsoil) were determined for the antibacterial agents for both soil types. Soil samples were fortified on six concentration levels (1, 5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil) with CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY to produce calibration curves. For the concentration levels 1, 25 and 75 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil, six replicates were produced, while duplicate samples were made for concentration levels 5, 50 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil. LODsoil and LOQsoil were determined using the standard deviation on the response (\u03c3) and the slope of the calibration curves (S) as described in Section 2.5.\nFor TYL B, C and D, LODsoil,estimated and LOQsoil,estimated were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio as S/N=3 and S/N=10, respectively, for soil samples containing 5 \u03bcg kg\u22121 TYL B, C or D.\nThe PLE-method for soil extraction was applied to extraction of antibacterial agents from grains. Ripe grains of spring barley were freeze-dried and ground in an electronic coffee mill to coarse flour. Equivalent to soil samples, 10 g flour was mixed with 10 g Ottawa sand in the PLE-extraction cell and PLE was performed following the procedure described in Section 2.3. The PLE extracts were filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter before combining two extracts and diluting with Milli-Q water to 500 ml. Tandem-SPE (SAX\u2013HLB) were performed equivalent to soil samples (Section 2.4.), but it was necessary to replace the SAX-cartridge for every 200 ml sample due to clogging of the sorbent. Quantification of the SPE-extracts was achieved using the LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods described in Section 2.5.\nRecoveries for the extraction of antibacterial agents from grain were determined for eight replicate flour samples fortified with CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY to a concentration of 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 flour. Limits of detection (LODgrain,estimated) and quantification (LOQgrain,estimated) for the grain extraction were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), as S/N=3 and 10, respectively.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of the soil extraction procedure to real field samples, soil samples were taken from two agricultural fields (loamy sand soil (Askov) and sandy soil (Lundgaard)) on several occasions after manure application in the period May to October 2000. The fields were located within two kilometres of each other, but represent to different soil types (Table 2). Liquid manure was obtained from a piglet-breeding farm where the animals were treated with CTC and TYL A and the content of antibacterial agents in the manure were estimated to be 300\u2013500 mg kg\u22121 dry mass manure, according to information from veterinary reports on treatments within the study period. The manure was applied according to Danish legislation to a level of 100 kg N ha\u22121 per year and ploughed to a depth of 20 cm, and spring barley was grown on the fields.\nDuplicate soil samples were taken from three plots on each field, using a soil auger to a depth of 20 cm. The soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve and the antibacterial agents were extracted and analysed as described in Sections 2.3\u20132.5.\nThe grain extraction method (Section 2.7) was applied to grains of spring barley harvested from plants grown on the agricultural fields (Askov and Lundgaard). The grains were harvested in August 2000 and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Pressurised liquid extraction of the antibacterial agents was performed after grinding of the grain samples, as described in Section 2.7.\nIn development and optimisation of the PLE method several parameters need to be considered such as soil sample size, soil moisture content, extraction solvent polarity and pH, and PLE-settings such as pressure, temperature and number of solvent cycles.\nIn order to obtain the highest possible concentrations of the antibacterial agents in soil extracts, the performance of the PLE-system was investigated for soil samples weighing up to 25 g. However, samples greater than 10 g soil caused clogging of the PLE extraction cell. To increase contact-surface between soil particles and extraction buffer and prevent clogging of the extraction cell, optimum moisture content of approximately 5% was found and 10 g Ottawa sand standard was mixed into 10 g soil sample before extraction.\nExtraction buffer for extracting the antibacterial agents from soil was selected in accordance with the physico-chemical properties of the compounds (Table 1). Many different soil-adsorption mechanisms, such as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, complexation and cation exchange, may affect the extraction of the compounds from soil. This was found particularly important for the tetracyclines as they form strong complexes with di- and trivalent cations in the clay mineral inter-layers or to hydroxy-groups at the surface of the soil particles and therefore a complexation agent was added to the extraction buffer. As a starting point a combination of McIlvaine buffer (citric acid and potassium phosphate), EDTA and methanol was applied as extraction buffer, as previously employed for food analysis and soil extractions . However, this buffer precipitated within few hours, on occasions causing blockage in the tubes and valves of the PLE system. An extraction buffer containing methanol and only citric acid buffer (pH adjusted to 4.7) as complexation agent was therefore assessed for extraction efficiency. Recoveries achieved using this method were above 40%, which were comparable to recoveries for the McIlvaine+EDTA combination (<25\u201370%) and method development continued with the citric acid + methanol combination. At pH 4.7 CTC, OTC and SDZ are overall neutral and therefore have reasonably high affinity for the moderately hydrophobic extraction buffer, while TYL A and ERY are positively charged but due to their hydrophobicity they are extractable using the same buffer (see Table 1 for pK a and log K ow values).\nThe influence of the citric acid concentration in the extraction buffer was investigated by performing the PLE-extraction for the concentration range 0.2\u20130.5 M citric acid adjusted to pH 4.7. No significant difference in recovery was found (ranging from 24\u201333 to 30\u201335%). Correspondingly, the relative content of methanol in the buffer in the range 50\u201375% was tested and a slightly higher recovery was found when using 50% methanol (40\u201343% as compared to 36\u201339% for 75% methanol). Furthermore, increasing the methanol content resulted in increased colouring of the PLE-extract, which required additional sample clean-up. Hence, the buffer composition used in subsequent analysis was 50% methanol and 50% 0.2 M citric acid with pH adjusted to 4.7.\nThe PLE extraction conditions were set to 10 min extraction at 1500 psi at room temperature, followed by another flush of solvent for 3 min. No additional extraction of the antibacterial agents was achieved using a second and third flush. Optimum conditions are listed in Section 2.3 and summarised in Table 3.\nTwo different LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods (methods I and II) were required for the analysis of the antibacterial agents due to differences in physico-chemical properties (Table 1). In Fig. 1 , chromatograms for MRM analysis of soil samples containing 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil of the antibacterial agents show negligible baseline noise when using MRM detection and that only analyte peaks occur in the chromatograms. Epi-chlortetracycline (ECTC) and CTC have the same precursor and product ions masses and therefore occur in the same chromatogram, but the peaks are separated.\nAs shown in Table 5 , the methods were linear in the complete concentration range tested (1 and 500 \u03bcg l\u22121, equivalent to 0.07\u201333 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil) and covers the requirements for most environmental soil samples containing antibacterial agents. The limits of detection (LODinstrument) and quantification (LOQinstrument) are listed in Table 5. These values correspond to soil concentrations of 0.5\u20131.5 and 1.5\u20135 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil, respectively, assuming that 3\u00d710 g soil is extracted and concentrated to 2 ml SPE extract.\nThe combination of the SAX and the HLB (polymeric) SPE sorbents act as both clean-up and pre-concentration. The SAX column reduces matrix interferences by adsorbing anionic humic particles from the soil extracts, avoiding contamination, blocking and overloading of the HLB sorbent. At a buffer pH of 4.7, the antibacterial agents are overall neutral or cations (Table 1) and are therefore not retained on the SAX cartridge, while the polymer based HLB cartridge simultaneously retains neutral polar and non-polar compounds, including the studied antibacterial agents.\nDilution of the PLE extracts with Milli-Q water to a methanol content below 10%, were primarily performed to avoid continuous elution of the antibacterial agents from the HLB sorption material, but additionally the buffer capacity (20 mM citric acid) remained sufficient to keep a sample pH of 4.7 after dilution.\nRecoveries and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the SPE method at two concentration levels (approximately 20 and 100 \u03bcg l\u22121 in the final extract) are listed in Table 6 . The SPE method is optimised for tetracyclines, i.e. sorbent material and sample pH, and recoveries for these compounds (CTC and OTC) are above 80%. The method is also applicable for the macrolides (TYL A and ERY) with recoveries above 80% and for the degradation products, with recoveries of approximately 100% for TYL B and TYL D and approximately 70% for TYL C. The sulfonamides are a more hydrophilic group of antibacterial agents and recoveries of approximately 85% for SDZ were found. SDZ is one of the more hydrophilic sulfonamides (logKow=\u22120.092), but some sulfonamides are even more hydrophilic, i.e. sulfanilamide (SUL, logKow=\u22120.719) .\nMean recoveries and corresponding confidence intervals for the PLE-extraction of six replicate soil samples are listed in Table 7 . Recoveries for all antibacterial agents are satisfactorily high and the standard deviations on six replicate samples are low, as demonstrated by narrow confidence intervals.\nFor the tetracyclines (OTC and CTC) recoveries of approximately 50\u201370% are achieved, which is lower than recoveries obtained for the SPE method, indicating that the compounds are not fully extracted from the soil. This is probably due to the many sorption mechanisms involved in the binding of tetracyclines to soil, resulting in very strong sorption (Table 1). Recoveries for the two soil types are comparable, but with a tendency towards higher recoveries in the sandy soil. This corresponds well with previous studies indicating that tetracyclines primarily sorb to the clay fraction of the soil by complexation and hydrogen bonding . However, almost identical K d values for OTC for the loamy sand and sandy soil have been determined , which may correspond to binding to acid sites in organic fraction in the soil, i.e. humic acid .\nFor the macrolides (TYL A and ERY), the recoveries range from 50 to above 100%, depending on spike concentration and soil type. Recoveries for ERY are highest in the sandy soil, in which the content of clay and organic carbon is lower than the loamy sand soil. This indicates that ERY mainly sorbs to the organic fraction or clay by hydrophobic interactions. Contrary, recoveries for TYL A are higher in the loamy sand soil, which is inconsistent with the partition coefficients determined by , showing much stronger sorption to the loamy sand soil as compared to the sandy soil (Table 1). Possibly the PLE solvent (citricacid+methanol) is not optimal for extracting TYL from soil and higher extraction efficiency may be achieved by using a more hydrophobic solvent. However, for the degradation products TYL B, C, and D, satisfactory recoveries are obtained, indicating that the soil extraction method is also applicable for these compounds.\nFor SDZ recoveries of approximately 80% for the complete soil extraction method are comparable to the recoveries achieved for the SPE method only, indicating that SDZ are fully extracted from the soil using the PLE procedure, but is partly lost during the SPE concentration.\nIt was examined whether comparable results were obtained when combining three PLE extracts prior to the SPE concentration rather than working with only one extract, by performing the recovery experiment for the 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil level using both procedures. No significant deviation between procedures was found, as the 95% confidence intervals for recoveries overlap (Table 7). Furthermore, the calibration curve for the entire soil extraction method (see Section 3.5.) consisted of three points where three extracts were combined (1, 5 and 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121) and three points where only one extract were concentrated (50, 75 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121), and the calibration curves were linear in the complete range (Table 8 ). This also demonstrates that no matrix effect or breakthrough of the SPE cartridges happened when a 1 l sample was extracted.\nDay-to-day variation was investigated for the loamy sand soil and the results are shown in Table 7. Significant day-to-day variation is determined as not-overlapping 95% confidence intervals for recoveries obtained on the same concentration level on different days. For some experiments day-to-day variation is demonstrated even though the recoveries are comparable, which is due to the low standard deviations obtained for six replicate samples and corresponding narrow confidence intervals.\nCalibration curves were produced for the entire soil extraction procedure, by fortifying soil samples from the loamy sand soil and the sandy soil with the antibacterial agents at six concentration levels, Validation results are shown in Table 8. Linear calibration curves were obtained for all compounds and for both soils, with regression coefficients (R 2) in the range of 0.94\u20130.99 and linearity range of approximately 1\u2013100 \u03bcg kg\u22121, which is the complete range tested. For the entire soil extraction method, LODsoil and LOQsoil were estimated from the standard deviation and slope of the calibration curves (Section 2.5). Values obtained for LODsoil and LOQsoil for the antibacterial agents were in the range <1\u20135 and 1\u201310 \u03bcg kg\u22121, respectively, which covers the range expected for environmental soil samples . For the degradation products TYL B, C and D, LODsoil,estimated and LOQsoil,estimated were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and were in the same range as the parent compound, TYL A (Table 8). These levels of quantitation are relatively low and make the analytical method applicable for analysing most environmental soil samples for the studied antibacterial agents.\nThe liquid manure applied to the agricultural fields was obtained from pigs treated with CTC and TYL A and no other antibacterial agents (OTC, ERY or SDZ) were detected in the soil samples. The measured concentrations of CTC and TYL A in the soil samples taken from the two manure-amended fields are shown in Table 9 . The first sample (9 May 2000) was obtained 9 days after manure application and show concentrations of approximately 10\u201315 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil for CTC in both soils and 25\u201355 and 10\u201320 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil for TYL A in the loamy sand and sandy soil, respectively. These concentrations decline continuously during the following 146 days period. Concentrations in samples taken on the last date of sampling (2 October 2000), was below or near the LODsoil for CTC and approximately 15 and 3 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for TYL A for the loamy sand and sandy soil, respectively. Hence, the method is applicable for monitoring of the antibacterial agents levels in field samples over time.\nSome deviation is seen between the concentrations measured on the three different plots on each field at each sampling day. This is probably due to heterogeneous mixing of soil and manure, and it is seen that the deviation declines during the period of sampling. Deviations between measured concentrations in field samples were also demonstrated by Hamscher et al. , who measured high concentrations of CTC in heterogeneously distributed manure aggregates.\nFlour of grinded barley grains was extracted to evaluate whether any detectable uptake of antibacterials agents by barley plants occurred. The PLE extraction procedure was applied with only few modifications, i.e. a filtration step prior to SPE clean-up and replacement of the SAX-cartridge for every 200 ml sample. Recoveries for the grain extraction were determined for spiked grain samples and were 42.3% (34\u201350) for CTC, 31.8% (28\u201336) for OTC, 53.5% (47\u201360) for TYL A, 56.5% (52\u201361) for ERY and 39.9% (38\u201342) for SDZ (95% CI in brackets). These recoveries are equivalent to recoveries obtained for soil extractions and demonstrate that the antibacterial agents are not lost due to the considerable amounts of suspended flour particles in the samples or during filtration.\nLODgrain,estimated and LOQgrain,estimated for the grain extraction were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio for flour samples fortified to 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 of each of the antibacterial agents. Estimated values for LODgrain,estimated were 0.3, 0.4, 1.4, 1.5 and 0.2 \u03bcg kg\u22121 grain for CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY, respectively. Corresponding LOQgrain,estimated values were in the range 0.6\u20135.0 \u03bcg kg\u22121 grain.\nTo test the procedure on real field samples, non-spiked grain samples were harvested from fields amended with liquid manure and extracted using the procedure described in Section 2.7. None of the antibacterial agents were measured in concentration levels above LODgrain,estimated. The grains were harvested in August when the soil content of CTC and TYL A had declined to below 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil (Table 9), so apparently the antibacterial agents have not been taken up by plants and accumulated in the grains in detectable amounts.\nSimultaneous extraction of CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY from soil was obtained using a simple PLE method followed by clean-up and concentration using SPE and analysis by two slightly different LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods (methods I and II). Recoveries and LODsoil and LOQsoil for the extraction procedure were satisfactory, demonstrating that the procedure is applicable for environmental samples.\nWithin each group of antibacterial agents, i.e. tetracyclines, macrolides and sulfonamides, there was some variation between the recoveries achieved for the representatives and interpretation of the applicability of the methods for other compounds in each group is difficult. However, the compounds examined in this study represent a wide range of physico-chemical properties and therefore the method is expected to be applicable to many of the antibacterial agents present simultaneously in manure.\nThe soil extraction procedure was optimised for tetracyclines and higher recoveries could probably be achieved for the macrolides and sulfonamides, if modifying the method with regards to these compounds. However, this procedure represents a useful compromise for simultaneous extraction of all three groups of antibacterial agents from soil.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Tetracyclines [chlortetracycline (CTC) and oxytetracycline (OTC)], sulfonamides [sulfadiazine (SDZ)] and macrolides [tylosin A (TYL A) and erythromycin (ERY)], represent three groups of antibacterial agents that are widely used in Denmark in concentrated feeding of pigs, calves, poultry etc. for treatment of infectious diseases . Table 1 shows the chemical structures and lists selected physico-chemical properties of the compounds. Several antibacterial agents typically used for various treatments of animals during a period of manure storage, can enter the environment simultaneously when liquid manure is applied to agricultural soils. In order to assess the fate of antibacterial agents in the environment, analytical methods that enable the simultaneous analysis of these compounds in manure or soil samples are needed.\nThe requirements for analytical methods are mainly dictated by the environmentally relevant concentrations. The concentration level of antibacterial agents in organic waste from animal production depends on a number of factors such as agricultural practise, animal species, number of treatment incidences, dose and the choice of antibacterial agent. Tetracyclines have been measured in concentrations ranging from 25\u20131000 \u03bcg l\u22121 swine manure and up to 20 mg kg\u22121 in manure and bedding . Sulfonamide content in manure has been measured up to 20 mg kg\u22121 while the content of macrolides are generally lower, e.g. <110 \u03bcg TYL kg\u22121 manure and 2.5 \u03bcg ERY l\u22121 swine manure . When liquid manure is amended to agricultural soils a considerable dilution of the antibacterial agents is anticipated and the resulting soil concentrations has been estimated to range from 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil to 450\u2013900 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil for tetracyclines , but most environmental samples show lower concentrations, e.g. 4\u20137 \u03bcg CTC kg\u22121 soil and 6\u20137 \u03bcg OTC kg\u22121 soil . The objective of the method development was quantification of selected antibacterial agents in concentrations down to the low \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil level.\nIn this paper, a simple and robust method is proposed for the simultaneous extraction of CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY, together with the degradation products (and impurities) TYL B, TYL C and TYL D, from soil. As shown in Table 1, the three groups of antibacterial agents represent a wide range of different physico-chemical properties and a method capable of simultaneous analysis was a compromise to accommodate different properties. During the method development focus was concentrated on the tetracyclines, as strong sorption of these compounds to soil particles (see Table 1) causes difficulties when extracting the antibacterial agents from soil and manure . Extraction methods for antibacterial agents have been developed for several matrices, e.g. animal food products and environmental water samples , while only few methods have been developed for extraction of the antibacterial agents from soil and manure . These extraction methods utilise a range of different extraction solvents and are generally based on mechanical shaking, ultrasonication or vortex mixing. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE; Dionex trade name ASE for accelerated solvent extraction) is an alternative to these methods, that allows soil extractions to be performed under high pressure (500\u20133000 psi; 1 psi=6894.76 Pa) at elevated temperatures (50\u2013200 \u00b0C) and several cycles of fresh solvent can be applied . PLE has various advantages over other methods such as better reproducibility, reduced use of extraction solvent and reduced time for sample preparation. The most important parameters to optimise when using PLE are extraction time, pressure, temperature and number of solvent cycles, as well as water content of the matrix . Besides the extraction technique, the choice of solvent is a critical parameter in optimising the effectiveness of the method, e.g. polarity of the solvent and pH.\nFor the simultaneous extraction of OTC, CTC, TYL, ERY and SDZ from soil, we applied PLE using a Dionex ASE 200 system. Optimum conditions with regard to extraction solvent and number of extraction cycles were investigated. Soil extraction was followed by pre-concentration and clean-up of the PLE extracts using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method with strong anion exchange (SAX) and hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridges, placed in tandem. For chemical analysis and quantification two different reversed-phase HPLC methods coupled with electrospray ionisation (ESI) MS\u2013MS analysis with MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) detection were employed, based on a method developed by Loke et al. .\nThe soil extraction method was validated by measuring recoveries, linearity, day-to-day variation and limits of detection and quantification, for two different soils representing typical Danish agricultural fields, i.e. a loamy sand soil (Askov) and a sandy soil (Lundgaard). The extraction method was applied to samples taken from the two fields on several occasions during a 155-day period after treatment with antibiotic containing pig manure and to barley plants grown on the two fields.\nThe antibacterial agents used in this study were purchased from the following companies: OTC hydrochloride (95.7%) from Unikem, Copenhagen, Denmark; chlortetracycline hydrochloride (79%), tylosin tartrate (89.8%), erythromycin (>99%) and sulfadiazine sodium salt (>99.0%) all from Sigma Aldrich, Germany. Professor Hoogmartens (Facultait Farmaceutische Wetenschappen, Leuven, Belgium) kindly donated tylosin A (TYL A), tylosin B (TYL B), tylosin C (TYL C) and tylosin D (TYL D). 4-Epi-chlortetracycline hydrochloride (ECTC) (97%) from Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium, was used for identification in chromatograms.\nThe following chemicals were used for the extraction buffer, SPE and HPLC: formic acid (GR for analysis, 98\u2013100%), citric acid monohydrate, sodium acetate anhydrous (GR for analysis) and sodium hydroxide pellets (GR for analysis), all from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Methanol of HPLC grade was obtained from KEBO Lab. (Albertslund, Denmark).\nSamples of soil were collected from the Ap horizon (0\u201320 cm) from two fields at a Danish research station, with well-described soil properties . The two soils are a sandy soil (Lundgaard) and a loamy sand soil (Askov), respectively, representing typical Danish agricultural soils. Important soil properties for the two soils are listed in Table 2 . To achieve homogeneous soil samples, the soils were air dried to moisture content of approximately 5% water and sieved through a 2 mm sieve before further handling. Ottawa sand standard, general-purpose grade (S/0365/63), was purchased from Fisher Scientific UK (Leicestershire, UK).\nThe extraction of antibacterial agents from soil was performed by PLE, using an ASE 200 system from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The system was operated with pressure resistant steel extraction cells with a volume of 33 ml and lined with glass-fibre filters from Dionex (part no. 049458, size 1.983 cm).\nApproximately 10 g soil sample was mixed with 10 g Ottawa sand before added to the extraction cell. The extraction buffer consisted of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and 0.2 M citric acid buffer with pH adjusted to 4.7 with NaOH. The automated PLE program was as follows: Extraction with approximately 30 ml extraction buffer at 1500 psi for 10 min, followed by flushing of the extract into a collection vial. Then static extraction with additionally 30 ml of extraction buffer for 3 min and flushing into the same collection vial. The total final volume of extract was approximately 60 ml (depending on soil moisture and mass). Extractions were performed at room temperature as the tetracyclines are converted to their epi- or anhydroform when heated . Optimum conditions for the PLE method are summarised in Table 3 .\nBetween each run the extraction cells were cleaned by ultra-sonication for 15 min in a mixture of Milli-Q water methanol (50:50, v/v), followed by 15 min ultra-sonication in Milli-Q water.\nClean up and pre-concentration was performed using a combination of SAX cartridges (strong anion exhange, 500 mg sorbent, 6 ml cartridge) purchased from Isolute, IST, Mid Glamorgan, UK and Oasis HLB cartridges [poly(divinylbenzene\u2013co-N-pyrrolidone), 200 mg sorbent, 6 ml cartridge] purchased from Waters, Milford, MA, USA. Cartridges were placed in tandem to simultaneously remove negatively charged humic material (SAX) and retain the antibacterial agents (HLB) . The SAX cartridge was placed on top of the HLB cartridge and both columns were conditioned first with 2 ml methanol and then 2 ml 0.04 M citric acid buffer (pH 4.7). PLE extracts (60 ml) containing approximately 30 ml methanol were diluted with Milli-Q water to a methanol content below 10%. The diluted samples were passed through both SPE-columns at approximately 5 ml min\u22121 and after extraction the columns were washed with 2 ml 0.04 M citric acid buffer (pH 4.7) and 2 ml 0.1 M potassium acetate and dried under vacuum for 15 min. Then the SAX cartridge was removed and the antibacterial agents were eluted from the HLB-sorbent with 2 ml methanol.\nFor samples with expected low levels of antibacterial agents, method sensitivity was improved by combining three PLE extracts prior to pre-concentration and thereby achieving higher concentration in the final extracts.\nExperiments were performed to determine recoveries of the antibacterial agents CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL (A, B, C and D) and ERY for the tandem SPE (SAX+HLB) clean-up step only. Sample matrix was obtained by extracting non-spiked samples from the loamy sand soil (Askov) using the PLE method described in Section 2.3. These PLE extracts were fortified with antibacterial agents at two concentration levels (20 and 100 \u03bcg l\u22121), corresponding to extracts obtained from extraction of soil samples with antibacterial agent contents of approximately 40 and 200 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil, respectively. The fortified samples were diluted to 300 ml with Milli-Q water and passed through the SAX\u2013HLB SPE cartridges as described above.\nAnalysis of the resulting SPE extracts required two slightly different LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods (method I for CTC, OTC and SDZ and method II for TYL and ERY), which mainly differ in the MS settings (Tables 3 and 4 ). For both quantification methods (methods I and II), the analytical system consisted of an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), equipped with a degasser, a cooled autosampler (4 \u00b0C) and a cooled column oven (13 \u00b0C). Mass spectrometry detection was achieved using a Sciex API 3000 triple quadropole detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an ESI source (Turbo Ionspray). Collection and treatment of data were performed using Analyst software (Applied Biosystems) in Windows NT platform-based data processing.\nHPLC separations in both methods I and II were achieved using an Xterra MS-C18 analytical column (100mm\u00d72.1 mm, particle size 3.5 \u03bcm) from Waters and gradient elution. The composition of mobile phases, gradient elution, flow rates and injection volume for methods I and II, respectively, are listed in Table 3. Mobile phases were prepared by mixing methanol and 308 \u03bcl formic acid with Milli-Q water in a 1 l volumetric flask, followed by degassing by ultrasonication for 10 min.\nFor MS detection, the instrument was operated in the positive ion mode and detection of the antibacterial agents was obtained using MRM detection. Precursor mass and product ion mass for the MRM detection are listed in Table 4, together with the MS\u2013MS settings for methods I and II, respectively.\nThe response for each of the antibacterial agents detected in the LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods was evaluated for linearity, and the limits of detection and quantification for the instrument (LODinstrument and LOQinstrument) were determined, using calibration curves for the concentration range 1\u2013500 \u03bcg l\u22121. Stock solutions of the antibacterial agents were prepared in methanol, wrapped in tinfoil and stored at 5 \u00b0C for a maximum of 1 month. From two separate stock solutions duplicate standards were produced in methanol at eight concentration levels (1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 135, 270 and 500 \u03bcg l\u22121) and duplicate calibration curves for CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY were produced, by alternating the number of injections between two and six. To evaluate the method applicability to ECTC and the baseline separation of CTC and ECTC, the procedure was repeated for ECTC.\nLODinstrument and LOQinstrument were determined using the standard deviation of the response (\u03c3) and the slope of the calibration curves (S) : LODinstrument=3.3\u03c3S LOQinstrument=10\u03c3S\nRecoveries for the entire PLE\u2013SPE\u2013LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS procedures were determined for the loamy sand soil (Askov) and the sandy soil (Lundgaard). Soil samples from both soils were fortified with CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL (A, B, C and D) and ERY on four concentration levels (approximately 5, 25, 75 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil) and six replicates at each level. The fortified samples were extracted and analysed using the entire procedure. Recoveries were calculated as the percentage of extracted antibacterial agents compared to spiked level.\nTo compare recoveries obtained when combining three PLE extracts prior to SPE pre-concentration with recoveries obtained when only one PLE-extract were analysed, the recovery experiment for the 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil concentration level were performed using both procedures (six replicates, loamy sand soil only).\nDay-to-day variations for the extraction procedure were determined for the loamy sand soil (Askov), by repeating the recovery experiment for concentration levels 5, 25 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil after 3 days.\nFurthermore, the linearity range for the entire soil extraction procedure (PLE\u2013SPE\u2013LC\u2013MS\u2013MS) and limits of detection (LODsoil) and quantification (LOQsoil) were determined for the antibacterial agents for both soil types. Soil samples were fortified on six concentration levels (1, 5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil) with CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY to produce calibration curves. For the concentration levels 1, 25 and 75 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil, six replicates were produced, while duplicate samples were made for concentration levels 5, 50 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil. LODsoil and LOQsoil were determined using the standard deviation on the response (\u03c3) and the slope of the calibration curves (S) as described in Section 2.5.\nFor TYL B, C and D, LODsoil,estimated and LOQsoil,estimated were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio as S/N=3 and S/N=10, respectively, for soil samples containing 5 \u03bcg kg\u22121 TYL B, C or D.\nThe PLE-method for soil extraction was applied to extraction of antibacterial agents from grains. Ripe grains of spring barley were freeze-dried and ground in an electronic coffee mill to coarse flour. Equivalent to soil samples, 10 g flour was mixed with 10 g Ottawa sand in the PLE-extraction cell and PLE was performed following the procedure described in Section 2.3. The PLE extracts were filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter before combining two extracts and diluting with Milli-Q water to 500 ml. Tandem-SPE (SAX\u2013HLB) were performed equivalent to soil samples (Section 2.4.), but it was necessary to replace the SAX-cartridge for every 200 ml sample due to clogging of the sorbent. Quantification of the SPE-extracts was achieved using the LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods described in Section 2.5.\nRecoveries for the extraction of antibacterial agents from grain were determined for eight replicate flour samples fortified with CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY to a concentration of 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 flour. Limits of detection (LODgrain,estimated) and quantification (LOQgrain,estimated) for the grain extraction were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), as S/N=3 and 10, respectively.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of the soil extraction procedure to real field samples, soil samples were taken from two agricultural fields (loamy sand soil (Askov) and sandy soil (Lundgaard)) on several occasions after manure application in the period May to October 2000. The fields were located within two kilometres of each other, but represent to different soil types (Table 2). Liquid manure was obtained from a piglet-breeding farm where the animals were treated with CTC and TYL A and the content of antibacterial agents in the manure were estimated to be 300\u2013500 mg kg\u22121 dry mass manure, according to information from veterinary reports on treatments within the study period. The manure was applied according to Danish legislation to a level of 100 kg N ha\u22121 per year and ploughed to a depth of 20 cm, and spring barley was grown on the fields.\nDuplicate soil samples were taken from three plots on each field, using a soil auger to a depth of 20 cm. The soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve and the antibacterial agents were extracted and analysed as described in Sections 2.3\u20132.5.\nThe grain extraction method (Section 2.7) was applied to grains of spring barley harvested from plants grown on the agricultural fields (Askov and Lundgaard). The grains were harvested in August 2000 and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Pressurised liquid extraction of the antibacterial agents was performed after grinding of the grain samples, as described in Section 2.7.\nIn development and optimisation of the PLE method several parameters need to be considered such as soil sample size, soil moisture content, extraction solvent polarity and pH, and PLE-settings such as pressure, temperature and number of solvent cycles.\nIn order to obtain the highest possible concentrations of the antibacterial agents in soil extracts, the performance of the PLE-system was investigated for soil samples weighing up to 25 g. However, samples greater than 10 g soil caused clogging of the PLE extraction cell. To increase contact-surface between soil particles and extraction buffer and prevent clogging of the extraction cell, optimum moisture content of approximately 5% was found and 10 g Ottawa sand standard was mixed into 10 g soil sample before extraction.\nExtraction buffer for extracting the antibacterial agents from soil was selected in accordance with the physico-chemical properties of the compounds (Table 1). Many different soil-adsorption mechanisms, such as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, complexation and cation exchange, may affect the extraction of the compounds from soil. This was found particularly important for the tetracyclines as they form strong complexes with di- and trivalent cations in the clay mineral inter-layers or to hydroxy-groups at the surface of the soil particles and therefore a complexation agent was added to the extraction buffer. As a starting point a combination of McIlvaine buffer (citric acid and potassium phosphate), EDTA and methanol was applied as extraction buffer, as previously employed for food analysis and soil extractions . However, this buffer precipitated within few hours, on occasions causing blockage in the tubes and valves of the PLE system. An extraction buffer containing methanol and only citric acid buffer (pH adjusted to 4.7) as complexation agent was therefore assessed for extraction efficiency. Recoveries achieved using this method were above 40%, which were comparable to recoveries for the McIlvaine+EDTA combination (<25\u201370%) and method development continued with the citric acid + methanol combination. At pH 4.7 CTC, OTC and SDZ are overall neutral and therefore have reasonably high affinity for the moderately hydrophobic extraction buffer, while TYL A and ERY are positively charged but due to their hydrophobicity they are extractable using the same buffer (see Table 1 for pK a and log K ow values).\nThe influence of the citric acid concentration in the extraction buffer was investigated by performing the PLE-extraction for the concentration range 0.2\u20130.5 M citric acid adjusted to pH 4.7. No significant difference in recovery was found (ranging from 24\u201333 to 30\u201335%). Correspondingly, the relative content of methanol in the buffer in the range 50\u201375% was tested and a slightly higher recovery was found when using 50% methanol (40\u201343% as compared to 36\u201339% for 75% methanol). Furthermore, increasing the methanol content resulted in increased colouring of the PLE-extract, which required additional sample clean-up. Hence, the buffer composition used in subsequent analysis was 50% methanol and 50% 0.2 M citric acid with pH adjusted to 4.7.\nThe PLE extraction conditions were set to 10 min extraction at 1500 psi at room temperature, followed by another flush of solvent for 3 min. No additional extraction of the antibacterial agents was achieved using a second and third flush. Optimum conditions are listed in Section 2.3 and summarised in Table 3.\nTwo different LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods (methods I and II) were required for the analysis of the antibacterial agents due to differences in physico-chemical properties (Table 1). In Fig. 1 , chromatograms for MRM analysis of soil samples containing 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil of the antibacterial agents show negligible baseline noise when using MRM detection and that only analyte peaks occur in the chromatograms. Epi-chlortetracycline (ECTC) and CTC have the same precursor and product ions masses and therefore occur in the same chromatogram, but the peaks are separated.\nAs shown in Table 5 , the methods were linear in the complete concentration range tested (1 and 500 \u03bcg l\u22121, equivalent to 0.07\u201333 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil) and covers the requirements for most environmental soil samples containing antibacterial agents. The limits of detection (LODinstrument) and quantification (LOQinstrument) are listed in Table 5. These values correspond to soil concentrations of 0.5\u20131.5 and 1.5\u20135 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil, respectively, assuming that 3\u00d710 g soil is extracted and concentrated to 2 ml SPE extract.\nThe combination of the SAX and the HLB (polymeric) SPE sorbents act as both clean-up and pre-concentration. The SAX column reduces matrix interferences by adsorbing anionic humic particles from the soil extracts, avoiding contamination, blocking and overloading of the HLB sorbent. At a buffer pH of 4.7, the antibacterial agents are overall neutral or cations (Table 1) and are therefore not retained on the SAX cartridge, while the polymer based HLB cartridge simultaneously retains neutral polar and non-polar compounds, including the studied antibacterial agents.\nDilution of the PLE extracts with Milli-Q water to a methanol content below 10%, were primarily performed to avoid continuous elution of the antibacterial agents from the HLB sorption material, but additionally the buffer capacity (20 mM citric acid) remained sufficient to keep a sample pH of 4.7 after dilution.\nRecoveries and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the SPE method at two concentration levels (approximately 20 and 100 \u03bcg l\u22121 in the final extract) are listed in Table 6 . The SPE method is optimised for tetracyclines, i.e. sorbent material and sample pH, and recoveries for these compounds (CTC and OTC) are above 80%. The method is also applicable for the macrolides (TYL A and ERY) with recoveries above 80% and for the degradation products, with recoveries of approximately 100% for TYL B and TYL D and approximately 70% for TYL C. The sulfonamides are a more hydrophilic group of antibacterial agents and recoveries of approximately 85% for SDZ were found. SDZ is one of the more hydrophilic sulfonamides (logKow=\u22120.092), but some sulfonamides are even more hydrophilic, i.e. sulfanilamide (SUL, logKow=\u22120.719) .\nMean recoveries and corresponding confidence intervals for the PLE-extraction of six replicate soil samples are listed in Table 7 . Recoveries for all antibacterial agents are satisfactorily high and the standard deviations on six replicate samples are low, as demonstrated by narrow confidence intervals.\nFor the tetracyclines (OTC and CTC) recoveries of approximately 50\u201370% are achieved, which is lower than recoveries obtained for the SPE method, indicating that the compounds are not fully extracted from the soil. This is probably due to the many sorption mechanisms involved in the binding of tetracyclines to soil, resulting in very strong sorption (Table 1). Recoveries for the two soil types are comparable, but with a tendency towards higher recoveries in the sandy soil. This corresponds well with previous studies indicating that tetracyclines primarily sorb to the clay fraction of the soil by complexation and hydrogen bonding . However, almost identical K d values for OTC for the loamy sand and sandy soil have been determined , which may correspond to binding to acid sites in organic fraction in the soil, i.e. humic acid .\nFor the macrolides (TYL A and ERY), the recoveries range from 50 to above 100%, depending on spike concentration and soil type. Recoveries for ERY are highest in the sandy soil, in which the content of clay and organic carbon is lower than the loamy sand soil. This indicates that ERY mainly sorbs to the organic fraction or clay by hydrophobic interactions. Contrary, recoveries for TYL A are higher in the loamy sand soil, which is inconsistent with the partition coefficients determined by , showing much stronger sorption to the loamy sand soil as compared to the sandy soil (Table 1). Possibly the PLE solvent (citricacid+methanol) is not optimal for extracting TYL from soil and higher extraction efficiency may be achieved by using a more hydrophobic solvent. However, for the degradation products TYL B, C, and D, satisfactory recoveries are obtained, indicating that the soil extraction method is also applicable for these compounds.\nFor SDZ recoveries of approximately 80% for the complete soil extraction method are comparable to the recoveries achieved for the SPE method only, indicating that SDZ are fully extracted from the soil using the PLE procedure, but is partly lost during the SPE concentration.\nIt was examined whether comparable results were obtained when combining three PLE extracts prior to the SPE concentration rather than working with only one extract, by performing the recovery experiment for the 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil level using both procedures. No significant deviation between procedures was found, as the 95% confidence intervals for recoveries overlap (Table 7). Furthermore, the calibration curve for the entire soil extraction method (see Section 3.5.) consisted of three points where three extracts were combined (1, 5 and 25 \u03bcg kg\u22121) and three points where only one extract were concentrated (50, 75 and 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121), and the calibration curves were linear in the complete range (Table 8 ). This also demonstrates that no matrix effect or breakthrough of the SPE cartridges happened when a 1 l sample was extracted.\nDay-to-day variation was investigated for the loamy sand soil and the results are shown in Table 7. Significant day-to-day variation is determined as not-overlapping 95% confidence intervals for recoveries obtained on the same concentration level on different days. For some experiments day-to-day variation is demonstrated even though the recoveries are comparable, which is due to the low standard deviations obtained for six replicate samples and corresponding narrow confidence intervals.\nCalibration curves were produced for the entire soil extraction procedure, by fortifying soil samples from the loamy sand soil and the sandy soil with the antibacterial agents at six concentration levels, Validation results are shown in Table 8. Linear calibration curves were obtained for all compounds and for both soils, with regression coefficients (R 2) in the range of 0.94\u20130.99 and linearity range of approximately 1\u2013100 \u03bcg kg\u22121, which is the complete range tested. For the entire soil extraction method, LODsoil and LOQsoil were estimated from the standard deviation and slope of the calibration curves (Section 2.5). Values obtained for LODsoil and LOQsoil for the antibacterial agents were in the range <1\u20135 and 1\u201310 \u03bcg kg\u22121, respectively, which covers the range expected for environmental soil samples . For the degradation products TYL B, C and D, LODsoil,estimated and LOQsoil,estimated were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and were in the same range as the parent compound, TYL A (Table 8). These levels of quantitation are relatively low and make the analytical method applicable for analysing most environmental soil samples for the studied antibacterial agents.\nThe liquid manure applied to the agricultural fields was obtained from pigs treated with CTC and TYL A and no other antibacterial agents (OTC, ERY or SDZ) were detected in the soil samples. The measured concentrations of CTC and TYL A in the soil samples taken from the two manure-amended fields are shown in Table 9 . The first sample (9 May 2000) was obtained 9 days after manure application and show concentrations of approximately 10\u201315 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil for CTC in both soils and 25\u201355 and 10\u201320 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil for TYL A in the loamy sand and sandy soil, respectively. These concentrations decline continuously during the following 146 days period. Concentrations in samples taken on the last date of sampling (2 October 2000), was below or near the LODsoil for CTC and approximately 15 and 3 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for TYL A for the loamy sand and sandy soil, respectively. Hence, the method is applicable for monitoring of the antibacterial agents levels in field samples over time.\nSome deviation is seen between the concentrations measured on the three different plots on each field at each sampling day. This is probably due to heterogeneous mixing of soil and manure, and it is seen that the deviation declines during the period of sampling. Deviations between measured concentrations in field samples were also demonstrated by Hamscher et al. , who measured high concentrations of CTC in heterogeneously distributed manure aggregates.\nFlour of grinded barley grains was extracted to evaluate whether any detectable uptake of antibacterials agents by barley plants occurred. The PLE extraction procedure was applied with only few modifications, i.e. a filtration step prior to SPE clean-up and replacement of the SAX-cartridge for every 200 ml sample. Recoveries for the grain extraction were determined for spiked grain samples and were 42.3% (34\u201350) for CTC, 31.8% (28\u201336) for OTC, 53.5% (47\u201360) for TYL A, 56.5% (52\u201361) for ERY and 39.9% (38\u201342) for SDZ (95% CI in brackets). These recoveries are equivalent to recoveries obtained for soil extractions and demonstrate that the antibacterial agents are not lost due to the considerable amounts of suspended flour particles in the samples or during filtration.\nLODgrain,estimated and LOQgrain,estimated for the grain extraction were estimated using the signal-to-noise ratio for flour samples fortified to 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 of each of the antibacterial agents. Estimated values for LODgrain,estimated were 0.3, 0.4, 1.4, 1.5 and 0.2 \u03bcg kg\u22121 grain for CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY, respectively. Corresponding LOQgrain,estimated values were in the range 0.6\u20135.0 \u03bcg kg\u22121 grain.\nTo test the procedure on real field samples, non-spiked grain samples were harvested from fields amended with liquid manure and extracted using the procedure described in Section 2.7. None of the antibacterial agents were measured in concentration levels above LODgrain,estimated. The grains were harvested in August when the soil content of CTC and TYL A had declined to below 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 soil (Table 9), so apparently the antibacterial agents have not been taken up by plants and accumulated in the grains in detectable amounts.\nSimultaneous extraction of CTC, OTC, SDZ, TYL A and ERY from soil was obtained using a simple PLE method followed by clean-up and concentration using SPE and analysis by two slightly different LC\u2013ESI-MS\u2013MS methods (methods I and II). Recoveries and LODsoil and LOQsoil for the extraction procedure were satisfactory, demonstrating that the procedure is applicable for environmental samples.\nWithin each group of antibacterial agents, i.e. tetracyclines, macrolides and sulfonamides, there was some variation between the recoveries achieved for the representatives and interpretation of the applicability of the methods for other compounds in each group is difficult. However, the compounds examined in this study represent a wide range of physico-chemical properties and therefore the method is expected to be applicable to many of the antibacterial agents present simultaneously in manure.\nThe soil extraction procedure was optimised for tetracyclines and higher recoveries could probably be achieved for the macrolides and sulfonamides, if modifying the method with regards to these compounds. However, this procedure represents a useful compromise for simultaneous extraction of all three groups of antibacterial agents from soil."

Triazine herbicides and their degradation products have caused great concern because they are of high toxicity and persistent in water, soil and organisms. As a consequence of proven carcinogenic and endocrine disturbing action of these, monitoring of herbicides in food has become an important aspect of environmental and health safeguard. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an analytical method with high sensitivity to meet the requirement for determination of herbicide residues.\nDue to the matrix complexity of the samples and the low concentration of these compounds, triazines are routinely identified and quantified by gas chromatography (GC) , high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) , gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS) , where a preconcentration step is usually needed. Various sample preparation methods have been established for extraction and preconcentration of herbicide residues from the matrix, such as liquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE) , solid-phase extraction (SPE) and cloud point extraction (CPE) , but the disadvantages such as intensive labor, time consuming, unsatisfactory enrichment factor and large quantity of toxic solvent, limit their application. In recent years, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has been developed for the pretreatment of herbicides. It is a solvent-free, fast process that includes simultaneous extraction and preconcentration of analytes from aqueous samples. But in SPME, the extraction fiber is expensive, fragile and has a limited lifetime. Liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) was performed by using a single drop of solvent or solvent-based hollow fiber. It is inexpensive and minimal exposure to toxic organic solvents. However, there are some disadvantages such as the fast stirring would tend to break up the organic drop and form air bubble, long extraction time, low sensitivity and repeatability.\nIn order to overcome the disadvantages, dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (DLLME) which is based on a ternary component solvent system, such as homogeneous liquid\u2013liquid extraction and cloud point extraction, was proposed recently. In this method, the appropriate mixture of extraction solvent and dispersant was injected into an aqueous sample rapidly by syringe, and the extraction solvent was dispersed into the aqueous sample as very fine droplets, so the analytes were easily transferred into the extraction solvent. When extraction equilibrium was obtained, phase separation was performed by centrifugation, and the enriched analytes in the sediment phase were determined by chromatographic method. The advantages of the DLLME are simplicity of operation, rapidity, low cost and high enrichment factors. And more importantly, it could be applied under batch conditions and extraction could be completed in several seconds thus resulting in faster extraction and shorter analytical time. This method has been successfully applied for the preconcentration of organic and inorganic species in environmental samples. Chen et al. reported dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography as an efficient and sensitive technique for simultaneous determination of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol in honey.\nRoom temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), are a group of new organic salts consisting of organic cations and various anions that are liquids at room temperature. The unique chemical and physical properties of RTILs include their immeasurably low vapour pressure, incombustibility, good thermal stability, tunable viscosity and miscibility with water and organic solvents, as well as good extractability for various organic compounds and metal ions .\nIn this paper, a method to determine triazines, including chlortoluron, prometon, propazine, linuron, and prebane from honey by DLLME HPLC was developed. To our knowledge, the reports about application of DLLME in herbicide determination were scarce. In this method, RTIL was used as the extraction solvent and Triton X 114 was used as the dispersant. The factors influencing DLLME were optimized. The method was successfully applied to the determination of herbicide residues from honey samples.\nAnalytical grade of sodium chloride was purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory (Beijing, China). Triton X 114 was purchased from Beijing Biotechnological Company (Beijing, China). Chromatographic grade of acetonitrile was purchased from Fisher Scientific Company (UK). Chlortoluron, prometon, propazine, linuron and prebane standard were obtained from National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China) and the structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1 . The stock solutions of the triazines were prepared by dissolving each individual standard of triazines in acetonitrile and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Pure water was obtained with a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Co., USA). 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C4MIM][PF6]) and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C6MIM][PF6]) were purchased from Cheng-jie Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).\nIn the study, four honey samples, including one kind of medlar honey (sample 1), one kind of locust honey (sample 2) and two kinds of linden honey (samples 3 and 4) were used. Except for the experiments mentioned in Section 4.2, which were performed on all four kinds of samples, all other results were obtained with sample 4. 2.0 g of honey was weighed and added into a 25 mL of centrifugal tube. 20 mL of water was added into it and the mixture was vortexed until a homogeneous sample solution was obtained. The spiked honey samples at concentration levels of 300, 100, 50 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for each individual triazine were prepared by simultaneously spiking the standard solutions of the triazines into the sample solutions and left alone for about 30 min. Then, the spiked samples were used for DLLME-HPLC analysis directly after being filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm micropore membrane.\nThe 1100 series liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) equipped with photodiode-array detector (DAD) was used. The chromatographic separation of the analytes was carried out on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7 150 mm, Agilent, USA).\n20 mL of a homogeneous sample solution containing the analytes and 0.6 g NaCl were placed in a 25 mL centrifugal tube. 175 \u03bcL of RTIL and 50 \u03bcL of 10% Triton X 114 were injected rapidly into the sample solution by using 100 \u03bcL syringe. Then the mixture was shaken by hands for 10 min. RTIL was dispersed as very fine droplets into sample solution, and the analytes were extracted into the fine droplets. After centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm, about 95 \u03bcL of RTIL was deposited in the bottom of the centrifugal tube. 5 \u03bcL of RTIL was taken out with the HPLC microsyringe and injected into the HPLC system. All experiments were performed in triplicate.\nThe flow rate of the mobile phase was kept at 1 mL/min. Sample injection volume was 5 \u03bcL and temperature of the column was controlled at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase A and B were water and acetonitrile, respectively. The gradient conditions are as follows: 0\u201312 min, 20\u201340% B; 12\u201317 min, 42% B; 17\u201321 min, 44% B; 21\u201323 min, 50% B; 23\u201325 min, 60% B. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 246 nm for chlortoluron, prometon, linuron and 228 nm for propazine, prebane.\nThe working solutions were prepared by diluting the mixed standard solutions with acetonitrile. 5 \u03bcL of working solutions were introduced into HPLC and analyzed under the chromatographic conditions mentioned above. The standard curves were obtained by plotting the peak areas versus the concentrations of analytes in working solutions and are listed in Table 1 . The curves were applied to calculating enrichment factor and extraction recovery in selection of experimental conditions.\nA certain amounts of the mixed standard solutions were added into the honey samples. The resulting samples were pretreated by the extraction procedure mentioned above. 5 \u03bcL of the sedimented phase (RTIL) was injected in HPLC and analyzed under the chromatographic conditions mentioned above. The curves were obtained by plotting peak areas versus the concentrations of the analytes in the honey samples. The curves were applied to evaluating the performances of the proposed method in evaluation of the method.\nTo obtain a high recovery and enrichment factor, the effect of different factors, such as volume of extraction solvent, concentration of dispersant, pH value of sample solution, salt concentration and extraction time, were examined and optimal conditions were selected. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, extraction recovery and enrichment factor were applied. Eqs. (1) and (2) were applied for calculating enrichment factor (EF) and recovery (R). EF=CsedC0 where C sed and C 0 were the concentration of analyte in sedimented phase and initial concentration of analyte in sample solution, respectively. R=Csed\u00d7VsedC0\u00d7Vaq\u00d7100%=EF\u00d7VsedVaq\u00d7100% where V sed and V aq were the volume of sedimented phase and volume of sample solution, respectively.\nIn DLLME process, it is very important to select an appropriate extraction solvent. The solvent should have good chromatographic behavior under the selected HPLC conditions, higher density than water, high capability to extract the interesting analytes and low solubility in water. In this study, [C4MIM][PF6] and [C6MIM][PF6] were applied to the extraction of analytes. The enrichment factor obtained with [C4MIM][PF6] was higher than that obtained with [C6MIM][PF6], but the extraction recovery obtained with [C6MIM][PF6] was higher than that obtained with [C4MIM][PF6]. In consideration of the accuracy, [C6MIM][PF6] was selected and used as extraction solvent.\nIn order to evaluate the influence of extraction solvent volume on extraction efficiency, sample solutions containing different volumes of [C6MIM][PF6] were subjected to the same DLLME. The volume of sedimented phase was 50, 75, 100, 125 \u03bcL when the volume of extraction solvent was 125, 150, 175 and 200 \u03bcL respectively. Fig. 2 shows the effect of volume of extraction solvent on the extraction recoveries and enrichment factors, respectively. The results indicate that the extraction recoveries for the analytes increase with increasing the volume of [C6MIM][PF6]. However, from Fig. 2, it also can be seen that enrichment factors decrease with increasing the volume of [C6MIM][PF6], because the volume of sedimented phase increases. 175 \u03bcL was the best compromise between recovery and enrichment and selected in the further experiments.\nThe influence of dispersant concentration was examined when the concentrations of dispersant were 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2%. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 . It is seen from Fig. 3 that the extraction recoveries increase first and then decrease with increasing the concentration of Triton X 114. When the concentration of dispersant was too low, cloudy state was not formed well, and the recovery was low and when the concentration of Triton X 114 was too high, the transfer of the analytes into the extraction solvent was limited. Finally 0.05% of dispersant was selected in the further experiments.\nThe pH of the sample solution plays an important role in the extraction of organic compounds. Therefore, the effect of pH was studied. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the extraction recovery is highest at pH 7.0. Hence, pH 7.0 was chosen in the following experiments.\nThe influence of the ionic strength of the solution was evaluated by adding NaCl (0\u201310%) into the sample solution. Plots of extraction recovery versus ionic strength are shown in Fig. 5 . According to the plots in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the extraction recoveries first increase, and then decrease with the increase of ionic strength. When the concentration of NaCl is not very high, the salt out effect plays the predominant role. However, when concentration of salt is too high, the ion exchange occurs between [C6MIM][PF6] and chloride, which makes [C6MIM]Cl soluble in water . Although the volume of the sediment phase decreased to about 95 \u03bcL, the enrichment factors of all analytes increased with the concentration of NaCl. Therefore, in further work, a NaCl concentration of 3% was selected.\nIn DLLME, extraction time is defined as interval time between the injection of the mixture of dispersant (Triton 114) and extraction solvent ([C6MIM][PF6]) and the centrifugation. The influence of extraction time was examined in the range of 1-30 min. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the extraction recoveries increase with the extraction time before 10 min, and then remains constant with the increase of time. So, the extraction time selected was 10 min.\nUnder the above mentioned optimal experimental conditions, a series of experiments were performed for obtaining linear range, precision and detection limit. The results are shown in Table 2 . The selected herbicides exhibit good linearity with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9939\u20130.9976. The detection limits were determined based on the signal to noise (S/N) ratio of 3 and found to be 5.31\u20138.59 \u03bcg kg\u22121.\nThe applicability of the proposed method was evaluated with four kinds of honey samples. The typical chromatograms of blank and spiked samples are shown in Fig. 7 . The results indicate that the samples were free of triazines. To examine the applicability and accuracy of the method, the spiked samples were analyzed. The analytical results shown in Table 3 indicate that the present method provides acceptable recoveries (60.1\u2013133%) and precisions (0.4\u201316.5%) for triazines. The results also indicate that recoveries, particularly of linuron and prebane, increase with the increase of concentration of analytes. To determine if there is a correlation between the recovery and concentration of analyte, the relationship between the recovery and concentration was described as a linear regression equation. Based on the data in Table 3, the linear correlation coefficients for the regression equations were obtained and listed in Table 4 . To judge the correlation F test (Eq. (3)) was applied and the F values obtained also listed in Table 4. F=r2(n\u22122)1\u2212r2 where r is correlation coefficient and n is the number of concentration levels.\nIt is seen from Table 4 that the recoveries should not be concentration-dependent because all the F values are lower than F 0.05(1,1) value (161).\nIn this study a novel method was developed for the determination of triazines in honey. The advantages of the method are simple, inexpensive, rapid and friendly to the environment due to the use of green organic solvent. High enrichment factors and acceptable recoveries were achieved. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method would be a valuable alternative for the determination of the herbicide residues in honey.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

This method has been successfully applied for the preconcentration of organic and inorganic species in environmental samples. Chen et al. reported dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography as an efficient and sensitive technique for simultaneous determination of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol in honey.\nRoom temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), are a group of new organic salts consisting of organic cations and various anions that are liquids at room temperature. The unique chemical and physical properties of RTILs include their immeasurably low vapour pressure, incombustibility, good thermal stability, tunable viscosity and miscibility with water and organic solvents, as well as good extractability for various organic compounds and metal ions .\nIn this paper, a method to determine triazines, including chlortoluron, prometon, propazine, linuron, and prebane from honey by DLLME HPLC was developed. To our knowledge, the reports about application of DLLME in herbicide determination were scarce. In this method, RTIL was used as the extraction solvent and Triton X 114 was used as the dispersant. The factors influencing DLLME were optimized. The method was successfully applied to the determination of herbicide residues from honey samples.\nAnalytical grade of sodium chloride was purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory (Beijing, China). Triton X 114 was purchased from Beijing Biotechnological Company (Beijing, China). Chromatographic grade of acetonitrile was purchased from Fisher Scientific Company (UK). Chlortoluron, prometon, propazine, linuron and prebane standard were obtained from National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China) and the structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1 . The stock solutions of the triazines were prepared by dissolving each individual standard of triazines in acetonitrile and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Pure water was obtained with a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Co., USA). 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C4MIM][PF6]) and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C6MIM][PF6]) were purchased from Cheng-jie Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).\nIn the study, four honey samples, including one kind of medlar honey (sample 1), one kind of locust honey (sample 2) and two kinds of linden honey (samples 3 and 4) were used. Except for the experiments mentioned in Section 4.2, which were performed on all four kinds of samples, all other results were obtained with sample 4. 2.0 g of honey was weighed and added into a 25 mL of centrifugal tube. 20 mL of water was added into it and the mixture was vortexed until a homogeneous sample solution was obtained. The spiked honey samples at concentration levels of 300, 100, 50 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for each individual triazine were prepared by simultaneously spiking the standard solutions of the triazines into the sample solutions and left alone for about 30 min. Then, the spiked samples were used for DLLME-HPLC analysis directly after being filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm micropore membrane.\nThe 1100 series liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) equipped with photodiode-array detector (DAD) was used. The chromatographic separation of the analytes was carried out on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7 150 mm, Agilent, USA).\n20 mL of a homogeneous sample solution containing the analytes and 0.6 g NaCl were placed in a 25 mL centrifugal tube. 175 \u03bcL of RTIL and 50 \u03bcL of 10% Triton X 114 were injected rapidly into the sample solution by using 100 \u03bcL syringe. Then the mixture was shaken by hands for 10 min. RTIL was dispersed as very fine droplets into sample solution, and the analytes were extracted into the fine droplets. After centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm, about 95 \u03bcL of RTIL was deposited in the bottom of the centrifugal tube. 5 \u03bcL of RTIL was taken out with the HPLC microsyringe and injected into the HPLC system. All experiments were performed in triplicate.\nThe flow rate of the mobile phase was kept at 1 mL/min. Sample injection volume was 5 \u03bcL and temperature of the column was controlled at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase A and B were water and acetonitrile, respectively. The gradient conditions are as follows: 0\u201312 min, 20\u201340% B; 12\u201317 min, 42% B; 17\u201321 min, 44% B; 21\u201323 min, 50% B; 23\u201325 min, 60% B. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 246 nm for chlortoluron, prometon, linuron and 228 nm for propazine, prebane.\nThe working solutions were prepared by diluting the mixed standard solutions with acetonitrile. 5 \u03bcL of working solutions were introduced into HPLC and analyzed under the chromatographic conditions mentioned above. The standard curves were obtained by plotting the peak areas versus the concentrations of analytes in working solutions and are listed in Table 1 . The curves were applied to calculating enrichment factor and extraction recovery in selection of experimental conditions.\nA certain amounts of the mixed standard solutions were added into the honey samples. The resulting samples were pretreated by the extraction procedure mentioned above. 5 \u03bcL of the sedimented phase (RTIL) was injected in HPLC and analyzed under the chromatographic conditions mentioned above. The curves were obtained by plotting peak areas versus the concentrations of the analytes in the honey samples. The curves were applied to evaluating the performances of the proposed method in evaluation of the method.\nTo obtain a high recovery and enrichment factor, the effect of different factors, such as volume of extraction solvent, concentration of dispersant, pH value of sample solution, salt concentration and extraction time, were examined and optimal conditions were selected. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, extraction recovery and enrichment factor were applied. Eqs. (1) and (2) were applied for calculating enrichment factor (EF) and recovery (R). EF=CsedC0 where C sed and C 0 were the concentration of analyte in sedimented phase and initial concentration of analyte in sample solution, respectively. R=Csed\u00d7VsedC0\u00d7Vaq\u00d7100%=EF\u00d7VsedVaq\u00d7100% where V sed and V aq were the volume of sedimented phase and volume of sample solution, respectively.\nIn DLLME process, it is very important to select an appropriate extraction solvent. The solvent should have good chromatographic behavior under the selected HPLC conditions, higher density than water, high capability to extract the interesting analytes and low solubility in water. In this study, [C4MIM][PF6] and [C6MIM][PF6] were applied to the extraction of analytes. The enrichment factor obtained with [C4MIM][PF6] was higher than that obtained with [C6MIM][PF6], but the extraction recovery obtained with [C6MIM][PF6] was higher than that obtained with [C4MIM][PF6]. In consideration of the accuracy, [C6MIM][PF6] was selected and used as extraction solvent.\nIn order to evaluate the influence of extraction solvent volume on extraction efficiency, sample solutions containing different volumes of [C6MIM][PF6] were subjected to the same DLLME. The volume of sedimented phase was 50, 75, 100, 125 \u03bcL when the volume of extraction solvent was 125, 150, 175 and 200 \u03bcL respectively. Fig. 2 shows the effect of volume of extraction solvent on the extraction recoveries and enrichment factors, respectively. The results indicate that the extraction recoveries for the analytes increase with increasing the volume of [C6MIM][PF6]. However, from Fig. 2, it also can be seen that enrichment factors decrease with increasing the volume of [C6MIM][PF6], because the volume of sedimented phase increases. 175 \u03bcL was the best compromise between recovery and enrichment and selected in the further experiments.\nThe influence of dispersant concentration was examined when the concentrations of dispersant were 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2%. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 . It is seen from Fig. 3 that the extraction recoveries increase first and then decrease with increasing the concentration of Triton X 114. When the concentration of dispersant was too low, cloudy state was not formed well, and the recovery was low and when the concentration of Triton X 114 was too high, the transfer of the analytes into the extraction solvent was limited. Finally 0.05% of dispersant was selected in the further experiments.\nThe pH of the sample solution plays an important role in the extraction of organic compounds. Therefore, the effect of pH was studied. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the extraction recovery is highest at pH 7.0. Hence, pH 7.0 was chosen in the following experiments.\nThe influence of the ionic strength of the solution was evaluated by adding NaCl (0\u201310%) into the sample solution. Plots of extraction recovery versus ionic strength are shown in Fig. 5 . According to the plots in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the extraction recoveries first increase, and then decrease with the increase of ionic strength. When the concentration of NaCl is not very high, the salt out effect plays the predominant role. However, when concentration of salt is too high, the ion exchange occurs between [C6MIM][PF6] and chloride, which makes [C6MIM]Cl soluble in water . Although the volume of the sediment phase decreased to about 95 \u03bcL, the enrichment factors of all analytes increased with the concentration of NaCl. Therefore, in further work, a NaCl concentration of 3% was selected.\nIn DLLME, extraction time is defined as interval time between the injection of the mixture of dispersant (Triton 114) and extraction solvent ([C6MIM][PF6]) and the centrifugation. The influence of extraction time was examined in the range of 1-30 min. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the extraction recoveries increase with the extraction time before 10 min, and then remains constant with the increase of time. So, the extraction time selected was 10 min.\nUnder the above mentioned optimal experimental conditions, a series of experiments were performed for obtaining linear range, precision and detection limit. The results are shown in Table 2 . The selected herbicides exhibit good linearity with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9939\u20130.9976. The detection limits were determined based on the signal to noise (S/N) ratio of 3 and found to be 5.31\u20138.59 \u03bcg kg\u22121.\nThe applicability of the proposed method was evaluated with four kinds of honey samples. The typical chromatograms of blank and spiked samples are shown in Fig. 7 . The results indicate that the samples were free of triazines. To examine the applicability and accuracy of the method, the spiked samples were analyzed. The analytical results shown in Table 3 indicate that the present method provides acceptable recoveries (60.1\u2013133%) and precisions (0.4\u201316.5%) for triazines. The results also indicate that recoveries, particularly of linuron and prebane, increase with the increase of concentration of analytes. To determine if there is a correlation between the recovery and concentration of analyte, the relationship between the recovery and concentration was described as a linear regression equation. Based on the data in Table 3, the linear correlation coefficients for the regression equations were obtained and listed in Table 4 . To judge the correlation F test (Eq. (3)) was applied and the F values obtained also listed in Table 4. F=r2(n\u22122)1\u2212r2 where r is correlation coefficient and n is the number of concentration levels.\nIt is seen from Table 4 that the recoveries should not be concentration-dependent because all the F values are lower than F 0.05(1,1) value (161).\nIn this study a novel method was developed for the determination of triazines in honey. The advantages of the method are simple, inexpensive, rapid and friendly to the environment due to the use of green organic solvent. High enrichment factors and acceptable recoveries were achieved. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method would be a valuable alternative for the determination of the herbicide residues in honey."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nMolecular biology has recently concentrated on the determination of multiple gene-expression changes at the RNA level, either between subjects, or following drug treatment or other interventions (transcriptomics). Much effort has also been put into determination of multiple protein-expression changes in a cell or tissue (proteomics). The main problem with interpreting transcriptomics and proteomics is often the difficulty of relating observed gene-expression fold changes or protein-level (not activity) changes to conventional disease and pharmaceutically relevant end-points.\nAt the small-molecule metabolite level, similar developments have been taking place, leading to the marked expansion in studies now termed metabonomics and metabolomics . As will be shown, this approach can be used to provide comprehensive and simultaneous systematic profiling of metabolite levels in biofluids and tissues and their systematic and temporal changes, such effects arising not only from control by the host genome but from extended genomes (e.g., those provided by the gut bacteria present in all mammals) and the effects of other environmental factors (e.g., diet, drug therapy and life style). The techniques and applications have been reviewed in a recent book .\nAnimals and man can be considered as \u201csuper-organisms\u201d with an internal ecosystem of diverse symbiotic gut microflora (often with unknown genomes) that have metabolic processes that interact with the host. The complexity of mammalian biological systems and the diverse features that need to be measured to allow \u201comics\u201d data to be fully interpreted have been reviewed recently and novel approaches will be required to measure and to model such co-metabolic processes .\nLong prior to the development of the various \u201comics\u201d approaches, the simultaneous analysis of the plethora of metabolites seen in biological fluids had been carried out largely using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy , but also using mass spectrometry (MS) , and it was shown that these complex data sets could be interpreted using multi-variate statistics .\nMetabonomics studies generally use biofluids or cell or tissue extracts, and these are often easily available. Urine and plasma are obtained essentially non-invasively, so they can be used more easily for disease diagnosis and, in a clinical trials setting, for monitoring drug therapy. However, there is a wide range of fluids that have been studied, including seminal fluids, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, digestive fluids, blister and cyst fluids, lung aspirates and dialysis fluids . In addition, a number of metabonomics studies have used analysis of tissue-biopsy samples and their lipid and aqueous extracts, as well as in vitro cell systems (e.g., Caco-2 cells ), model systems (e.g., yeast ), tumor cells and spheroids , and there is a large literature on plant-metabolism studies .\nThe understanding of molecular biology has seen a dramatic expansion recently with the decoding of the human genome and other genomes, and the integration of gene-expression and proteomic data. However, only metabonomics has the power to provide information on complete living systems at the individual level or the population level, and, for this reason, metabonomics can be seen as the fulcrum of top-down systems biology (rather than the study of single-gene effects, which is a bottom-up approach).\nThe main analytical techniques employed for metabonomic studies are based on NMR spectroscopy and MS. The latter technique generally requires pre-separation of the metabolic components using either gas chromatography (GC) after chemical derivatization, or liquid chromatography (LC), with the newer method of ultra-high-pressure LC (UPLC) being used increasingly. The use of capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to MS has also shown some promise. Other more specialized techniques (e.g., Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and arrayed electrochemical detection) have been used in some cases. The main limitation of the use of these latter techniques is the low level of detailed molecular identification that can be achieved, so MS is also usually employed for metabolite identification.\nNMR spectroscopy provides detailed information on molecular structure, for pure compounds and in complex mixtures, but it can also be used to probe metabolite molecular dynamics and mobility through the interpretation of NMR spin-relaxation times and by the determination of molecular diffusion coefficients. Commercially available instruments up to an observation frequency for 1H of 950 MHz are available (with higher frequencies on the way), and, for small-molecule studies, the increased sensitivity and dispersion that results are of great value and there are no potential disadvantages, as could be the situation for macromolecules. Shown in Fig. 1 is the recently installed 800 MHz NMR spectrometer at Imperial College London that is used extensively for biomarker identification in metabonomics studies.\nAutomatic sample preparation involves simply buffering (in the case of urine) and addition of D2O as a magnetic field lock signal for the spectrometer, and standard NMR spectra typically take only a few minutes to acquire using robotic flow-injection methods. For large-scale studies, bar-coded vials containing the biofluid can be used and the contents of these can be transferred and prepared for analysis using robotic liquid-handling technology into 96-well plates under control of a laboratory information management system (LIMS). Currently, using such approaches, well over 100 samples per day can be measured on one spectrometer. Alternatively, for more precious samples or for those of limited volume, conventional 5-mm or capillary NMR tubes are usually used, either individually or using a variety of commercially-available sample-tube changers with automatic data acquisition.\nThe large NMR signal arising from water in all biofluids is easily eliminated by using appropriate standard NMR solvent-suppression methods. Absolute concentrations can be obtained if the sample contains an added internal standard of known concentration, or if a standard addition of the analyte of interest is added to the sample, or if the concentration of a substance is known by independent means (e.g., glucose in plasma can be quantified by a conventional biochemical assay). As an example of the observed spectral complexity, a 950 MHz 1H NMR spectrum of rat urine is shown in Fig. 2 .\nThe 1H NMR spectra of blood plasma and serum show broad bands from protein and lipoprotein signals, with sharp peaks from small molecules superimposed on them . Standard NMR-pulse sequences, where the observed peak intensities are edited on the basis of molecular diffusion coefficients or on NMR relaxation times (such as the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo sequence) can be used to select only the contributions from macromolecules, or alternatively to select only the signals from the small-molecule metabolites, respectively. Details of the theory and the practice of NMR-pulse methods can be found in several textbooks (e.g., Claridge ). In addition, practical aspects of their implementation are obtainable from the book by Berger and Braun .\nIdentification of biomarkers can involve all of the armory of analytical physical chemistry, including MS. 1H NMR spectra of urine and other biofluids, even though they are very complex, allow many resonances to be assigned directly based on their chemical shifts, and signal multiplicities, by adding authentic material and by matching with databases of spectra, and further information can be obtained by using spectral editing techniques.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy is useful for increasing signal dispersion and for elucidating the connectivities between signals, thus helping to identify metabolites. These include the 1H-1H 2-D J-resolved experiment, which attenuates the peaks from macromolecules and yields information on the multiplicity and coupling patterns of resonances. A projection of such a spectrum onto the chemical-shift axis yields a fingerprint of peaks from only the most highly mobile small molecules, with all spin-coupling peak multiplicities removed. Other 2-D experiments (COSY and TOCSY) provide 1H-1H spin-spin coupling connectivities, giving information on which hydrogens in a molecule are close in chemical-bond terms. Use of other types of nuclei (e.g., naturally-abundant 13C, or 31P, where it is present) can be important to help assign NMR peaks through inverse-detected heteronuclear correlation NMR experiments. Here, the lower sensitivity or less abundant nucleus NMR spectrum (e.g., 13C) is detected indirectly using the more sensitive/abundant nucleus (1H) by making use of spin-spin interactions (e.g., the one-bond 13C-1H spin-spin coupling). These yield both 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of CH, CH2 and CH3 groups, useful again for identification purposes. There is also a sequence that allows correlation of protons to quaternary carbons based on long-range 13C-1H spin-spin coupling.\nThe development of cryogenic probes where the detector coil and pre-amplifier (but not the samples) are cooled to around 20 K has provided an improvement in spectral signal-to-noise ratios of up to a factor of 5 by reducing the thermal noise in the electronics of the spectrometer. Conversely, because the NMR signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to the square root of the number of co-added scans, shorter data-acquisition times by up to a factor of 25 become possible for the same amount of sample. NMR spectroscopy of biofluids detecting the much less sensitive 13C nuclei, which also only have a natural abundance (1.1%), now becomes feasible because of the increase in signal-to-noise ratio .\nUsing a technique called high-resolution 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, it is possible to acquire high-resolution NMR data from small pieces of intact tissues with no pretreatment . Rapid spinning of the sample (typically at \u223c4\u20136 kHz) at an angle of 54.7\u00b0 relative to the applied magnetic field serves to reduce the loss of information caused by line-broadening effects seen in non-liquid samples, such as tissues (caused by sample heterogeneity, and residual anisotropic NMR parameters that are normally averaged out in free solution where molecules can tumble isotropically and rapidly). MAS-NMR spectroscopy has straightforward, manual sample preparation. NMR spectroscopy on a tissue sample in an MAS experiment is the same as solution-state NMR and all common pulse techniques can be employed in order to study metabolic changes and to perform molecular structure elucidation and molecular dynamics studies. Typical 400 MHz 1H MAS-NMR spectra of various tissues and cell types are shown in Fig. 3 .\nMS has also been widely used in metabolic fingerprinting and metabolite identification, often using tandem-MS methods. Although most studies to date have been on plant extracts and model cell-system extracts , the application of MS to mammalian studies is increasing. In general, prior separation of the complex mixture sample using chromatography is required. MS is inherently considerably more sensitive than NMR spectroscopy, but it is generally necessary to employ different separation techniques (e.g., different LC-column packings) for different classes of substances. Analyte detection is not as universal as for NMR and quantitation by MS in complex mixtures of highly variable composition can be impaired by variable ionization and ion-suppression effects. Some approaches using MS rely on more targeted studies (e.g., by detailed analysis of lipids ).\nFor metabonomics applications on biofluids, such as urine, an LC chromatogram is generated with MS detection, usually using electrospray ionization, and both positive- and negative-ion chromatograms can be measured. Typically, a time-of-flight (TOF) instrument is used with quadrupole focusing, but other studies have used ion-cyclotron resonance MS (ICR-MS) without the prior separation. UPLC is a combination of a smaller reversed-phase packing material and a chromatographic system, operating at higher pressure, around 12,000 psi, giving improved chromatographic peak resolution and increased speed and sensitivity for separation of complex mixtures. Because of the much-improved chromatographic resolution of UPLC, the problem of ion suppression from co-eluting peaks is greatly reduced. A comparison of typical HPLC and UPLC chromatograms with MS detection is shown in Fig. 4 . Such data sets are of course three-dimensional (3D) in nature, being characterized by time, m/z and intensity.\nFor biomarker identification, it is also possible to separate out substances of interest on a larger scale from a complex biofluid sample using techniques such as solid-phase extraction (SPE) or HPLC, often using automated methods. For metabolite identification, directly coupled chromatography-NMR spectroscopy methods can also be used. The most general of these \u201chyphenated\u201d approaches is HPLC-NMR-MS , in which the eluting HPLC peak is split, with parallel analysis by directly-coupled NMR and MS techniques. This can be operated in on-flow, stopped-flow and loop-storage modes, so it can provide the full array of NMR-based and MS-based molecular identification tools. These include 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as MS2 for identification of fragment ions and FT-MS or TOF-MS for accurate mass measurement and hence derivation of molecular empirical formulae.\nAll metabonomics studies result in complex multivariate data sets and these usually require visualization software and chemometric and bioinformatic methods for interpretation and production of biochemical fingerprints that are of diagnostic or other classification value. A second vital stage is to identify the substances causing the diagnosis or the classification, as these are the combination of biomarkers that define the biological or the clinical situation.\nThe initial objective in metabonomics is thus usually to classify a sample based on identification of its detailed spectral patterns, and then to identify those metabolic features responsible for the classification. The approach can also be used for reducing the dimensionality of complex data sets (e.g., by 2D- or 3D-mapping procedures) to enable easy visualization of any clustering of the various samples. Alternatively, in what are known as \u201csupervised\u201d methods, multi-parametric data sets can be modeled so that the class or the quantitative output variable of separate samples (a \u201cvalidation set\u201d) can be predicted based on a series of mathematical models derived from the original data or \u201ctraining set\u201d.\nOne simple technique used extensively in metabonomics is principal components (PCs) analysis (PCA) . Conversion of the data matrix to PCs results in two matrices known as scores and loadings. Scores, the linear combinations of the original variables, are new latent variables, and, in a scores plot, each point represents a single sample spectrum, such that any clustering can be visualized. PC loadings define the way in which the old variables are linearly combined to form the new variables and a loadings plot can be used to identify spectral values responsible for sample clustering. In addition, there are many other visualization (or unsupervised) methods (e.g., non-linear mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis).\nOne widely used supervised method is partial least squares (PLS) , which relates a data matrix containing independent variables from samples (e.g., spectral intensity values) (an X matrix) to a matrix containing dependent variables (e.g., measurements of response) for those samples (a Y matrix). PLS can also be combined with discriminant analysis (DA) to establish the optimal position to place a discriminant surface that best separates classes. It is possible to use such supervised models to provide classification probabilities and quantitative response factors for a wide range of sample types, but, given the strong possibility of chance correlations when the number of descriptors is large, it is important to build and to test such chemometric models using independent training data and validation data sets. Orthogonal signal correction (OSC) can be used to remove irrelevant parts of the data that are uncorrelated with the end-points .\nPCA and PLS use linear combinations of parameters for dimension reduction or classification, but other methods exist (e.g., probabilistic neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning and Bayesian modeling).\nThere remains a strong need to improve the information recovery from metabonomics data sets and to correlate and to integrate results from different data types. Recently, a new method was introduced for identifying multiple NMR peaks from the same molecule in a complex mixture, hence providing a new approach to molecular identification. This is the concept of statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) , which takes advantage of the multi-colinearity of the various intensity variables in a set of spectra (e.g., 1H NMR spectra) to generate a pseudo-2D NMR spectrum that displays the correlation among the intensities of the various peaks across the whole sample. This method is not limited to the usual connectivities that are deducible from standard 2D NMR spectroscopic methods (e.g., TOCSY). Strong correlations between spectral intensities lead to identification of peaks from the same molecule. Added information is available by examining lower correlation coefficients or even negative correlations, since this leads to connections between two or more molecules involved in the same biochemical pathway. In an extension of the method, the combination of STOCSY with supervised chemometrics methods offers a new framework for analysis of metabonomic data. In a first step, a supervised multivariate DA can be used to extract the parts of NMR spectra related to discrimination between two sample classes. This information is then combined with the STOCSY results to help identify the molecules responsible for the metabolic variation. To illustrate the applicability of the method, it has been applied to 1H NMR spectra of urine from a metabonomic study of a model of insulin resistance based on the administration of a carbohydrate diet to three different mice strains, in which a series of metabolites of biological importance could be conclusively assigned and identified using the STOCSY approach . This is illustrated in Fig. 5 , in which the approach has been used to identify the metabolite 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid.\nMore recently, it has been used for a wide variety of NMR applications, including improved visualization of diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy of mixtures , enhancing information recovery and compound identification in on-line HPLC-NMR spectroscopy , identifying drug metabolites in samples collected for epidemiological purposes , identifying biomarkers in toxicity assessment , and investigating the effects of probiotics on model mammalian systems .\nThe approach is not limited to NMR spectra alone and has been extended to other forms of data. It has recently been applied to co-analysis of both NMR and mass spectra from a metabonomic toxicity study . This allowed better assignment of biomarkers of the toxin effect by using the correlated, but complementary, information available from the NMR and mass spectra taken on a whole sample cohort, so it is now possible to find MS ion intensities that correlate with NMR peak intensities and therefore yield complementary information for identifying compounds.\nThe correlation-analysis approach has been extended to co-analysis of NMR spectroscopic with proteomic data in a model of prostate cancer , transcriptomic data in mouse models of diabetes , and genomic data in rat models of cardiovascular disease and obesity .\nIn order to relate therapeutic or toxic effects to normality or to understand biochemical alterations caused by disease, it is necessary to have a good comprehension of what constitutes a normal biochemical profile. A number of studies have used metabonomics in this type of application to identify metabolic differences in experimental animals (e.g., mice and rats) caused by a range of inherent and external factors . Such differences may help explain differential toxicity of drugs between strains and inter-animal variation within a study. Many effects can be distinguished using NMR- and MS-based metabonomics, including male/female differences, wild-type and genetically-modified animal models, age-related changes, estrus-cycle effects in females, diet, diurnal effects, and interspecies differences and similarities. The importance of the symbiotic relationship between mammals and the microfloral populations of their gut has been recognized and studied extensively using microbe-free animals , different animal colonies and parasitic infections in animals .\nMinimization of the occurrence of adverse effects of drugs is one of the most important aims of pharmaceutical R&D, and the pharmaceutical industry is now embracing metabonomics for evaluating the adverse effects of candidate drugs. Metabonomics classification of the target organ or region of toxicity, the biochemical mechanism of that toxin, the identification of combination biomarkers of toxic effect and evaluation of the time-course of the effect (e.g., onset, evolution and regression of toxicity) can all be determined. Going back to the 1980s, there have been many studies using 1H NMR spectroscopy of biofluids to characterize drug toxicity, and the role of NMR-based metabonomics in toxicological evaluation of drugs was reviewed recently . The usefulness of metabonomics for evaluating xenobiotic toxicity effects was recently comprehensively explored by the Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology (COMET). This consortium was formed between five pharmaceutical companies and Imperial College London, UK with the aim of developing methodologies for acquisition and evaluation of metabonomic data generated using 1H NMR spectroscopy of urine and blood serum from rats and mice for pre-clinical toxicological screening of candidate drugs. Feasibility studies revealed the high degree of robustness expected for NMR , there was a high degree of consistency between samples from the various companies, and dose-related effects could be distinguished from inter-site variation.\nNew methodologies for analyzing and classifying the complex data sets had to be developed, and COMET showed that it is possible to construct predictive and informative models of toxicity using NMR-based metabonomic data, delineating the whole time course of toxicity. The successful outcome is evidenced by the databases of spectral and conventional results generated for a wide range of model toxins (147 in total) that served as the basis for computer-based expert systems for toxicity prediction. The project goals of generating comprehensive metabonomic databases (now around 35,000 NMR spectra) and successful and robust multivariate statistical models (expert systems) for prediction of toxicity, initially for liver and kidney toxicity in the rat and mouse, have now been achieved, and the predictive systems and databases have been transferred to the sponsoring companies .\nThere are many examples in the literature (all recently quoted and reviewed in ) on the use of NMR-based metabolic profiling to aid human-disease diagnosis (e.g., the use of plasma to study diabetes, serum for ovarian cancer, plasma for coronary artery disease, CSF for meningitis, brain hemorrhage and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, synovial fluid for osteoarthritis, seminal fluid for male infertility, and urine for drug overdose, renal transplantation and various renal diseases). A promising use of NMR spectroscopy of urine and plasma, as evidenced by the number of publications on the subject, is in diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in children. In addition, tissues themselves can be studied by metabonomics through the MAS technique and there are many published examples, many in cancer.\nA novel integration of proteomic and metabonomic data has been developed and applied to a human tumor xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer . Furthermore, it is now clear that characterizing relationships between genomic and phenotypic variation is an essential step in understanding disease processes, and, to this end, the first real transcriptomic-metabonomic and genomic-metabonomic cross-correlations have been achieved in rodent models of insulin resistance and other metabolic syndrome diseases .\nIt is clear that developments in NMR spectroscopy will continue to provide advances in sensitivity from cryogenic probes and higher magnetic field strengths. Improved identification of metabolites will come from inspection of databases of NMR spectra of standard substances. An increasing use of MS-based analyses in mammalian systems is expected, especially in targeted studies aimed at specific groups of metabolites, and improvements in detection, sensitivity and reliability will undoubtedly be achieved. Given the need for the data sets to provide information on molecular identity, it is unlikely that techniques other than NMR and MS will find widespread use.\nA major initiative is under way to investigate the reporting needs and to make consensual recommendations for standardizing reporting arrangements for metabonomics studies. One initiative was the Standard Metabolic Reporting Structures (SMRS) group (www.smrsgroup.org), which produced a draft policy document covering all aspects of a metabolic study that are recommended for recording, from the origin of a biological sample, the analysis of material from that sample and chemometric and statistical approaches to retrieve information from the sample data; a summary publication has appeared . The various levels and consequent detail for reporting needs, including journal submissions, public databases and regulatory submissions were also addressed. This was followed up with a workshop and a discussion meeting sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health, from which comprehensive actions are taking place (Metabolomics Standards Initiative \u2013 http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net) to define standards in a number of areas relevant to metabonomics and metabolomics. Various working groups have produced reports and publications, that for chemical analyis being the most relevant to this article.\nThe main pharmaceutical areas where metabonomics is already having an impact include validation of animal models of disease, including genetically-modified animals, pre-clinical evaluation candidate drugs in safety studies, assessment of safety in humans in clinical trials and, after product launch, quantitation or ranking of the beneficial effects of pharmaceuticals, improved understanding of the causes of highly sporadic idiosyncratic toxicity of marketed drugs, and patient stratification for clinical trials and drug treatment (pharmacometabonomics). In addition, in terms of disease studies, metabonomics is playing a role in improved, differential diagnosis and prognosis of human diseases, particularly for chronic and degenerative diseases, and for diseases caused by genetic effects. A better understanding of large-scale human-population differences through epidemiological studies is also being achieved. Other applications where major expansion is expected are nutritional studies, sports medicine and life-style studies, including the effects of diet, exercise and stress, and evaluation of the effects of interactions between drugs, and between drugs and diet.\nIf personalized healthcare is to become a reality, an individual\u2019s drug treatments must be tailored so as to achieve maximal efficacy and avoid adverse drug reactions. One of the long-term goals of using pharmacogenomic approaches is to understand the genetic make-up of different individuals (their genetic polymorphisms) and their varying abilities to handle both beneficial and adverse effects of pharmaceuticals.\nAn alternative approach has been developed to understanding inter-subject variability in response to drug treatment, using a combination of multivariate metabolic profiling and chemometrics to predict the metabolism and toxicity of a dosed substance, based solely on analysis and modeling of a pre-dose metabolic profile . Unlike pharmacogenomics, this approach, which has been termed \u2018pharmacometabonomics\u2019, is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences that determine the basal metabolic fingerprint of an individual, since these will also influence the outcome of a chemical intervention. This new approach has been illustrated with studies of the toxicity and the metabolism of compounds with very different modes of action, administered to rats. This field is very likely to expand rapidly.\nIn summary, it is clear that metabonomics will have a major impact in many application areas. The analytical procedures used are stable and robust, and have a high degree of reproducibility, and, although advances will obviously be made in the future, current data will always be readable and interpretable. In contrast to other -omics, metabonomics enjoys a good level of biological reproducibility and the costs per sample and per analyte are low. It has the advantage of not having to preselect analytes, and, through use of biofluids, it is minimally invasive with hypothesis-generation studies being possible. Metabolic biomarkers are identifiable with real biological end-points and provide a global systems interpretation of biological effects, including the interactions between multiple genomes (e.g., humans and their gut microflora). One major potential strength of metabonomics is the possibility that metabolic biomarkers will be more easily used across species than transcriptomic or proteomic biomarkers and this should be important for pharmaceutical studies.\nHowever, metabonomics suffers from the use of multiple analytical technologies, there are questions of the sensitivity and dynamic range of the technologies used, and the data sets are complex. Through the use of chemometrics, it is possible to over-interpret data, but this is easily avoided by correct statistical rigor. At present, the groups using metabonomics are moving towards defining standards for data and operations, and a good start has been made, but there remains a need for the regulatory agencies to be trained in data interpretation and for more well-trained practitioners.\nThe reality of the complexity of disease and the effects of drugs means that biomarker combinations will be the more usual outcome, so there will be many opportunities for metabonomics that are as yet under-explored (e.g., environmental toxicity studies, directing the timing of transcriptomic and proteomic experiments, and deriving theranostic biomarkers). It will surely be an integral part of any multi-omics study, where all the data sets are combined in order to derive an optimum set of biomarkers.\nThe ultimate goal of systems biology is the integration of data acquired from living organisms at gene, protein and metabolite levels. Through the combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabonomics, it is hoped that improved understanding of an organism\u2019s total biology will result, and, with this, better understanding of the causes and the progression of human diseases will ensue.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Molecular biology has recently concentrated on the determination of multiple gene-expression changes at the RNA level, either between subjects, or following drug treatment or other interventions (transcriptomics). Much effort has also been put into determination of multiple protein-expression changes in a cell or tissue (proteomics). The main problem with interpreting transcriptomics and proteomics is often the difficulty of relating observed gene-expression fold changes or protein-level (not activity) changes to conventional disease and pharmaceutically relevant end-points.\nAt the small-molecule metabolite level, similar developments have been taking place, leading to the marked expansion in studies now termed metabonomics and metabolomics . As will be shown, this approach can be used to provide comprehensive and simultaneous systematic profiling of metabolite levels in biofluids and tissues and their systematic and temporal changes, such effects arising not only from control by the host genome but from extended genomes (e.g., those provided by the gut bacteria present in all mammals) and the effects of other environmental factors (e.g., diet, drug therapy and life style). The techniques and applications have been reviewed in a recent book .\nAnimals and man can be considered as \u201csuper-organisms\u201d with an internal ecosystem of diverse symbiotic gut microflora (often with unknown genomes) that have metabolic processes that interact with the host. The complexity of mammalian biological systems and the diverse features that need to be measured to allow \u201comics\u201d data to be fully interpreted have been reviewed recently and novel approaches will be required to measure and to model such co-metabolic processes .\nLong prior to the development of the various \u201comics\u201d approaches, the simultaneous analysis of the plethora of metabolites seen in biological fluids had been carried out largely using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy , but also using mass spectrometry (MS) , and it was shown that these complex data sets could be interpreted using multi-variate statistics .\nMetabonomics studies generally use biofluids or cell or tissue extracts, and these are often easily available. Urine and plasma are obtained essentially non-invasively, so they can be used more easily for disease diagnosis and, in a clinical trials setting, for monitoring drug therapy. However, there is a wide range of fluids that have been studied, including seminal fluids, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, digestive fluids, blister and cyst fluids, lung aspirates and dialysis fluids . In addition, a number of metabonomics studies have used analysis of tissue-biopsy samples and their lipid and aqueous extracts, as well as in vitro cell systems (e.g., Caco-2 cells ), model systems (e.g., yeast ), tumor cells and spheroids , and there is a large literature on plant-metabolism studies .\nThe understanding of molecular biology has seen a dramatic expansion recently with the decoding of the human genome and other genomes, and the integration of gene-expression and proteomic data. However, only metabonomics has the power to provide information on complete living systems at the individual level or the population level, and, for this reason, metabonomics can be seen as the fulcrum of top-down systems biology (rather than the study of single-gene effects, which is a bottom-up approach).\nThe main analytical techniques employed for metabonomic studies are based on NMR spectroscopy and MS. The latter technique generally requires pre-separation of the metabolic components using either gas chromatography (GC) after chemical derivatization, or liquid chromatography (LC), with the newer method of ultra-high-pressure LC (UPLC) being used increasingly. The use of capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to MS has also shown some promise. Other more specialized techniques (e.g., Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and arrayed electrochemical detection) have been used in some cases. The main limitation of the use of these latter techniques is the low level of detailed molecular identification that can be achieved, so MS is also usually employed for metabolite identification.\nNMR spectroscopy provides detailed information on molecular structure, for pure compounds and in complex mixtures, but it can also be used to probe metabolite molecular dynamics and mobility through the interpretation of NMR spin-relaxation times and by the determination of molecular diffusion coefficients. Commercially available instruments up to an observation frequency for 1H of 950 MHz are available (with higher frequencies on the way), and, for small-molecule studies, the increased sensitivity and dispersion that results are of great value and there are no potential disadvantages, as could be the situation for macromolecules. Shown in Fig. 1 is the recently installed 800 MHz NMR spectrometer at Imperial College London that is used extensively for biomarker identification in metabonomics studies.\nAutomatic sample preparation involves simply buffering (in the case of urine) and addition of D2O as a magnetic field lock signal for the spectrometer, and standard NMR spectra typically take only a few minutes to acquire using robotic flow-injection methods. For large-scale studies, bar-coded vials containing the biofluid can be used and the contents of these can be transferred and prepared for analysis using robotic liquid-handling technology into 96-well plates under control of a laboratory information management system (LIMS). Currently, using such approaches, well over 100 samples per day can be measured on one spectrometer. Alternatively, for more precious samples or for those of limited volume, conventional 5-mm or capillary NMR tubes are usually used, either individually or using a variety of commercially-available sample-tube changers with automatic data acquisition.\nThe large NMR signal arising from water in all biofluids is easily eliminated by using appropriate standard NMR solvent-suppression methods. Absolute concentrations can be obtained if the sample contains an added internal standard of known concentration, or if a standard addition of the analyte of interest is added to the sample, or if the concentration of a substance is known by independent means (e.g., glucose in plasma can be quantified by a conventional biochemical assay). As an example of the observed spectral complexity, a 950 MHz 1H NMR spectrum of rat urine is shown in Fig. 2 .\nThe 1H NMR spectra of blood plasma and serum show broad bands from protein and lipoprotein signals, with sharp peaks from small molecules superimposed on them . Standard NMR-pulse sequences, where the observed peak intensities are edited on the basis of molecular diffusion coefficients or on NMR relaxation times (such as the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo sequence) can be used to select only the contributions from macromolecules, or alternatively to select only the signals from the small-molecule metabolites, respectively. Details of the theory and the practice of NMR-pulse methods can be found in several textbooks (e.g., Claridge ). In addition, practical aspects of their implementation are obtainable from the book by Berger and Braun .\nIdentification of biomarkers can involve all of the armory of analytical physical chemistry, including MS. 1H NMR spectra of urine and other biofluids, even though they are very complex, allow many resonances to be assigned directly based on their chemical shifts, and signal multiplicities, by adding authentic material and by matching with databases of spectra, and further information can be obtained by using spectral editing techniques.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy is useful for increasing signal dispersion and for elucidating the connectivities between signals, thus helping to identify metabolites. These include the 1H-1H 2-D J-resolved experiment, which attenuates the peaks from macromolecules and yields information on the multiplicity and coupling patterns of resonances. A projection of such a spectrum onto the chemical-shift axis yields a fingerprint of peaks from only the most highly mobile small molecules, with all spin-coupling peak multiplicities removed. Other 2-D experiments (COSY and TOCSY) provide 1H-1H spin-spin coupling connectivities, giving information on which hydrogens in a molecule are close in chemical-bond terms. Use of other types of nuclei (e.g., naturally-abundant 13C, or 31P, where it is present) can be important to help assign NMR peaks through inverse-detected heteronuclear correlation NMR experiments. Here, the lower sensitivity or less abundant nucleus NMR spectrum (e.g., 13C) is detected indirectly using the more sensitive/abundant nucleus (1H) by making use of spin-spin interactions (e.g., the one-bond 13C-1H spin-spin coupling). These yield both 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of CH, CH2 and CH3 groups, useful again for identification purposes. There is also a sequence that allows correlation of protons to quaternary carbons based on long-range 13C-1H spin-spin coupling.\nThe development of cryogenic probes where the detector coil and pre-amplifier (but not the samples) are cooled to around 20 K has provided an improvement in spectral signal-to-noise ratios of up to a factor of 5 by reducing the thermal noise in the electronics of the spectrometer. Conversely, because the NMR signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to the square root of the number of co-added scans, shorter data-acquisition times by up to a factor of 25 become possible for the same amount of sample. NMR spectroscopy of biofluids detecting the much less sensitive 13C nuclei, which also only have a natural abundance (1.1%), now becomes feasible because of the increase in signal-to-noise ratio .\nUsing a technique called high-resolution 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, it is possible to acquire high-resolution NMR data from small pieces of intact tissues with no pretreatment . Rapid spinning of the sample (typically at \u223c4\u20136 kHz) at an angle of 54.7\u00b0 relative to the applied magnetic field serves to reduce the loss of information caused by line-broadening effects seen in non-liquid samples, such as tissues (caused by sample heterogeneity, and residual anisotropic NMR parameters that are normally averaged out in free solution where molecules can tumble isotropically and rapidly). MAS-NMR spectroscopy has straightforward, manual sample preparation. NMR spectroscopy on a tissue sample in an MAS experiment is the same as solution-state NMR and all common pulse techniques can be employed in order to study metabolic changes and to perform molecular structure elucidation and molecular dynamics studies. Typical 400 MHz 1H MAS-NMR spectra of various tissues and cell types are shown in Fig. 3 .\nMS has also been widely used in metabolic fingerprinting and metabolite identification, often using tandem-MS methods. Although most studies to date have been on plant extracts and model cell-system extracts , the application of MS to mammalian studies is increasing. In general, prior separation of the complex mixture sample using chromatography is required. MS is inherently considerably more sensitive than NMR spectroscopy, but it is generally necessary to employ different separation techniques (e.g., different LC-column packings) for different classes of substances. Analyte detection is not as universal as for NMR and quantitation by MS in complex mixtures of highly variable composition can be impaired by variable ionization and ion-suppression effects. Some approaches using MS rely on more targeted studies (e.g., by detailed analysis of lipids ).\nFor metabonomics applications on biofluids, such as urine, an LC chromatogram is generated with MS detection, usually using electrospray ionization, and both positive- and negative-ion chromatograms can be measured. Typically, a time-of-flight (TOF) instrument is used with quadrupole focusing, but other studies have used ion-cyclotron resonance MS (ICR-MS) without the prior separation. UPLC is a combination of a smaller reversed-phase packing material and a chromatographic system, operating at higher pressure, around 12,000 psi, giving improved chromatographic peak resolution and increased speed and sensitivity for separation of complex mixtures. Because of the much-improved chromatographic resolution of UPLC, the problem of ion suppression from co-eluting peaks is greatly reduced. A comparison of typical HPLC and UPLC chromatograms with MS detection is shown in Fig. 4 . Such data sets are of course three-dimensional (3D) in nature, being characterized by time, m/z and intensity.\nFor biomarker identification, it is also possible to separate out substances of interest on a larger scale from a complex biofluid sample using techniques such as solid-phase extraction (SPE) or HPLC, often using automated methods. For metabolite identification, directly coupled chromatography-NMR spectroscopy methods can also be used. The most general of these \u201chyphenated\u201d approaches is HPLC-NMR-MS , in which the eluting HPLC peak is split, with parallel analysis by directly-coupled NMR and MS techniques. This can be operated in on-flow, stopped-flow and loop-storage modes, so it can provide the full array of NMR-based and MS-based molecular identification tools. These include 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as MS2 for identification of fragment ions and FT-MS or TOF-MS for accurate mass measurement and hence derivation of molecular empirical formulae.\nAll metabonomics studies result in complex multivariate data sets and these usually require visualization software and chemometric and bioinformatic methods for interpretation and production of biochemical fingerprints that are of diagnostic or other classification value. A second vital stage is to identify the substances causing the diagnosis or the classification, as these are the combination of biomarkers that define the biological or the clinical situation.\nThe initial objective in metabonomics is thus usually to classify a sample based on identification of its detailed spectral patterns, and then to identify those metabolic features responsible for the classification. The approach can also be used for reducing the dimensionality of complex data sets (e.g., by 2D- or 3D-mapping procedures) to enable easy visualization of any clustering of the various samples. Alternatively, in what are known as \u201csupervised\u201d methods, multi-parametric data sets can be modeled so that the class or the quantitative output variable of separate samples (a \u201cvalidation set\u201d) can be predicted based on a series of mathematical models derived from the original data or \u201ctraining set\u201d.\nOne simple technique used extensively in metabonomics is principal components (PCs) analysis (PCA) . Conversion of the data matrix to PCs results in two matrices known as scores and loadings. Scores, the linear combinations of the original variables, are new latent variables, and, in a scores plot, each point represents a single sample spectrum, such that any clustering can be visualized. PC loadings define the way in which the old variables are linearly combined to form the new variables and a loadings plot can be used to identify spectral values responsible for sample clustering. In addition, there are many other visualization (or unsupervised) methods (e.g., non-linear mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis).\nOne widely used supervised method is partial least squares (PLS) , which relates a data matrix containing independent variables from samples (e.g., spectral intensity values) (an X matrix) to a matrix containing dependent variables (e.g., measurements of response) for those samples (a Y matrix). PLS can also be combined with discriminant analysis (DA) to establish the optimal position to place a discriminant surface that best separates classes. It is possible to use such supervised models to provide classification probabilities and quantitative response factors for a wide range of sample types, but, given the strong possibility of chance correlations when the number of descriptors is large, it is important to build and to test such chemometric models using independent training data and validation data sets. Orthogonal signal correction (OSC) can be used to remove irrelevant parts of the data that are uncorrelated with the end-points .\nPCA and PLS use linear combinations of parameters for dimension reduction or classification, but other methods exist (e.g., probabilistic neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning and Bayesian modeling).\nThere remains a strong need to improve the information recovery from metabonomics data sets and to correlate and to integrate results from different data types. Recently, a new method was introduced for identifying multiple NMR peaks from the same molecule in a complex mixture, hence providing a new approach to molecular identification. This is the concept of statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) , which takes advantage of the multi-colinearity of the various intensity variables in a set of spectra (e.g., 1H NMR spectra) to generate a pseudo-2D NMR spectrum that displays the correlation among the intensities of the various peaks across the whole sample. This method is not limited to the usual connectivities that are deducible from standard 2D NMR spectroscopic methods (e.g., TOCSY). Strong correlations between spectral intensities lead to identification of peaks from the same molecule. Added information is available by examining lower correlation coefficients or even negative correlations, since this leads to connections between two or more molecules involved in the same biochemical pathway. In an extension of the method, the combination of STOCSY with supervised chemometrics methods offers a new framework for analysis of metabonomic data. In a first step, a supervised multivariate DA can be used to extract the parts of NMR spectra related to discrimination between two sample classes. This information is then combined with the STOCSY results to help identify the molecules responsible for the metabolic variation. To illustrate the applicability of the method, it has been applied to 1H NMR spectra of urine from a metabonomic study of a model of insulin resistance based on the administration of a carbohydrate diet to three different mice strains, in which a series of metabolites of biological importance could be conclusively assigned and identified using the STOCSY approach . This is illustrated in Fig. 5 , in which the approach has been used to identify the metabolite 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid.\nMore recently, it has been used for a wide variety of NMR applications, including improved visualization of diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy of mixtures , enhancing information recovery and compound identification in on-line HPLC-NMR spectroscopy , identifying drug metabolites in samples collected for epidemiological purposes , identifying biomarkers in toxicity assessment , and investigating the effects of probiotics on model mammalian systems .\nThe approach is not limited to NMR spectra alone and has been extended to other forms of data. It has recently been applied to co-analysis of both NMR and mass spectra from a metabonomic toxicity study . This allowed better assignment of biomarkers of the toxin effect by using the correlated, but complementary, information available from the NMR and mass spectra taken on a whole sample cohort, so it is now possible to find MS ion intensities that correlate with NMR peak intensities and therefore yield complementary information for identifying compounds.\nThe correlation-analysis approach has been extended to co-analysis of NMR spectroscopic with proteomic data in a model of prostate cancer , transcriptomic data in mouse models of diabetes , and genomic data in rat models of cardiovascular disease and obesity .\nIn order to relate therapeutic or toxic effects to normality or to understand biochemical alterations caused by disease, it is necessary to have a good comprehension of what constitutes a normal biochemical profile. A number of studies have used metabonomics in this type of application to identify metabolic differences in experimental animals (e.g., mice and rats) caused by a range of inherent and external factors . Such differences may help explain differential toxicity of drugs between strains and inter-animal variation within a study. Many effects can be distinguished using NMR- and MS-based metabonomics, including male/female differences, wild-type and genetically-modified animal models, age-related changes, estrus-cycle effects in females, diet, diurnal effects, and interspecies differences and similarities. The importance of the symbiotic relationship between mammals and the microfloral populations of their gut has been recognized and studied extensively using microbe-free animals , different animal colonies and parasitic infections in animals .\nMinimization of the occurrence of adverse effects of drugs is one of the most important aims of pharmaceutical R&D, and the pharmaceutical industry is now embracing metabonomics for evaluating the adverse effects of candidate drugs. Metabonomics classification of the target organ or region of toxicity, the biochemical mechanism of that toxin, the identification of combination biomarkers of toxic effect and evaluation of the time-course of the effect (e.g., onset, evolution and regression of toxicity) can all be determined. Going back to the 1980s, there have been many studies using 1H NMR spectroscopy of biofluids to characterize drug toxicity, and the role of NMR-based metabonomics in toxicological evaluation of drugs was reviewed recently . The usefulness of metabonomics for evaluating xenobiotic toxicity effects was recently comprehensively explored by the Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology (COMET). This consortium was formed between five pharmaceutical companies and Imperial College London, UK with the aim of developing methodologies for acquisition and evaluation of metabonomic data generated using 1H NMR spectroscopy of urine and blood serum from rats and mice for pre-clinical toxicological screening of candidate drugs. Feasibility studies revealed the high degree of robustness expected for NMR , there was a high degree of consistency between samples from the various companies, and dose-related effects could be distinguished from inter-site variation.\nNew methodologies for analyzing and classifying the complex data sets had to be developed, and COMET showed that it is possible to construct predictive and informative models of toxicity using NMR-based metabonomic data, delineating the whole time course of toxicity. The successful outcome is evidenced by the databases of spectral and conventional results generated for a wide range of model toxins (147 in total) that served as the basis for computer-based expert systems for toxicity prediction. The project goals of generating comprehensive metabonomic databases (now around 35,000 NMR spectra) and successful and robust multivariate statistical models (expert systems) for prediction of toxicity, initially for liver and kidney toxicity in the rat and mouse, have now been achieved, and the predictive systems and databases have been transferred to the sponsoring companies .\nThere are many examples in the literature (all recently quoted and reviewed in ) on the use of NMR-based metabolic profiling to aid human-disease diagnosis (e.g., the use of plasma to study diabetes, serum for ovarian cancer, plasma for coronary artery disease, CSF for meningitis, brain hemorrhage and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, synovial fluid for osteoarthritis, seminal fluid for male infertility, and urine for drug overdose, renal transplantation and various renal diseases). A promising use of NMR spectroscopy of urine and plasma, as evidenced by the number of publications on the subject, is in diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in children. In addition, tissues themselves can be studied by metabonomics through the MAS technique and there are many published examples, many in cancer.\nA novel integration of proteomic and metabonomic data has been developed and applied to a human tumor xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer . Furthermore, it is now clear that characterizing relationships between genomic and phenotypic variation is an essential step in understanding disease processes, and, to this end, the first real transcriptomic-metabonomic and genomic-metabonomic cross-correlations have been achieved in rodent models of insulin resistance and other metabolic syndrome diseases .\nIt is clear that developments in NMR spectroscopy will continue to provide advances in sensitivity from cryogenic probes and higher magnetic field strengths. Improved identification of metabolites will come from inspection of databases of NMR spectra of standard substances. An increasing use of MS-based analyses in mammalian systems is expected, especially in targeted studies aimed at specific groups of metabolites, and improvements in detection, sensitivity and reliability will undoubtedly be achieved. Given the need for the data sets to provide information on molecular identity, it is unlikely that techniques other than NMR and MS will find widespread use.\nA major initiative is under way to investigate the reporting needs and to make consensual recommendations for standardizing reporting arrangements for metabonomics studies. One initiative was the Standard Metabolic Reporting Structures (SMRS) group (www.smrsgroup.org), which produced a draft policy document covering all aspects of a metabolic study that are recommended for recording, from the origin of a biological sample, the analysis of material from that sample and chemometric and statistical approaches to retrieve information from the sample data; a summary publication has appeared . The various levels and consequent detail for reporting needs, including journal submissions, public databases and regulatory submissions were also addressed. This was followed up with a workshop and a discussion meeting sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health, from which comprehensive actions are taking place (Metabolomics Standards Initiative \u2013 http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net) to define standards in a number of areas relevant to metabonomics and metabolomics. Various working groups have produced reports and publications, that for chemical analyis being the most relevant to this article.\nThe main pharmaceutical areas where metabonomics is already having an impact include validation of animal models of disease, including genetically-modified animals, pre-clinical evaluation candidate drugs in safety studies, assessment of safety in humans in clinical trials and, after product launch, quantitation or ranking of the beneficial effects of pharmaceuticals, improved understanding of the causes of highly sporadic idiosyncratic toxicity of marketed drugs, and patient stratification for clinical trials and drug treatment (pharmacometabonomics). In addition, in terms of disease studies, metabonomics is playing a role in improved, differential diagnosis and prognosis of human diseases, particularly for chronic and degenerative diseases, and for diseases caused by genetic effects. A better understanding of large-scale human-population differences through epidemiological studies is also being achieved. Other applications where major expansion is expected are nutritional studies, sports medicine and life-style studies, including the effects of diet, exercise and stress, and evaluation of the effects of interactions between drugs, and between drugs and diet.\nIf personalized healthcare is to become a reality, an individual\u2019s drug treatments must be tailored so as to achieve maximal efficacy and avoid adverse drug reactions. One of the long-term goals of using pharmacogenomic approaches is to understand the genetic make-up of different individuals (their genetic polymorphisms) and their varying abilities to handle both beneficial and adverse effects of pharmaceuticals.\nAn alternative approach has been developed to understanding inter-subject variability in response to drug treatment, using a combination of multivariate metabolic profiling and chemometrics to predict the metabolism and toxicity of a dosed substance, based solely on analysis and modeling of a pre-dose metabolic profile . Unlike pharmacogenomics, this approach, which has been termed \u2018pharmacometabonomics\u2019, is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences that determine the basal metabolic fingerprint of an individual, since these will also influence the outcome of a chemical intervention. This new approach has been illustrated with studies of the toxicity and the metabolism of compounds with very different modes of action, administered to rats. This field is very likely to expand rapidly.\nIn summary, it is clear that metabonomics will have a major impact in many application areas. The analytical procedures used are stable and robust, and have a high degree of reproducibility, and, although advances will obviously be made in the future, current data will always be readable and interpretable. In contrast to other -omics, metabonomics enjoys a good level of biological reproducibility and the costs per sample and per analyte are low. It has the advantage of not having to preselect analytes, and, through use of biofluids, it is minimally invasive with hypothesis-generation studies being possible. Metabolic biomarkers are identifiable with real biological end-points and provide a global systems interpretation of biological effects, including the interactions between multiple genomes (e.g., humans and their gut microflora). One major potential strength of metabonomics is the possibility that metabolic biomarkers will be more easily used across species than transcriptomic or proteomic biomarkers and this should be important for pharmaceutical studies.\nHowever, metabonomics suffers from the use of multiple analytical technologies, there are questions of the sensitivity and dynamic range of the technologies used, and the data sets are complex. Through the use of chemometrics, it is possible to over-interpret data, but this is easily avoided by correct statistical rigor. At present, the groups using metabonomics are moving towards defining standards for data and operations, and a good start has been made, but there remains a need for the regulatory agencies to be trained in data interpretation and for more well-trained practitioners.\nThe reality of the complexity of disease and the effects of drugs means that biomarker combinations will be the more usual outcome, so there will be many opportunities for metabonomics that are as yet under-explored (e.g., environmental toxicity studies, directing the timing of transcriptomic and proteomic experiments, and deriving theranostic biomarkers). It will surely be an integral part of any multi-omics study, where all the data sets are combined in order to derive an optimum set of biomarkers.\nThe ultimate goal of systems biology is the integration of data acquired from living organisms at gene, protein and metabolite levels. Through the combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabonomics, it is hoped that improved understanding of an organism\u2019s total biology will result, and, with this, better understanding of the causes and the progression of human diseases will ensue."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThe electrochemical and optical quantitative analysis of \u03c0-conjugated polymer ultrathin films upon oxidation/reduction and doping/dedoping is of great interest to a number of applications. This includes electrochromic displays , battery electrodes , sensors, and others. Because of the many factors affecting the transition between the doped and dedoped states of these polymer films, it is very difficult to obtain the quantitative analysis of each electrochemical event. A number of experimental in situ techniques on the doping/dedoping process of conjugated polymers has been introduced such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) , FTIR , scanning probe microscopy (SPM) , etc.\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy has become a widely accepted method for the characterization and study of ultrathin films, interfaces and kinetic processes at surfaces . The combination of SPR with electrochemical measurements has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for the simultaneous characterization and manipulation of electrode/electrolyte interfaces . With electrochemical-SPR measurements, the gold substrate that carries the optical surface mode is simultaneously used as the working electrode in the electrochemical experiments. One advantage of using the ESPR technique is that the electrochemical and optical properties are obtained simultaneously from films on the nanometer thickness scale. Recently, the ESPR technique has been applied also for the characterization of a variety of conducting polymer films . This involved the in situ monitoring of the film swelling/shrinking and the electrochromic properties during electropolymerization or anion doping/de-doping. The ESPR technique has also been combined with surface plasmon field enhanced light scattering (SPFELS) and the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique for the characterization of conducting polymer films. A first attempt to combine the QCM/SPR with electrochemical measurements was recently reported by Bailey et al. Attempts to combine SPR/SPFELS with the electropolymerization of conducting polymers have also been recently described by our group . We investigated the electrochemical process of polyaniline using the combined technique to obtain information on the morphological transition corresponding to the electrochemical and dielectric properties during in-situ electropolymerization.\nPolyaniline (PANI) has been known and studied extensively since the 1980s . The interest in this material and its derivatives is mainly due to its interesting electrical and optical properties together with its chemical tunability, ease of derivatization, solubility in a variety of solvents, processability into fibers and films, and its stability. During the past two decades, the chemical and physical properties of polyaniline have been studied extensively under different conditions and, together with polypyrrole, this material has become one of the most popular conducting polymers. A complete review of the tremendous advances in the chemistry, electrochemistry, physics, theory, and processing of polyaniline has been given by MacDiarmid . Polyaniline has three main stable oxidation states: the fully reduced \u201cleucoemeraldine\u201d form, the 50% oxidized \u201cemeraldine\u201d form, and the fully oxidized \u201cpernigraniline\u201d form. Each of these can exist in the form of its base or in the form of its protonated (doped) salt. Oxidative doping of the \u201cleucoemeraldine\u201d or protonic acid doping of the \u201cemeraldine\u201d produces the conducting form, with an increase in conductivity, which can reach up to 10 orders of magnitude; the conductivity of the emeraldine salt can vary between 0.5 and 400 S/cm depending on the preparation .\nIn this study, the quantitative analysis of an ultrathin polyaniline film during the oxidation/reduction and the doping/dedoping cycles is reported using ESPR and EQCM techniques. First, the electropolymerization process is investigated. The deposition process as monitored by the QCM allowed for the determination of the amount of charge transferred to each monomer during the electropolymerization. The SPR reflectivity curve during the electropolymerization strongly depends on the dielectric constant of the deposited polyaniline film. Upon oxidation and reduction and upon doping and dedoping, the polyaniline films undergo a substantial increase and decrease, respectively, in conductivity. These changes occur simultaneously with significant changes in the dielectric constants and the thickness of the films and hence, their optical behavior as probed by SPR and QCM. The film properties, i.e., thickness, real part, and imaginary part of the dielectric constant upon doping/dedoping could be determined quantitatively by these techniques.\nAniline and sulfuric acid were purchased and used as received from Aldrich and Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, respectively.\nAll potentiostatic and cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using a one-compartment, three-electrode cell driven by an EG & G PAR potentiostat (Model 263A). In all the measurements, the working electrodes consisted of gold films (d\u223c50 nm) vacuum evaporated unto an LaSFN9 glass substrate (with an adhesion layer of 2 nm Cr, previously evaporated on glass). The counter electrode was a platinum wire and the reference an Ag|AgCl 3 M NaCl aqueous electrode. All the potentials reported in this paper are relative to this reference electrode. The solutions were carefully purged with nitrogen.\nThe SPR set-up combines the three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Kretschmann configuration for the excitation of surface plasmons. Details of this set-up can be found elsewhere . Surface plasmons are excited by reflecting p-polarized laser light off the Au-coated base of the prism. The excitation sources employed were two different He\u2013Ne lasers: \u03bb=632.8 and 1152 nm. Kinetic measurements were performed in order to monitor the formation of the polyaniline film and the oxidation/reduction and doping/dedoping properties of the deposited polyaniline thin film via reflectivity changes as a function of time. Angular measurements were also performed by scanning an incident angle range while the potential was held constant. For these experiments, the gold film thickness was chosen for optimum excitation of the surface plasmons with both wavelengths (42\u201345 nm). The electrode surface area was 0.785 cm2.\nCommercial 5 MHz AT-cut quartz crystals with Au electrodes and a crystal holder (Maxtek Inc., USA) were used. The front electrode of the crystal was used as the working area and the back electrode was grounded, and both electrodes were connected at the back side to an impedance analyzer. On both sides of the crystal, O-rings were used to prevent leakage. Details concerning this set-up can be found elsewhere . The crystals were plasma cleaned before measurement. An impedance analyzer (HP E5100A, 10 kHz\u2013300 MHz, Agilent Technologies) was used in the measurement. From the impedance analysis, both the shift in frequency and the change in the half-band-half width (HBHW) are obtained from fits of the resonance curves to the conductance spectra. The latter quantity is related to dissipation. In order to separate the rf voltage (network analyzer) and the dc voltage (potentiostat), a combination of a capacitor and an inductance was used as described elsewhere . In EQCM, the electrode surface area was determined to be 1.33 cm2.\nIn order to complement the information obtained by the ESPR and the EQCM experiments, transmittance measurements were carried out with both lasers during the potential cycling (cyclic voltammetry), between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. In this case, the gold film thickness was reduced to 20 nm to allow transmission measurements on the glass substrates.\nElectrochemical polymerization of aniline on the gold surface was achieved by applying potential cycling between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) obtained during the electropolymerization is shown in Fig. 1a up to the seventh cycle. Similar conditions in aqueous H2SO4 for the potential range described, has been used by many groups . As reported previously, the first redox process (ca. 0.22 V in the positive scan and 0.05 V in the negative scan) corresponds to the electron transfer from/to the electrodeposited polyaniline film. In order to compensate the charge of the polyaniline film, anion transport from/to the electrolyte solution, i.e., anion doping and dedoping , should occur. This phenomenon is responsible for the dramatic change in the conductivity of the PANI film. The electrodeposition of polyaniline on the Au electrode proceeds via a radical cation mechanism. The second redox process (ca. 0.5 and 0.45 V, for the oxidation and reduction, respectively) probably corresponds to side reactions such as decomposition of the polymer. The large currents observed at the positive end of the CV are due to the superposition of two distinct processes: one is the electron transfer from the PANI film corresponding to the oxidation of the PANI film and the other is the electron transfer from the aniline monomer to the electrode corresponding to the oxidation of the aniline monomer to produce a precursor for the PANI film. A series of angular SPR curves taken after each potential cycle are shown in Fig. 1b. These scans were measured in the solution at open circuit potential (ocp \u2248 0.15 V). Shifts of the dip angles in the SPR curves were observed indicating that polyaniline was deposited onto the gold film electrode during each potential cycle.\nThe in situ formation of the PANI film on the gold electrode surface was monitored by the measurement of the charge transferred, by QCM and by SPR. Fig. 2 shows the complex frequency change during electropolymerization by cycling the potential between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. Each arrow shows the starting point of each potential cycle, i.e., \u22120.2 V. In the QCM measurements, the Sauerbrey-approximation was used for the analysis of the frequency shifts, stating that the frequency shift is mostly caused by deposition of mass on the crystal surface. Thus one obtains: \u0394f/f\u2248\u2212\u0394m/mq=\u2212\u0394m2f0/Zq, with \u0394f the frequency shift, f the frequency, f 0 the fundamental frequency, \u0394m the change in areal mass density for the film, m q=Z q/(2f 0) the areal mass density of the quartz plate, and Z q=8.8 \u00d7 106 kg m\u22122 s\u22121 the acoustic impedance of the AT-cut quartz crystal. The Sauerbrey approximation does not account for viscous losses or viscoelastic effects. In air, such viscoelastic effects scale as the cube of the film thickness and can be neglected. In liquids this is not the case. Because the liquid exerts a lateral stress onto the moving upper surface of the film, there are viscoelastic effects which scale linearly with the mass. This leads to a modified Sauerbrey equation, which is \u0394f+i\u0394\u0393f\u2248\u2212\u0394mmq1\u2212Zq2Zf2\u221212\u03c0if\u03c1l\u03b7lZq2 \u2248\u2212\u0394mmq1\u22122\u03c0if\u03c1l\u03b7lZf2 =\u2212\u0394mmq1\u2212Jf2\u03c0if\u03c1l\u03b7l\u03c1f, where \u03c1 l is the density of the liquid, \u03b7 l is the viscosity of the liquid, Z f is the acoustic impedance of the film, \u03c1 f is the density of the film, and J f=J f \u2032\u2212iJ f\u2033 is the complex compliance of the film. In the second line the relation Z q\u226bZ f (film is softer than quartz plate) has been used. Note that the above expression is only the first term of a Taylor expansion in the film mass \u0394m. More complicated equations apply for films with a thickness comparable to the wavelength of sound . For the analysis of conventional QCM data, the above equation is of limited use because it does not allow for a separation of mass effects and viscoelastic effects (the second term in the curly brackets). One defines a \u201cSauerbrey mass\u201d which is the true mass times the unknown correction factor in curly brackets. If, on the other hand, the bandwidth (HBHW) is available, it can be interpreted in the frame of this equation. The ratio of \u0394\u0393 and \u2212\u0394f should be independent of mass. This is indeed the case for our data, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The quantity \u2212\u0394\u0393/\u0394f corresponds to the ratio of the imaginary and the real part of the curly bracket, namely \u2212\u0394\u0393\u0394f\u2248J\u2032f\u03c1f/2\u03c0f\u03c1l\u03b7l\u2212J\u2033f. The above equation allows for some further conclusions. Assuming \u03c1 f\u2248\u03c1 l the first term in the denominator is of the order of the viscous compliance of the liquid. Further assuming that the liquid is much softer than the film, J f\u2033\u226a1/(2\u03c0f\u03b7) (a safe assumption for most polymeric films) one reaches the conclusion \u0394\u0393\u0394f\u2248J\u2032f2\u03c0f\u03b7l\u2248J\u2032f/[30MPa\u22121], where \u03b7 l\u224810\u22123 Pa s and f=5 \u00d7 106 has been used in the second line. The quantity \u2212\u0394\u0393/\u0394f therefore provides a measure of the elastic compliance of the films. Note that this interpretation contradicts simple intuition to some degree: while one would naively associate a shift in bandwidth to a dissipation inside a film (given by J\u2033, the detailed derivation shows that it is actually the elastic compliance, J \u2032, which is measured.\nAgain, in liquids a modified Sauerbrey equation holds, which is different from the dry case in two respects: first, the mass, \u0394m includes the trapped liquid. Second, there are viscoelastic corrections as given by the curly bracket in Eq. (1). As for the frequency shift, nothing can be learned because the elastic correction is inseparable from the effect of the (unknown) mass. One can, however, extract information from the bandwidth. Making some assumptions, the bandwidth can be used to estimate the elastic compliance, J \u2032, of the film.\nThe application of this formalism to our data is illustrated in this Figure. Fig. 2(a) shows the raw data. \u2212\u0394f and \u0394\u0393 mostly go in parallel, but not quite. During every positive scan, the ratio \u2212\u0394\u0393/\u0394f drops slightly (Fig. 2(b)). During every negative scan, it increases again. This behavior is largely independent of thickness (Fig. 2(c), the \u201cD\u2013f-plot\u201d, where \u201cD\u201d stands for \u201cdissipation\u201d). The above quantitative discussion suggests that the (average) elastic compliance of the film is in the range of 10 MPa. It drops slightly during a positive scan and recovers during a negative scan. One possibility for this is that the PANI film becomes more porous by de-doping but recovers by doping. Shown in Fig. 3(a) are the mass change as a function of time during the seven electropolymerization cycles and corresponding SPR minimum angle shifts measured after each potential cycle. Each arrow shows the starting point of each potential cycle, i.e. \u22120.2 V. In observing the mass change, the increase in each of the cycles mostly corresponds to the oxidation of aniline to form the polyaniline film and the doping of anions into the deposited polyaniline film. The decrease of the curve is mostly due to the dedoping of the anions from the deposited polyaniline film. The trace of the SPR minimum angle shift was similar to the mass change at \u22120.2 V, i.e., at the end of each potential cycle. This indicates that the optical thickness corresponds to the acoustic mass. The kinetic measurements for SPR were performed at a fixed angle, 58.0\u00b0 slightly below the angle of the reflectivity minimum (see Fig. 1(b)) of the blank gold substrate as shown in Fig. 3(b). In the kinetic measurement, the behavior of the reflectivity shows a large difference with mass change. In the case of the SPR reflectivity, the curve is very sensitive to the thickness, the real (\u03b5 \u2032) and the imaginary (\u03b5\u2033) parts of the dielectric constant. The increase in reflectivity below about +0.2 V was seen in the figure whereas no increase was observed in the mass. This clearly indicates that the dielectric constant changes dramatically in this potential range (\u22120.2 to +0.2 V). Fig. 3(c) shows the current efficiency, \u0394m/\u0394Q during the electropolymerization process. From this plot, it was found that the current efficiency increases with time. This property is also seen in the change of the mass as a function of charge transferred as shown in the inset. In EQCM measurements, the areal mass density m f during electropolymerization is related to the charge density passed Q, on the other hand, it also contributes to the generation of solute oligomer . In the case of electropolymerization for the conducting polymer, the theoretical value of the current efficiency, m f/Q is calculated from, mfQ=(MM\u22122MH)+xAMA(2+xA)F, where M M, M A, and M H are the molar masses of the monomer, the incorporated anion, and hydrogen. The quantity x A is the doping level equal to the ratio of the number of moles of inserted anion to that of monomer group in the film. F is the Faraday constant, 96 485 C mol\u22121. The incorporation of water molecules and neutral salts which can cause apparently higher \u0394m/\u0394Q values, were not included in this model. Assuming x A=0.4, the theoretical current efficiency \u0394m/\u0394Q is expected to be 0.952 \u03bcg/mC. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the value found experimentally, was at first, much smaller than the theoretical value, and then finally was much larger (the ratio of experimentally determined \u0394m/\u0394Q exp/theoretical current efficiency \u0394m/\u0394Q theo: 48.6 % after seven cycles) than for the initial potential cycles of electropolymerization (17.3% after 1 cycle). This indicates that a number of side reactions, which do not correspond to a mass increase, e.g., the formation of oligomers, accompany the ultrathin film formation .\nThe cyclic voltammetry curve of a deposited PANI film in monomer-free solution is shown in Fig. 4(a) . The cyclic voltammetry was scanned between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in a monomer-free 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. As mentioned before, the first redox peak (A, A\u2032) is commonly assumed to correspond to the electron transfer from/to the PANI film. In order to compensate the charge of the PANI film, anion doping/dedoping of the polyaniline film occurs. This is also seen in the EQCM measurement in which the mass increase at around 0.2 V corresponds to this doping process. The second redox peak (B, B\u2032) corresponds to a deprotonation and protonation process. Besides the proton/cation exchange, the anion is also expelled from the polyaniline film during deprotanation . The small peak at around 0.5 V is probably due to a side reaction in the polyaniline film.\nIf one correlates the deposited mass with the transferred charge (Fig. 4(b)), first, the mass increased with the amount of charge transferred and then decreased again. The \u0394m/\u0394Q value in this region is 0.27 \u03bcg/mC. This value is smaller than the theoretical \u0394m/\u0394Q value of SO4 2\u2212 (0.50 \u03bcg/mC). This might be due to the participation of protons in the charge compensation. At around 1.8 mC/cm\u22122 (0.7 V), the mass started to decrease again. The \u0394m/\u0394Q value in this region is 0.18 mC/cm\u22122. This should be attributed to a combination of protonation, anion de-doping, and degradation . The degradation could result in a mass loss after potential cycling as seen in this figure. In our QCM experiments, a mass loss of 60% of the deposited polyaniline film was observed after 10 potential cycles between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V (cf. also Fig. 7).\nIn the transmission measurements, the decrease of the transmitted intensity begins at around 0.1 V for both wavelengths, \u03bb=632.8 and 1152 nm as shown in Fig. 5 . These wavelengths were intentionally chosen in order to compare with ESPR results discussed later. As can be seen from the Fresnel algorithm calculations, the transmitted intensity depends mostly on the imaginary part (\u03b5\u2033) of the dielectric constant of the deposited polyaniline film. The absorption around 632.8 nm is generally attributed to the exciton absorption of the quinoid ring structures . Therefore, the decrease at around 0.1 V shows the oxidation of the polyaniline film from its leucoemeraldine to its emeraldine state, which contains quinoid ring structures. The absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region is known to be due to free charge carriers in a highly conductive state . At the first oxidation peak, the polyaniline film changes to the \u201cemeraldine\u201d form from the \u201cleucoemeraldine\u201d form. This \u201cemeraldine\u201d form is protonated in the acid solution so that it has a high conductivity. At the second oxidation peak, the polyaniline film is changed to the \u201cpernigraniline\u201d state from the \u201cemeraldine\u201d form and is deprotonated so that it is not highly conductive.\nIn the previous section, a qualitative analysis of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant could be given for the three states of the polyaniline film. In order to be quantitative to all parameters of the films, i.e., its thickness, and the real and imaginary part of dielectric constant, we used ESPR and EQCM data taken under potentiostatic measurement conditions. In Fig. 6 , the potentiostatic SPR scans are shown for both \u03bb=632.8 and 1152 nm, respectively. All SPR angular scans were started after each potential was applied for 2 min in order to have the same conditions as in the QCM measurements. Some very interesting information was obtained from the analysis of these curves. First, it is noticeable that the change in the reflectivity curves at around 0.2 V occurs when the polyaniline \u201cbase\u201d film changes, upon doping, into the corresponding conducting polyaniline salt. This process is reversible and many cycles can be performed without any noticeable variation (except for any degradation processes). If the film, in the absence of monomers, is kept at 0.9 V, the SPR behavior is again likened to that of the insulating state and subsequent SPR scans at 0.65, 0.4, \u22120.2, 0.4, and 0.65 V showed no difference. This indicates that in the absence of the aniline monomer, oxidation at potentials higher than ca. 0.65 V leads to an irreversible degradation of the electrochemical response of the polyaniline film.\nSince it is difficult to obtain independent information on the thickness and the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant from mere SPR measurement, we also used the QCM in a potentiostatic mode of the measurement. As explained before, the Sauerbrey equation could be applied to relate frequency shifts to mass changes. Fig. 7 shows the potentiostatic QCM measurements for several potentials and the corresponding thickness, roughly estimated on the assumption of a mass density of 1.3 g/cm3 for comparison with the ESPR results. For changing the potential, a step potential program was used. In contrast to the SPR reflectivity curves, which show a large change at 0.2 V, the thickness from the QCM measurement was found to be roughly constant between \u22120.2 and 0.2 V. As can be seen from Fig. 7, a substantial degradation and loss of material sets in at 0.9 V so that one cannot obtain a meaningful film thickness at 0.9 V. The loss of film thickness at 0.9 V was found to be 38 % after 3 min. Fitting the experimental SPR reflectivity results with the thickness values obtained from QCM measurement (except the value of 0.9 V) gives the theoretical reflectivity curves that are also shown in Fig. 6. The calculation was done by using Fresnel\u2019s equations for a Prism/Cr/Au/PANI/electrolyte solution architecture. Details for the fitting procedure can be found elsewhere . Although the SP resonance at \u03bb=1152 nm is very broad at high potential, excellent fitting curves were obtained in most cases. The fitting parameters obtained are shown in Fig. 8 . Dramatic changes both in the real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric constants were determined at both wavelengths. The trends of changes in the imaginary part at both wavelengths coincide well with the transmittance measurements shown in Fig. 5. The error bars in Fig. 8 are based on the density fluctuation of the polymer upon doping/de-doping, that is 1.25\u20131.35. Based on these calculations, the accuracy for the determination of the complex dielectric constant is estimated to be better than \u00b10.02 for the real part and \u00b10.10 for the imaginary part of the dielectric constant in this density range, i.e., ESPR measurements are able to determine the complex dielectric constants of the conducting polymer films in the doped/de-doped state rather independently of the uncertainty in the film density. Thus, the electrochromic phenomena of PANI films can be characterized by this ESPR technique with high sensitivity, which may lead to new designs for SPR-based sensors/biosensors based on the electrochromism of thin conducting polymer films. Similar experiments are currently underway with other conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).\nUsing the combined electrochemical-surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (ESPR) and the electrochemical-quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, it was possible to monitor quantitatively the electropolymerization and doping/dedoping properties of polyaniline films on a flat gold substrate surface. Transmittance and potentiostatic SPR measurements were carried out with two wavelengths in order to obtain independent information about the electrochromic properties of the thin polayaniline film. The change in the electrochemical/optical properties of the thin film upon doping produces a dramatic change in the SPR response primarily due to a distinct change in the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. The contribution of the thickness is roughly estimated independently by EQCM measurements. Thus, using these experimental combinations, we have demonstrated the ability to obtain independent quantitative values on the thickness and the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant at two wavelengths. These techniques should be a powerful combination for the quantitative analysis of other conjugated polymer ultrathin films.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "The electrochemical and optical quantitative analysis of \u03c0-conjugated polymer ultrathin films upon oxidation/reduction and doping/dedoping is of great interest to a number of applications. This includes electrochromic displays , battery electrodes , sensors, and others. Because of the many factors affecting the transition between the doped and dedoped states of these polymer films, it is very difficult to obtain the quantitative analysis of each electrochemical event. A number of experimental in situ techniques on the doping/dedoping process of conjugated polymers has been introduced such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) , FTIR , scanning probe microscopy (SPM) , etc.\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy has become a widely accepted method for the characterization and study of ultrathin films, interfaces and kinetic processes at surfaces . The combination of SPR with electrochemical measurements has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for the simultaneous characterization and manipulation of electrode/electrolyte interfaces . With electrochemical-SPR measurements, the gold substrate that carries the optical surface mode is simultaneously used as the working electrode in the electrochemical experiments. One advantage of using the ESPR technique is that the electrochemical and optical properties are obtained simultaneously from films on the nanometer thickness scale. Recently, the ESPR technique has been applied also for the characterization of a variety of conducting polymer films . This involved the in situ monitoring of the film swelling/shrinking and the electrochromic properties during electropolymerization or anion doping/de-doping. The ESPR technique has also been combined with surface plasmon field enhanced light scattering (SPFELS) and the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique for the characterization of conducting polymer films. A first attempt to combine the QCM/SPR with electrochemical measurements was recently reported by Bailey et al. Attempts to combine SPR/SPFELS with the electropolymerization of conducting polymers have also been recently described by our group . We investigated the electrochemical process of polyaniline using the combined technique to obtain information on the morphological transition corresponding to the electrochemical and dielectric properties during in-situ electropolymerization.\nPolyaniline (PANI) has been known and studied extensively since the 1980s . The interest in this material and its derivatives is mainly due to its interesting electrical and optical properties together with its chemical tunability, ease of derivatization, solubility in a variety of solvents, processability into fibers and films, and its stability. During the past two decades, the chemical and physical properties of polyaniline have been studied extensively under different conditions and, together with polypyrrole, this material has become one of the most popular conducting polymers. A complete review of the tremendous advances in the chemistry, electrochemistry, physics, theory, and processing of polyaniline has been given by MacDiarmid . Polyaniline has three main stable oxidation states: the fully reduced \u201cleucoemeraldine\u201d form, the 50% oxidized \u201cemeraldine\u201d form, and the fully oxidized \u201cpernigraniline\u201d form. Each of these can exist in the form of its base or in the form of its protonated (doped) salt. Oxidative doping of the \u201cleucoemeraldine\u201d or protonic acid doping of the \u201cemeraldine\u201d produces the conducting form, with an increase in conductivity, which can reach up to 10 orders of magnitude; the conductivity of the emeraldine salt can vary between 0.5 and 400 S/cm depending on the preparation .\nIn this study, the quantitative analysis of an ultrathin polyaniline film during the oxidation/reduction and the doping/dedoping cycles is reported using ESPR and EQCM techniques. First, the electropolymerization process is investigated. The deposition process as monitored by the QCM allowed for the determination of the amount of charge transferred to each monomer during the electropolymerization. The SPR reflectivity curve during the electropolymerization strongly depends on the dielectric constant of the deposited polyaniline film. Upon oxidation and reduction and upon doping and dedoping, the polyaniline films undergo a substantial increase and decrease, respectively, in conductivity. These changes occur simultaneously with significant changes in the dielectric constants and the thickness of the films and hence, their optical behavior as probed by SPR and QCM. The film properties, i.e., thickness, real part, and imaginary part of the dielectric constant upon doping/dedoping could be determined quantitatively by these techniques.\nAniline and sulfuric acid were purchased and used as received from Aldrich and Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, respectively.\nAll potentiostatic and cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using a one-compartment, three-electrode cell driven by an EG & G PAR potentiostat (Model 263A). In all the measurements, the working electrodes consisted of gold films (d\u223c50 nm) vacuum evaporated unto an LaSFN9 glass substrate (with an adhesion layer of 2 nm Cr, previously evaporated on glass). The counter electrode was a platinum wire and the reference an Ag|AgCl 3 M NaCl aqueous electrode. All the potentials reported in this paper are relative to this reference electrode. The solutions were carefully purged with nitrogen.\nThe SPR set-up combines the three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Kretschmann configuration for the excitation of surface plasmons. Details of this set-up can be found elsewhere . Surface plasmons are excited by reflecting p-polarized laser light off the Au-coated base of the prism. The excitation sources employed were two different He\u2013Ne lasers: \u03bb=632.8 and 1152 nm. Kinetic measurements were performed in order to monitor the formation of the polyaniline film and the oxidation/reduction and doping/dedoping properties of the deposited polyaniline thin film via reflectivity changes as a function of time. Angular measurements were also performed by scanning an incident angle range while the potential was held constant. For these experiments, the gold film thickness was chosen for optimum excitation of the surface plasmons with both wavelengths (42\u201345 nm). The electrode surface area was 0.785 cm2.\nCommercial 5 MHz AT-cut quartz crystals with Au electrodes and a crystal holder (Maxtek Inc., USA) were used. The front electrode of the crystal was used as the working area and the back electrode was grounded, and both electrodes were connected at the back side to an impedance analyzer. On both sides of the crystal, O-rings were used to prevent leakage. Details concerning this set-up can be found elsewhere . The crystals were plasma cleaned before measurement. An impedance analyzer (HP E5100A, 10 kHz\u2013300 MHz, Agilent Technologies) was used in the measurement. From the impedance analysis, both the shift in frequency and the change in the half-band-half width (HBHW) are obtained from fits of the resonance curves to the conductance spectra. The latter quantity is related to dissipation. In order to separate the rf voltage (network analyzer) and the dc voltage (potentiostat), a combination of a capacitor and an inductance was used as described elsewhere . In EQCM, the electrode surface area was determined to be 1.33 cm2.\nIn order to complement the information obtained by the ESPR and the EQCM experiments, transmittance measurements were carried out with both lasers during the potential cycling (cyclic voltammetry), between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. In this case, the gold film thickness was reduced to 20 nm to allow transmission measurements on the glass substrates.\nElectrochemical polymerization of aniline on the gold surface was achieved by applying potential cycling between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) obtained during the electropolymerization is shown in Fig. 1a up to the seventh cycle. Similar conditions in aqueous H2SO4 for the potential range described, has been used by many groups . As reported previously, the first redox process (ca. 0.22 V in the positive scan and 0.05 V in the negative scan) corresponds to the electron transfer from/to the electrodeposited polyaniline film. In order to compensate the charge of the polyaniline film, anion transport from/to the electrolyte solution, i.e., anion doping and dedoping , should occur. This phenomenon is responsible for the dramatic change in the conductivity of the PANI film. The electrodeposition of polyaniline on the Au electrode proceeds via a radical cation mechanism. The second redox process (ca. 0.5 and 0.45 V, for the oxidation and reduction, respectively) probably corresponds to side reactions such as decomposition of the polymer. The large currents observed at the positive end of the CV are due to the superposition of two distinct processes: one is the electron transfer from the PANI film corresponding to the oxidation of the PANI film and the other is the electron transfer from the aniline monomer to the electrode corresponding to the oxidation of the aniline monomer to produce a precursor for the PANI film. A series of angular SPR curves taken after each potential cycle are shown in Fig. 1b. These scans were measured in the solution at open circuit potential (ocp \u2248 0.15 V). Shifts of the dip angles in the SPR curves were observed indicating that polyaniline was deposited onto the gold film electrode during each potential cycle.\nThe in situ formation of the PANI film on the gold electrode surface was monitored by the measurement of the charge transferred, by QCM and by SPR. Fig. 2 shows the complex frequency change during electropolymerization by cycling the potential between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. Each arrow shows the starting point of each potential cycle, i.e., \u22120.2 V. In the QCM measurements, the Sauerbrey-approximation was used for the analysis of the frequency shifts, stating that the frequency shift is mostly caused by deposition of mass on the crystal surface. Thus one obtains: \u0394f/f\u2248\u2212\u0394m/mq=\u2212\u0394m2f0/Zq, with \u0394f the frequency shift, f the frequency, f 0 the fundamental frequency, \u0394m the change in areal mass density for the film, m q=Z q/(2f 0) the areal mass density of the quartz plate, and Z q=8.8 \u00d7 106 kg m\u22122 s\u22121 the acoustic impedance of the AT-cut quartz crystal. The Sauerbrey approximation does not account for viscous losses or viscoelastic effects. In air, such viscoelastic effects scale as the cube of the film thickness and can be neglected. In liquids this is not the case. Because the liquid exerts a lateral stress onto the moving upper surface of the film, there are viscoelastic effects which scale linearly with the mass. This leads to a modified Sauerbrey equation, which is \u0394f+i\u0394\u0393f\u2248\u2212\u0394mmq1\u2212Zq2Zf2\u221212\u03c0if\u03c1l\u03b7lZq2 \u2248\u2212\u0394mmq1\u22122\u03c0if\u03c1l\u03b7lZf2 =\u2212\u0394mmq1\u2212Jf2\u03c0if\u03c1l\u03b7l\u03c1f, where \u03c1 l is the density of the liquid, \u03b7 l is the viscosity of the liquid, Z f is the acoustic impedance of the film, \u03c1 f is the density of the film, and J f=J f \u2032\u2212iJ f\u2033 is the complex compliance of the film. In the second line the relation Z q\u226bZ f (film is softer than quartz plate) has been used. Note that the above expression is only the first term of a Taylor expansion in the film mass \u0394m. More complicated equations apply for films with a thickness comparable to the wavelength of sound . For the analysis of conventional QCM data, the above equation is of limited use because it does not allow for a separation of mass effects and viscoelastic effects (the second term in the curly brackets). One defines a \u201cSauerbrey mass\u201d which is the true mass times the unknown correction factor in curly brackets. If, on the other hand, the bandwidth (HBHW) is available, it can be interpreted in the frame of this equation. The ratio of \u0394\u0393 and \u2212\u0394f should be independent of mass. This is indeed the case for our data, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The quantity \u2212\u0394\u0393/\u0394f corresponds to the ratio of the imaginary and the real part of the curly bracket, namely \u2212\u0394\u0393\u0394f\u2248J\u2032f\u03c1f/2\u03c0f\u03c1l\u03b7l\u2212J\u2033f. The above equation allows for some further conclusions. Assuming \u03c1 f\u2248\u03c1 l the first term in the denominator is of the order of the viscous compliance of the liquid. Further assuming that the liquid is much softer than the film, J f\u2033\u226a1/(2\u03c0f\u03b7) (a safe assumption for most polymeric films) one reaches the conclusion \u0394\u0393\u0394f\u2248J\u2032f2\u03c0f\u03b7l\u2248J\u2032f/[30MPa\u22121], where \u03b7 l\u224810\u22123 Pa s and f=5 \u00d7 106 has been used in the second line. The quantity \u2212\u0394\u0393/\u0394f therefore provides a measure of the elastic compliance of the films. Note that this interpretation contradicts simple intuition to some degree: while one would naively associate a shift in bandwidth to a dissipation inside a film (given by J\u2033, the detailed derivation shows that it is actually the elastic compliance, J \u2032, which is measured.\nAgain, in liquids a modified Sauerbrey equation holds, which is different from the dry case in two respects: first, the mass, \u0394m includes the trapped liquid. Second, there are viscoelastic corrections as given by the curly bracket in Eq. (1). As for the frequency shift, nothing can be learned because the elastic correction is inseparable from the effect of the (unknown) mass. One can, however, extract information from the bandwidth. Making some assumptions, the bandwidth can be used to estimate the elastic compliance, J \u2032, of the film.\nThe application of this formalism to our data is illustrated in this Figure. Fig. 2(a) shows the raw data. \u2212\u0394f and \u0394\u0393 mostly go in parallel, but not quite. During every positive scan, the ratio \u2212\u0394\u0393/\u0394f drops slightly (Fig. 2(b)). During every negative scan, it increases again. This behavior is largely independent of thickness (Fig. 2(c), the \u201cD\u2013f-plot\u201d, where \u201cD\u201d stands for \u201cdissipation\u201d). The above quantitative discussion suggests that the (average) elastic compliance of the film is in the range of 10 MPa. It drops slightly during a positive scan and recovers during a negative scan. One possibility for this is that the PANI film becomes more porous by de-doping but recovers by doping. Shown in Fig. 3(a) are the mass change as a function of time during the seven electropolymerization cycles and corresponding SPR minimum angle shifts measured after each potential cycle. Each arrow shows the starting point of each potential cycle, i.e. \u22120.2 V. In observing the mass change, the increase in each of the cycles mostly corresponds to the oxidation of aniline to form the polyaniline film and the doping of anions into the deposited polyaniline film. The decrease of the curve is mostly due to the dedoping of the anions from the deposited polyaniline film. The trace of the SPR minimum angle shift was similar to the mass change at \u22120.2 V, i.e., at the end of each potential cycle. This indicates that the optical thickness corresponds to the acoustic mass. The kinetic measurements for SPR were performed at a fixed angle, 58.0\u00b0 slightly below the angle of the reflectivity minimum (see Fig. 1(b)) of the blank gold substrate as shown in Fig. 3(b). In the kinetic measurement, the behavior of the reflectivity shows a large difference with mass change. In the case of the SPR reflectivity, the curve is very sensitive to the thickness, the real (\u03b5 \u2032) and the imaginary (\u03b5\u2033) parts of the dielectric constant. The increase in reflectivity below about +0.2 V was seen in the figure whereas no increase was observed in the mass. This clearly indicates that the dielectric constant changes dramatically in this potential range (\u22120.2 to +0.2 V). Fig. 3(c) shows the current efficiency, \u0394m/\u0394Q during the electropolymerization process. From this plot, it was found that the current efficiency increases with time. This property is also seen in the change of the mass as a function of charge transferred as shown in the inset. In EQCM measurements, the areal mass density m f during electropolymerization is related to the charge density passed Q, on the other hand, it also contributes to the generation of solute oligomer . In the case of electropolymerization for the conducting polymer, the theoretical value of the current efficiency, m f/Q is calculated from, mfQ=(MM\u22122MH)+xAMA(2+xA)F, where M M, M A, and M H are the molar masses of the monomer, the incorporated anion, and hydrogen. The quantity x A is the doping level equal to the ratio of the number of moles of inserted anion to that of monomer group in the film. F is the Faraday constant, 96 485 C mol\u22121. The incorporation of water molecules and neutral salts which can cause apparently higher \u0394m/\u0394Q values, were not included in this model. Assuming x A=0.4, the theoretical current efficiency \u0394m/\u0394Q is expected to be 0.952 \u03bcg/mC. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the value found experimentally, was at first, much smaller than the theoretical value, and then finally was much larger (the ratio of experimentally determined \u0394m/\u0394Q exp/theoretical current efficiency \u0394m/\u0394Q theo: 48.6 % after seven cycles) than for the initial potential cycles of electropolymerization (17.3% after 1 cycle). This indicates that a number of side reactions, which do not correspond to a mass increase, e.g., the formation of oligomers, accompany the ultrathin film formation .\nThe cyclic voltammetry curve of a deposited PANI film in monomer-free solution is shown in Fig. 4(a) . The cyclic voltammetry was scanned between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in a monomer-free 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. As mentioned before, the first redox peak (A, A\u2032) is commonly assumed to correspond to the electron transfer from/to the PANI film. In order to compensate the charge of the PANI film, anion doping/dedoping of the polyaniline film occurs. This is also seen in the EQCM measurement in which the mass increase at around 0.2 V corresponds to this doping process. The second redox peak (B, B\u2032) corresponds to a deprotonation and protonation process. Besides the proton/cation exchange, the anion is also expelled from the polyaniline film during deprotanation . The small peak at around 0.5 V is probably due to a side reaction in the polyaniline film.\nIf one correlates the deposited mass with the transferred charge (Fig. 4(b)), first, the mass increased with the amount of charge transferred and then decreased again. The \u0394m/\u0394Q value in this region is 0.27 \u03bcg/mC. This value is smaller than the theoretical \u0394m/\u0394Q value of SO4 2\u2212 (0.50 \u03bcg/mC). This might be due to the participation of protons in the charge compensation. At around 1.8 mC/cm\u22122 (0.7 V), the mass started to decrease again. The \u0394m/\u0394Q value in this region is 0.18 mC/cm\u22122. This should be attributed to a combination of protonation, anion de-doping, and degradation . The degradation could result in a mass loss after potential cycling as seen in this figure. In our QCM experiments, a mass loss of 60% of the deposited polyaniline film was observed after 10 potential cycles between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V (cf. also Fig. 7).\nIn the transmission measurements, the decrease of the transmitted intensity begins at around 0.1 V for both wavelengths, \u03bb=632.8 and 1152 nm as shown in Fig. 5 . These wavelengths were intentionally chosen in order to compare with ESPR results discussed later. As can be seen from the Fresnel algorithm calculations, the transmitted intensity depends mostly on the imaginary part (\u03b5\u2033) of the dielectric constant of the deposited polyaniline film. The absorption around 632.8 nm is generally attributed to the exciton absorption of the quinoid ring structures . Therefore, the decrease at around 0.1 V shows the oxidation of the polyaniline film from its leucoemeraldine to its emeraldine state, which contains quinoid ring structures. The absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region is known to be due to free charge carriers in a highly conductive state . At the first oxidation peak, the polyaniline film changes to the \u201cemeraldine\u201d form from the \u201cleucoemeraldine\u201d form. This \u201cemeraldine\u201d form is protonated in the acid solution so that it has a high conductivity. At the second oxidation peak, the polyaniline film is changed to the \u201cpernigraniline\u201d state from the \u201cemeraldine\u201d form and is deprotonated so that it is not highly conductive.\nIn the previous section, a qualitative analysis of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant could be given for the three states of the polyaniline film. In order to be quantitative to all parameters of the films, i.e., its thickness, and the real and imaginary part of dielectric constant, we used ESPR and EQCM data taken under potentiostatic measurement conditions. In Fig. 6 , the potentiostatic SPR scans are shown for both \u03bb=632.8 and 1152 nm, respectively. All SPR angular scans were started after each potential was applied for 2 min in order to have the same conditions as in the QCM measurements. Some very interesting information was obtained from the analysis of these curves. First, it is noticeable that the change in the reflectivity curves at around 0.2 V occurs when the polyaniline \u201cbase\u201d film changes, upon doping, into the corresponding conducting polyaniline salt. This process is reversible and many cycles can be performed without any noticeable variation (except for any degradation processes). If the film, in the absence of monomers, is kept at 0.9 V, the SPR behavior is again likened to that of the insulating state and subsequent SPR scans at 0.65, 0.4, \u22120.2, 0.4, and 0.65 V showed no difference. This indicates that in the absence of the aniline monomer, oxidation at potentials higher than ca. 0.65 V leads to an irreversible degradation of the electrochemical response of the polyaniline film.\nSince it is difficult to obtain independent information on the thickness and the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant from mere SPR measurement, we also used the QCM in a potentiostatic mode of the measurement. As explained before, the Sauerbrey equation could be applied to relate frequency shifts to mass changes. Fig. 7 shows the potentiostatic QCM measurements for several potentials and the corresponding thickness, roughly estimated on the assumption of a mass density of 1.3 g/cm3 for comparison with the ESPR results. For changing the potential, a step potential program was used. In contrast to the SPR reflectivity curves, which show a large change at 0.2 V, the thickness from the QCM measurement was found to be roughly constant between \u22120.2 and 0.2 V. As can be seen from Fig. 7, a substantial degradation and loss of material sets in at 0.9 V so that one cannot obtain a meaningful film thickness at 0.9 V. The loss of film thickness at 0.9 V was found to be 38 % after 3 min. Fitting the experimental SPR reflectivity results with the thickness values obtained from QCM measurement (except the value of 0.9 V) gives the theoretical reflectivity curves that are also shown in Fig. 6. The calculation was done by using Fresnel\u2019s equations for a Prism/Cr/Au/PANI/electrolyte solution architecture. Details for the fitting procedure can be found elsewhere . Although the SP resonance at \u03bb=1152 nm is very broad at high potential, excellent fitting curves were obtained in most cases. The fitting parameters obtained are shown in Fig. 8 . Dramatic changes both in the real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric constants were determined at both wavelengths. The trends of changes in the imaginary part at both wavelengths coincide well with the transmittance measurements shown in Fig. 5. The error bars in Fig. 8 are based on the density fluctuation of the polymer upon doping/de-doping, that is 1.25\u20131.35. Based on these calculations, the accuracy for the determination of the complex dielectric constant is estimated to be better than \u00b10.02 for the real part and \u00b10.10 for the imaginary part of the dielectric constant in this density range, i.e., ESPR measurements are able to determine the complex dielectric constants of the conducting polymer films in the doped/de-doped state rather independently of the uncertainty in the film density. Thus, the electrochromic phenomena of PANI films can be characterized by this ESPR technique with high sensitivity, which may lead to new designs for SPR-based sensors/biosensors based on the electrochromism of thin conducting polymer films. Similar experiments are currently underway with other conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).\nUsing the combined electrochemical-surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (ESPR) and the electrochemical-quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, it was possible to monitor quantitatively the electropolymerization and doping/dedoping properties of polyaniline films on a flat gold substrate surface. Transmittance and potentiostatic SPR measurements were carried out with two wavelengths in order to obtain independent information about the electrochromic properties of the thin polayaniline film. The change in the electrochemical/optical properties of the thin film upon doping produces a dramatic change in the SPR response primarily due to a distinct change in the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. The contribution of the thickness is roughly estimated independently by EQCM measurements. Thus, using these experimental combinations, we have demonstrated the ability to obtain independent quantitative values on the thickness and the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant at two wavelengths. These techniques should be a powerful combination for the quantitative analysis of other conjugated polymer ultrathin films."

Biofilms represent a ubiquitous form of microbial life in the natural environment. They can occur at solid\u2013liquid, solid\u2013air, liquid\u2013liquid, and liquid\u2013air interfaces [1\u20134]. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms which are embedded in a matrix formed by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Water is the major component in the biofilm matrix and can make up to 98% of the biofilm mass. Depending on the biofilm type and microorganisms involved, up to 90% of the particulate fraction of the biofilm can be EPS [5]. EPS are biopolymers of microbial origin such as polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and phospholipids. EPS play a major role in the formation and maintenance of the biofilm structure [6]. The EPS matrix mediates the cell/cell contacts (quorum sensing), protects biofilm against environmental stress, caused e.g. by antibiotics, and prevents biofilm desiccation. The actual structure of the biofilm matrix varies greatly, depending on the microbial cells present, their physiological status, the nutrients available, the prevailing environmental conditions, and the biofilm age [7, 8]. Detailed information about structure and chemical composition of the EPS matrix is needed for an optimization of biocides, antifouling strategies, and biological wastewater treatment.For in situ assessment of the biofilm structure, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has been proven to be a powerful technique that reveals a three-dimensional structural image with microscopic resolution [5, 9]. However, chemical information usually can be extracted only by special staining which is unfavorable for in situ applications and of limited specificity. As EPS are a complex mixture of different polymers with a large number of potential binding sites, the staining of the total EPS is complicated. The combination of CLSM with another technique, which allows these limitations to be overcome and provides additional chemical information about biofilm components and their distribution, is desired to improve the understanding of the composition and structure of the biofilm matrix.Raman microscopy (RM) is a nondestructive analytical technique that provides fingerprint spectra with spatial resolution of an optical microscope. It requires no or limited sample preparation. Raman spectra are characterized by a high specificity, revealing usually sharper and clearer bands than IR spectra, and low water background. As compared to IR microscopy, excitation with visible light can be employed in Raman spectroscopy, which allows the use of standard optics. The common integration of Raman spectroscopy with a microscope enables spectral analysis with micrometer spatial resolution. Moreover, no tuneable excitation source is needed, since the whole spectrum can be collected by excitation with a fixed laser wavelength.RM was applied to generate \u201cwhole-organism fingerprints\u201d for the characterization and identification of different biological systems (bacteria, yeast, pollen), since all biologically associated molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids exhibit distinct spectral features [10\u201316]. RM was used to describe the spatial distribution of the biofilm biomass by Marcotte et al. [17] and to characterize the microbial composition of a biofilm [18]. P\u00e4tzold et al. focused on the distribution of different microorganisms and other substances (minerals) inside intact multispecies biofilm. Recently, Sandt et al. [19] applied RM for studying the chemical heterogeneities of monospecies biofilm (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) cultivated in flow cell. They used the spectroscopic signature of cells (as one component) and EPS (as another component) to characterize the composition and development of biofilm. A spectrum of EPS with still unidentified bands (no chemical information about EPS composition) was obtained by subtraction of the spectrum of the EDTA-treated cells from that of the untreated cells. The feasibility of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for label-free characterization of nanostructures in biofilms was also recently tested on a model system, calcium alginate, by Schmid et al. [20].In this paper we explore the potential of RM for the nondestructive chemical characterization of multispecies biofilm matrix including microbial constituents and EPS. We analyze a wide range of reference samples (polysaccharide, proteins) that might be present in EPS matrix, microorganisms as well as encapsulated bacteria and multispecies biofilms. Thus, we demonstrate that RM can provide detailed information about chemical composition of complete biofilm matrix.Materials and methodsReference samplesThe following selection of microorganism-specific polysaccharides were analyzed by RM: cellulose (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany and ICN Biomedicals Inc., USA), dextran (6, 40,100, and 500\u00a0kDa, Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), xanthan (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), gellan (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), alginic acid (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), sodium alginate (Carl Roth, Germany), and calcium and iron(III) alginate. The last two samples were produced from sodium alginate and calcium, respectively, iron(III) chloride by the following procedure: 5\u00a0mL of a 2% solution of sodium alginate was added to a stirred solution of 10\u00a0mL of 0.2\u00a0M Ca or Fe(III) chloride and kept overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The gelled alginates were then washed with distilled water to remove unbound salt and dried at room temperature. As reference materials for proteins, albumin bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), albumin chicken egg (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and casein bovine milk (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) were chosen. In order to characterize the microorganisms in biofilms, Raman spectra of Escherichia coli (DSM 1116) and Raoultella planticola (DSM 3069), provided by the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Germany), were measured. The bacteria were cultivated in LB medium (tryptone 10\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121, yeast extract 5\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121, and NaCl 10\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121) in a shaking incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. An aliquot of 1\u00a0mL was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min. The bacterial pellet was twice resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again to remove residues of cultivation medium. Since low temperatures in general induce capsule synthesis [21], the bacterial pellets were stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h to stimulate the encapsulation of microorganisms by production of EPS.Multispecies biofilms were grown in a homemade funnel reactor as described elsewhere [22]. Briefly, the reactor consists of funnel with a working length of 1.2\u00a0m and a width of 0.072\u00a0m, manufactured from PVC. A magnetic gear pump was installed to achieve laminar (Re\u2009=\u20091,000) flow conditions. The volume of the mixing tank was exchanged five times per day. The pH value of the bulk phase was monitored continuously and set to a value between 6.5 and 7. The temperature of the cultivation medium, which was exchanged daily, was kept constant between 18 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C by a thermostat. The whole cultivation system was controlled by an automation system (Logo! 12/24RC logic module, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany). The inoculation was done with 500\u00a0mL of activated sludge supernatant from the municipal waste water treatment plant of Garching (Germany). Biofilm 1 was cultivated on glass slides with 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose for 2\u00a0months. For biofilms 2 and 3, marked glass slides (epoxy resin marking, Paul Marienfeld GmbH & Co. KG, Lauda-K\u00f6nigsfeld, Germany) were used as substratum. Samples 2 and 3 were grown for 1 or 3\u00a0months, respectively, with 3\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose, 8\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 (NH4)2SO4, 2.8\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 CaCl2, 7\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 NaNO3, 5\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 FeSO4\u00b77H2O, and 0.2\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 K2HPO4.Raman microscopyA Renishaw 2000 Raman microscope system (Renishaw, UK) was used. All measurements were carried out using a He\u2013Ne laser (\u03bb0\u2009=\u2009633\u00a0nm, 25\u00a0mW, resulting in ca. 7\u00a0mW laser power on the sample). Wavelength calibrations were performed by measuring silicon wafers through a \u00d750 objective, featuring a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.75, and evaluating the first-order phonon band of Si at 520\u00a0cm\u22121. All reference samples were analyzed on CaF2 disks by means of a \u00d750 objective. The biofilms were examined directly on glass slides with a \u00d763 water immersion objective (NA\u2009=\u20090.9, laser spot diameter ca. 1\u00a0\u00b5m), and 100\u00a0s exposure time. The cultivation media caused no noticeable signals in Raman spectra. Nevertheless, the samples were placed in homemade transparent PMMA boxes filled with tap water before analysis, according to our standard protocol for Raman measurements of biofilm grown with different nutrients. No significant bands from the glass substratum were observed. The biofilm spectra were characterized by a relatively low or moderate fluorescence background, compared with spectra obtained with \u03bb0\u2009=\u2009514\u00a0nm (data not shown).The theoretical lateral resolution of the measurements, calculated according to the Abbe formula (0.63\u03bb0/NA), was 0.44\u00a0\u00b5m. Axial resolutions of 3.5\u00a0\u00b5m and 8.5\u00a0\u00b5m were determined for confocal and semiconfocal modes, respectively. This was done by plotting the intensity of the 520\u00a0cm\u22121 band of Si as a function of distance (20\u00a0\u00b5m with 1\u00a0\u00b5m step) from the tightest focus. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the obtained curve gives us the axial resolution. The spectra of multispecies biofilms collected in confocal mode were characterized by the same spectroscopic signature as spectra obtained in semiconfocal mode and by somewhat lower signal-to-noise ratio. The biofilm spectra presented here were collected in semiconfocal mode.Spectra were processed via the WiRE 1.2 software (Renishaw, UK) running under GRAMS/32 (Thermo Galactic, USA) which also controls the Raman microscope system and data acquisition.Confocal laser scanning microscopy and digital image analysisAll CLSM data reported here were created with a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). The system is controlled by the AIM software (version 3.2, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). The microscope is equipped with different laser sources with excitation wavelengths of 351, 361, 477, 488, 514, 543, and 633\u00a0nm. A \u00d740 water immersion objective (NA\u2009=\u20090.8) was applied to examine the biofilm matrix directly on the slide. The pinhole sizes for each scan channel of the LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscopy were adjusted to scan all channels with an identical optical slice thickness [23] of 0.78\u00a0\u00b5m. Image analysis was performed with the freely available software ImageJ, version 1.39i [24], including the LSM-Reader plugin to open LSM5 formatted image stacks.The distribution of EPS glycoconjugates, nucleic acids (indicating location of microorganisms), and proteins was analyzed. EPS glycoconjugates were stained with the Aleuria aurantia lectin (LINARIS Biologische Produkte GmbH, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany), labeled with AlexaFluor\u00ae 488 (AAL 488, invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA), and nucleic acids were stained with SYTO 60\u00ae (invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) according to the protocol described by Neu et al. [25]. A combination of AAL 488 and SYTO 60\u00ae was applied following Neu et al. and Staudt et al. [25, 26]. A combination of SYTO 60\u00ae and SYPRO Orange\u00ae (invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) was used to stain nucleic acids and proteins [27].Results and discussionRaman microscopic analysis of reference samplesPolysaccharides are one major component of EPS matrix. Some polysaccharides are neutral macromolecules (cellulose, dextran) but the majority are polyanionic due to the presence of either uronic acids (alginate, xanthan), acetyl groups (xanthan, gellan), or ketal-linked pyruvate (xanthan) [28, 29].Figure\u00a01 illustrates the fingerprint Raman spectra of biofilm-specific polysaccharides. These spectra show bands in three major regions: CH/CH2 deformations at 1,500\u20131,200\u00a0cm\u22121; C\u2013C stretch, C\u2013O\u2013C glucosidic link, and ring breathing modes at 1,200\u2013950\u00a0cm\u22121; and side group deformations at 950\u2013700\u00a0cm\u22121 [30\u201332]. Additionally, C=O and COO\u2212 stretch vibrations [33] were found for alginic acid, Na alginate, xanthan, and gellan. Table\u00a01 summarizes the assignment of the Raman bands of reference samples, the biofilm matrix, and corresponding references. The comparison of the spectra from polysaccharides with various structures reveals significant differences in Raman band shapes and intensities. In particular, the regions of glucosidic ring vibrations at 1,200\u20131,000\u00a0cm\u22121 and side group deformations (and the carboxyl group stretch region in the case of polyanionic polysaccharides) contain most of the structural information and can be used for characterization of polysaccharides and identification of individual components in the EPS matrix.\nFig.\u00a01Raman spectra of biofilm-specific polysaccharidesTable\u00a01Assignment of the Raman bands of biofilm matrixPeak position (cm\u22121)AssignmentCarbohydratesProteinsDNA/RNACarotenoidsLipids1,750\u20131,735C=O str [33]C=O ester [41, 42, 46, 47]1,725C=O str [33]1,680\u20131,640Amide I [14, 40\u201343]1,660\u20131,650C=C, C=O [30]C=C, C=O [46, 47]1,650\u20131,540COO\u2212 asym [33]1,617\u20131,614C=C Tyr [40, 41, 43]; Trp [42]1,607C=C Phe [41, 43]; Tyr [42]1,600Arom ring str, lignin-like [30]1,581Trp [40]1,580\u20131,575G, A ring str [14, 41\u201343]1,550Trp [40]1,550\u20131,500C=C str [13, 49, 50]1,460\u20131,440\u03b4(CH2) scis [14, 43]; CH2 def [41, 43]\u03b4(CH2) scis [43]; CH2 def [41, 43]\u03b4(CH2) scis [43]; CH2 def [41, 43, 46]1,450\u20131,360COO\u2212 sym [33]1,345\u20131,314\u03b4(CH) [14, 42, 43]\u03b4(CH) [14, 42, 43]1,304\u20131,272CH2 twist [46, 47]1,261\u20131,266=C\u2013H in-plane def [46]1,280\u20131,200Amide III [14, 41\u201343]1,170\u20131,150C\u2013C str [13, 49, 50]1,160\u20131,150C\u2013C, C\u2013O ring breath, asym [31, 32, 46]1,127\u20131,125C\u2013C str, C\u2013O\u2013C glycosidic link; ring breath, sym [14, 30\u201332, 41, 46]C\u2013N, C\u2013C str [14, 41]C\u2013C str [41]1,095\u20131,090C\u2013C str, C\u2013O\u2013C glycosidic link; ring breath, sym [14, 30\u201332, 41, 43, 46]PO2\u2212 str, symm [42, 43]PO2\u2212 str, symm [42, 43]1,080C\u2013O\u2013H bend, C\u2013H bend [31]1,060C\u2013O, C\u2013C str [31, 41]C\u2013C; C\u2013N [41]1,020\u20131,000C\u2013CH3 def [13, 49, 50]1,000Ring breath Phe [14, 41, 43]899\u2013855C\u2013C str, C\u2013O\u2013C 1,4-glycosidic link [14, 41, 43]852Ring breath Tyr [41, 42]828Ring breath Tyr [41, 42]O\u2013P\u2013O str [42]785\u2013780C, U [14, 41, 43]760Ring breath Trp [42]730\u2013720CH2 [14]A [41]728Ring breath Trp [42]A [42]540\u2013530C\u2013O\u2013C glycosidic ring def [10, 41]480\u2013306Carbohydrates [10, 31]Abbreviations: bend bending, breath breathing, def deformation, scis scissoring, str stretching, asym asymetric, sym symetricTo characterize the influence of the biopolymer chain length on Raman spectra of polysaccharides, we examined dextran in a wide range of molecular mass (6, 40, 100, and 500\u00a0kDa). The differences in the Raman band positions and shapes were not significant (data not shown); only the relative intensity of dextran marker band at 540\u00a0cm\u22121 [34] to the band at 1,126\u00a0cm\u22121 slightly increased with increasing molecular mass from 6 to 100\u00a0kDa (1.205\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025, 1.263\u2009\u00b1\u20090.067, and 1.283\u2009\u00b1\u20090.053 for 6, 40, and 100\u00a0kDa, respectively). For higher masses it remained constant (1.268\u2009\u00b1\u20090.048 for 500\u00a0kDa). Hence, we can assume that the molecular mass (i.e., the length of the biopolymer chains) has no significant influence on the Raman spectra of polysaccharides.Multivalent cations such as Ca2+ are known to induce cross-linking of different polymer molecules as well as of different parts of the same polymer chain via binding of guluronic acid residues [35]. In alginates that are copolymers of \u03b2-D-mannuronic acid (M) and \u03b1-L-guluronic acid (G), the G\u2013G chain has a cavity-like site formed between adjacent G units into which Ca2+ ions can fit to form stable blocks that resemble the shape of an egg box. This leads to the formation of a stable supermolecular network with ordered helix structures.In order to analyze the influence of metal cations on Raman spectra of polysaccharides, we compared alginic acid with Na+, Ca2+, and Fe3+ alginic acid salts. Binding of cations induced several changes in the Raman spectra of alginates (Fig.\u00a02). For alginic acid, the band of the C=O stretch at 1,730\u00a0cm\u22121 is very strong. In a salt made of an alginic acid, asymmetric and symmetric stretch bands of the carboxyl ion (COO\u2212) appear at 1,615\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,410\u00a0cm\u22121. As compared to Na+ alginate, the symmetrical COO\u2212 peak of Ca2+ alginate exhibits a shift towards higher wavenumbers (6\u00a0cm\u22121) as well as a reduced relative intensity. An even higher shift (10\u201320\u00a0cm\u22121) was reported by Choupra et al. [35] and Schmid et al. [20] that can be explained by the use of alginates from different manufacturers and hence different G/M unit ratios. Nevertheless, these changes are in agreement with IR spectroscopy studies and can be associated to bidentate bridging of two ligands and/or chelation of one ligand [36\u201338]. For Fe3+ alginate, both C=O stretch (typical for alginic acid) and carboxyl ion stretch (typical for alginic acid salts) were observed. Moreover, significant changes in the peak positions and shapes were found in the region of the side group deformations below 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121.\nFig.\u00a02Raman spectra of alginatesIt should be mentioned that in our study we used alginates of algal origin. Commercially available alginates are usually obtained from brown algae. In comparison to algal alginates, the alginates produced by bacteria have a higher degree of polymerization. Moreover, bacterial alginates are characterized by the lack of homoguluronic units that is explained by the partial acetylation on the O-2 and O-3 positions of the M units. Acetyl groups prevent the conversion of M residues to G residues by C-5 epimerase and give bacteria a way to control the alginate composition and properties [39]. Nevertheless, algal alginates are shown to be an appropriate model to test the feasibility of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for label-free chemical characterization of nanostructures in biofilms [20]. We also applied algal alginate as a model polysaccharide to find out the frequency regions in the Raman spectra that can be used for the characterization of different polysaccharides and for the analysis of the influence of metal cations. However, the future identification of alginates in biofilm matrix will require the RM analysis of the alginates produced by bacteria.In the fingerprint region, the proteins exhibit the typical broad bands [40\u201343] from amide I near 1,650\u00a0cm\u22121 (C=O stretch, 70\u201380%; C\u2013N stretch, 10\u201330%; and N\u2013H deformation), amide III near 1,300\u00a0cm\u22121 (C\u2013N stretch, 40%; N\u2013H deformation, 30%; and C\u2013H deformation), ring vibrations from aromatic residues of tyrosine (Tyr), and phenylalanine (Phe) in the region between 1,615 and 1,605\u00a0cm\u22121 as well as a Phe band at ca. 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121 (data not shown). The band at ca. 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121 is typical for protein fingerprints, and can be used as a marker for the presence of proteins in the sample analyzed.For the characterization of the microorganisms in a biofilm by RM, we analyzed the Raman spectra of Escherichia coli and Raoultella planticola. These microorganisms, cultivated overnight, exhibit very similar spectra (1 and 2 in Fig.\u00a03) with characteristic bands of proteins (amide I, amide III, and ring vibrations from aromatic residues including the marker band of Phe at 1,002\u00a0cm\u22121), nucleic acids as well as weak bands of polysaccharides in the glucosidic ring region between 1,200 and 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121.\nFig.\u00a03Raman spectra of free E. coli (1), R. planticola (2) compared with encapsulated E. coli (3) and R. planticola (4), and polysaccharide dextranAs a reaction to environmental stress, bacteria like E. coli and especially R. planticola can produce EPS. These compounds may remain either unattached (as slime) or covalently linked (often by a phosphodiester or lipid link) to macromolecules on the cell surface [44]. In the latter case, the material may form a capsule which can be recognized microscopically and which may be attached firmly to the surface. This can make the separation of the EPS from bacteria very difficult [29]. Figure\u00a03 (spectra 3 and 4) shows significant differences in spectra of encapsulated E. coli and especially R. planticola compared with spectra of free bacteria (spectra 1 and 2). The Raman bands of R. planticola (spectrum 4) in the regions between 1,200 and 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121 and below 600\u00a0cm\u22121 are significantly stronger than those of the other strain (spectrum 3). As discussed above, these frequency ranges are characteristic for polysaccharides and associated predominantly with glucosidic ring vibrations. They indicate a substantial production of EPS in the form of polysaccharides by the R. planticola strain and can be applied as markers for polysaccharides in biofilm matrix. Moreover, the analysis of encapsulated bacteria can enable the identification of polysaccharides by RM. Thus, the similarities in spectral signatures in the regions 1,200\u20131,000\u00a0cm\u22121 and below 600\u00a0cm\u22121 for encapsulated R. planticola (spectrum 4) and dextran (Fig.\u00a03) suggest that in our case the R. planticola strain produced polysaccharides with dextran-like structure.The polysaccharides synthesized by microbial cells can vary greatly in their composition and hence in their chemical and physical properties. Which polysaccharides are produced depends on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors arise in accordance with the genetic profile of the microbial cell, whereas extrinsic influences include the physicochemical environment in which the microorganisms are located [8]. Further efforts will be dedicated to perform a detailed analysis of encapsulated R. planticola, grown under different environmental conditions.Raman microscopic analysis of multispecies biofilmsBased on the identification of specific bands in reference materials, RM was applied for a label-free chemical characterization of different multispecies biofilms. Figure\u00a04 shows representative microscopic images (a,c) and the corresponding spectra (b,d) of biofilm 1, cultivated with 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose under laminar flow conditions (Re\u2009=\u20091,000). The spectra in Fig.\u00a04b and d show significant differences between various structures in the biofilm matrix (Fig.\u00a04a,c). The most intense and characteristic band in spectra 1 and 2 in Fig.\u00a04b is due to the aromatic ring stretch that occurs at ca. 1,600\u00a0cm\u22121 (Table\u00a01). The accompanying band at 1,655\u00a0cm\u22121 can be assigned to the ring-conjugated C=C stretch and to the C=O stretch for the aldehyde, or to a ring-conjugated keto C=O [30, 45]. These bands are typical of the spectroscopic signature of lignin. This complex chemical compound is an integral part of the cell walls of plants, formed by the irreversible removal of water from sugars, creating aromatic structures. However, no information about lignin-like polymers in bacterial biofilms is available. The elucidation of the origin of lignin-like bands in Raman spectra will be a subject of our future biofilm studies. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a04d, the spectra from different structures of EPS matrix are characterized by strong polysaccharide [30\u201332] and/or lipopolysaccharide [46, 47] bands (Table\u00a01). This finding is in agreement with results of CLSM studies of biofilm 1 (Fig.\u00a05), where the predominant green color indicates high concentrations of glycoconjugates in the EPS matrix. The lectin Aleuria aurantia, which was used for staining, has been proven to deliver the most intense signal for glycoconjugates in heterotrophic biofilms cultivated on glucose [48]. Moreover, RM analysis reveals remarkable differences in the spectra obtained from various structures (Fig.\u00a04c) in the biofilm matrix, especially in the region of glucosidic ring vibrations between 1,200 and 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121. The relative intensities of the bands at 1,122\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,084\u00a0cm\u22121 significantly differ for spherical structures and filaments (Fig.\u00a04d). That illustrates that RM can correlate various structural appearances within the biofilm matrix to variations of its chemical composition.\nFig.\u00a04Microscopic images (a,c) and corresponding Raman spectra (b,d) of biofilm 1 (cultivated at 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose and Re\u2009=\u20091,000)Fig.\u00a05CLSM data presented as maximum intensity projection for biofilm 1 stained with AlexaFluor\u00ae 488-conjugated Aleuria aurantia lectin (green) and SYTO 60\u00ae nucleic acid stain (red), scale bar 50 \u00b5mThe RM analysis of biofilms grown on marked glass slides (see Materials and methods) under different nutrient conditions reveals a completely different chemical composition of the biofilm matrix. We studied the biofilms grown under laminar flow conditions (Re\u2009=\u20091,000) for 1 and 3\u00a0months (biofilms 2 and 3, respectively). For the initial phase of the biofilm formation (biofilm 2), the presence of aggregates and cell colonies was found to be typical (Fig.\u00a06a). Figure\u00a06b shows the spectra of cell colonies with carotenoid peaks at 1,510\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,155\u00a0cm\u22121 [13, 49, 50]. Two broad accompanying bands around 1,600\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,350\u00a0cm\u22121 can be assigned to humic-like substances [51]. The spectra of aggregates are characterized by broad bands at 420\u00a0cm\u22121 and 720\u00a0cm\u22121 as well as weak bands at 1,621\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,128\u00a0cm\u22121, which can be assigned to polysaccharides (Table\u00a01).\nFig.\u00a06Microscopic image (a) and corresponding Raman spectra (b) of biofilm 2Typically, the presence of microorganisms and protozoa in biofilms was detected to be accompanied by carotenoid bands of colored microorganisms. It has to be stated that the intensity of these bands decreases with the irradiation time (photobleaching). The advantage of this effect is that after the bleaching only the characteristic Raman bands due to cell matrix remain in the Raman spectra (data not shown).Biofilm development and maturation bring significant changes in its chemical composition. Figure\u00a07 shows microscopic image (a) and corresponding spectra (b) of biofilm 3 cultivated for more than 3\u00a0months. Raman microscopic analysis revealed high protein content in different structures of biofilm (Fig.\u00a07b and Table\u00a01). That can be explained by increased concentration of microorganisms and high number of protozoa in the biofilm matrix. CLSM analysis confirms this assumption (Fig.\u00a08): The staining of nucleic acids, employed to detect the distribution of microorganisms, and proteins illustrates good agreement in location of microorganisms and proteins.\nFig.\u00a07Microscopic image (a) and corresponding Raman spectra (b) of biofilm 3Fig.\u00a08CLSM data presented as maximum intensity projection for biofilm 3 stained with SYTO 60\u00ae nucleic acid stain (red) and SYPROOrange\u00ae protein stain (blue), scale bar 50\u00a0\u00b5mIt should be mentioned that SYTO60\u00ae applied for CLSM analysis stains intracellular as well as extracellular DNA/RNA. However, based on the clearly zoned signals of SYTO60\u00ae embedded in signals of EPS glycoconjugates (Fig.\u00a05) and proteins (Fig.\u00a08), respectively, we suggest that in the analyzed samples only intracellular nucleic acids are detected and extracellular DNA/RNA are present at a concentration below the detection limit. Thus, CLSM images reveal the embedding of microorganisms in the EPS matrix (EPS glycoconjugates and proteins; see Figs.\u00a04 and 8).ConclusionsIn the presented work, we explored the feasibility of RM for nondestructive chemical characterization of multispecies biofilms. By examining a wide range of reference samples, the characteristic frequency regions and marker bands specific for different biofilm components were identified. Moreover, the assignment of Raman bands in spectra of multispecies biofilms was performed. The results can be applied for the analysis of various macromolecules in the complex biofilm matrix and thus will help to characterize heterogeneous structures in biofilms in situ.The investigation of multispecies biofilms demonstrates that RM can correlate various structural appearances within the biofilm to variations of its chemical composition, and provides detailed chemical information about the different constituents in complex biofilm matrix. In our future work, we will focus on the RM analysis of a wide range of multispecies biofilms grown under defined nutrient and flow conditions in order to learn more about the variability of EPS and hence about their spectroscopic signatures. Moreover, we plan to apply surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for biofilm analysis that should allow us to increase the sensitivity of RM. The further efforts will also be devoted to the combination of Raman mapping with CLSM in order to study the behavior of biofilms during changing nutrient/flow conditions. Raman mapping can provide information about the spatial distribution of different substances inside the biofilm matrix and extend the structural CLSM analysis with chemical information. New and spatially resolved data on biofilm constituents can allow us to test and improve the validity of theoretical biofilm models. Moreover, the method may provide new knowledge about structure/function correlations in biofilms and help our understanding of the role that biofilms play both in the environment and technosphere.AcknowledgementsFinancial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Project HA3507/2-1 & HO1910/7-1) is gratefully acknowledged.

They can occur in a variety of environments, including in water, air, soil, and on surfaces. Biofilms are important because they play a role in many natural processes, such as wastewater treatment and biocatalysis. They also contribute to the structure of aquatic ecosystems and are a ubiquitous form of microbial life.\n\nQ2: What is the role of Raman microscopy (RM) in the study of biofilms? \nA2: Raman microscopy (RM) is a nondestructive analytical technique that provides fingerprint spectra with spatial resolution of an optical microscope. It requires no or limited sample preparation and can be used to analyze the chemical composition of complete biofilm matrices without destroying the sample. Therefore, it is an ideal technique for studying biofilms.\n\nQ3: How does the spectral analysis in Raman microscopy work? \nA3: Raman microscopic analysis of reference samples and biofilms involves the identification of specific bands in the spectra that can be attributed to different biofilm components. For instance, polysaccharides exhibit typical bands in the fingerprint region, while proteins display bands in the amide I, amide III, and ring vibrations regions. \n\nQ4: Can Raman microscopy distinguish between different types of polysaccharides? \nA4: Yes, Raman microscopy can provide detailed chemical information about the different constituents in a biofilm matrix, including different types of polysaccharides. It can reveal variations in the chemical composition of the biofilm matrix and correlate these variations with the structural appearances within the biofilm.\n\nQ5: How does the chemical composition of a biofilm change over time? \nA5: The biofilm development and maturation bring significant changes in its chemical composition. The Raman microscopic analysis revealed high protein content in different structures of the biofilm cultivated for more than 3 months. This suggests that the biofilm's chemical composition varies over time.\n\nQ6: How is the encapsulation of microorganisms by production of EPS related to the biofilm matrix? \nA6: The encapsulation of microorganisms by production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is a major process in biofilm development.

The analysis of encapsulated bacteria can help in identifying the polysaccharides present in the biofilm matrix.\n\nQ7: What are the common frequency regions and marker bands specific for different biofilm components? \nA7: The characteristic frequency regions and marker bands specific for different biofilm components were identified through the analysis of reference materials. For instance, the region of glucosidic ring vibrations between 1,200 and 1,000 cm\u22121 is characteristic for polysaccharides and predominantly with glucosidic ring vibrations. \n\nQ8: How does Raman microscopy correlate various structural appearances within the biofilm matrix to variations of its chemical composition? \nA8: Raman microscopy can correlate various structural appearances within the biofilm matrix to variations of its chemical composition. It can reveal, for instance, that encapsulated bacteria and spherical structures have different chemical compositions, as indicated by the relative intensities of the bands at 1,122 cm\u22121 and 1,084 cm\u22121 being significantly different for spherical structures and filaments.\n\nQ9: What future research directions does the paper suggest? \nA9: The paper suggests that future research should focus on the analysis of a wider range of multispecies biofilms grown under defined nutrient and flow conditions. The use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for biofilm analysis is also suggested to increase the sensitivity of Raman microscopy. \n\nQ10: How does the spatial distribution of different substances inside the biofilm matrix affect the characterization of biofilms? \nA10: Raman mapping can provide information about the spatial distribution of different substances inside the biofilm matrix. This data can help to test and improve the validity of theoretical biofilm models and gain new knowledge about structure/function correlations in biofilms.",

        "txt": "Introduction. Biofilms represent a ubiquitous form of microbial life in the natural environment. They can occur at solid\u2013liquid, solid\u2013air, liquid\u2013liquid, and liquid\u2013air interfaces [1\u20134]. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms which are embedded in a matrix formed by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Water is the major component in the biofilm matrix and can make up to 98% of the biofilm mass. Depending on the biofilm type and microorganisms involved, up to 90% of the particulate fraction of the biofilm can be EPS [5]. EPS are biopolymers of microbial origin such as polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and phospholipids. EPS play a major role in the formation and maintenance of the biofilm structure [6]. The EPS matrix mediates the cell/cell contacts (quorum sensing), protects biofilm against environmental stress, caused e.g. by antibiotics, and prevents biofilm desiccation. The actual structure of the biofilm matrix varies greatly, depending on the microbial cells present, their physiological status, the nutrients available, the prevailing environmental conditions, and the biofilm age [7, 8]. Detailed information about structure and chemical composition of the EPS matrix is needed for an optimization of biocides, antifouling strategies, and biological wastewater treatment.For in situ assessment of the biofilm structure, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has been proven to be a powerful technique that reveals a three-dimensional structural image with microscopic resolution [5, 9]. However, chemical information usually can be extracted only by special staining which is unfavorable for in situ applications and of limited specificity. As EPS are a complex mixture of different polymers with a large number of potential binding sites, the staining of the total EPS is complicated. The combination of CLSM with another technique, which allows these limitations to be overcome and provides additional chemical information about biofilm components and their distribution, is desired to improve the understanding of the composition and structure of the biofilm matrix.Raman microscopy (RM) is a nondestructive analytical technique that provides fingerprint spectra with spatial resolution of an optical microscope. It requires no or limited sample preparation. Raman spectra are characterized by a high specificity, revealing usually sharper and clearer bands than IR spectra, and low water background. As compared to IR microscopy, excitation with visible light can be employed in Raman spectroscopy, which allows the use of standard optics. The common integration of Raman spectroscopy with a microscope enables spectral analysis with micrometer spatial resolution. Moreover, no tuneable excitation source is needed, since the whole spectrum can be collected by excitation with a fixed laser wavelength.RM was applied to generate \u201cwhole-organism fingerprints\u201d for the characterization and identification of different biological systems (bacteria, yeast, pollen), since all biologically associated molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids exhibit distinct spectral features [10\u201316]. RM was used to describe the spatial distribution of the biofilm biomass by Marcotte et al. [17] and to characterize the microbial composition of a biofilm [18]. P\u00e4tzold et al. focused on the distribution of different microorganisms and other substances (minerals) inside intact multispecies biofilm. Recently, Sandt et al. [19] applied RM for studying the chemical heterogeneities of monospecies biofilm (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) cultivated in flow cell. They used the spectroscopic signature of cells (as one component) and EPS (as another component) to characterize the composition and development of biofilm. A spectrum of EPS with still unidentified bands (no chemical information about EPS composition) was obtained by subtraction of the spectrum of the EDTA-treated cells from that of the untreated cells. The feasibility of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for label-free characterization of nanostructures in biofilms was also recently tested on a model system, calcium alginate, by Schmid et al. [20].In this paper we explore the potential of RM for the nondestructive chemical characterization of multispecies biofilm matrix including microbial constituents and EPS. We analyze a wide range of reference samples (polysaccharide, proteins) that might be present in EPS matrix, microorganisms as well as encapsulated bacteria and multispecies biofilms. Thus, we demonstrate that RM can provide detailed information about chemical composition of complete biofilm matrix.Materials and methodsReference samplesThe following selection of microorganism-specific polysaccharides were analyzed by RM: cellulose (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany and ICN Biomedicals Inc., USA), dextran (6, 40,100, and 500\u00a0kDa, Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), xanthan (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), gellan (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), alginic acid (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), sodium alginate (Carl Roth, Germany), and calcium and iron(III) alginate. The last two samples were produced from sodium alginate and calcium, respectively, iron(III) chloride by the following procedure: 5\u00a0mL of a 2% solution of sodium alginate was added to a stirred solution of 10\u00a0mL of 0.2\u00a0M Ca or Fe(III) chloride and kept overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The gelled alginates were then washed with distilled water to remove unbound salt and dried at room temperature. As reference materials for proteins, albumin bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), albumin chicken egg (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and casein bovine milk (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) were chosen. In order to characterize the microorganisms in biofilms, Raman spectra of Escherichia coli (DSM 1116) and Raoultella planticola (DSM 3069), provided by the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Germany), were measured. The bacteria were cultivated in LB medium (tryptone 10\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121, yeast extract 5\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121, and NaCl 10\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121) in a shaking incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. An aliquot of 1\u00a0mL was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min. The bacterial pellet was twice resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again to remove residues of cultivation medium. Since low temperatures in general induce capsule synthesis [21], the bacterial pellets were stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h to stimulate the encapsulation of microorganisms by production of EPS.Multispecies biofilms were grown in a homemade funnel reactor as described elsewhere [22]. Briefly, the reactor consists of funnel with a working length of 1.2\u00a0m and a width of 0.072\u00a0m, manufactured from PVC. A magnetic gear pump was installed to achieve laminar (Re\u2009=\u20091,000) flow conditions. The volume of the mixing tank was exchanged five times per day. The pH value of the bulk phase was monitored continuously and set to a value between 6.5 and 7. The temperature of the cultivation medium, which was exchanged daily, was kept constant between 18 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C by a thermostat. The whole cultivation system was controlled by an automation system (Logo! 12/24RC logic module, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany). The inoculation was done with 500\u00a0mL of activated sludge supernatant from the municipal waste water treatment plant of Garching (Germany). Biofilm 1 was cultivated on glass slides with 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose for 2\u00a0months. For biofilms 2 and 3, marked glass slides (epoxy resin marking, Paul Marienfeld GmbH & Co. KG, Lauda-K\u00f6nigsfeld, Germany) were used as substratum. Samples 2 and 3 were grown for 1 or 3\u00a0months, respectively, with 3\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose, 8\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 (NH4)2SO4, 2.8\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 CaCl2, 7\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 NaNO3, 5\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 FeSO4\u00b77H2O, and 0.2\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 K2HPO4.Raman microscopyA Renishaw 2000 Raman microscope system (Renishaw, UK) was used. All measurements were carried out using a He\u2013Ne laser (\u03bb0\u2009=\u2009633\u00a0nm, 25\u00a0mW, resulting in ca. 7\u00a0mW laser power on the sample). Wavelength calibrations were performed by measuring silicon wafers through a \u00d750 objective, featuring a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.75, and evaluating the first-order phonon band of Si at 520\u00a0cm\u22121. All reference samples were analyzed on CaF2 disks by means of a \u00d750 objective. The biofilms were examined directly on glass slides with a \u00d763 water immersion objective (NA\u2009=\u20090.9, laser spot diameter ca. 1\u00a0\u00b5m), and 100\u00a0s exposure time. The cultivation media caused no noticeable signals in Raman spectra. Nevertheless, the samples were placed in homemade transparent PMMA boxes filled with tap water before analysis, according to our standard protocol for Raman measurements of biofilm grown with different nutrients. No significant bands from the glass substratum were observed. The biofilm spectra were characterized by a relatively low or moderate fluorescence background, compared with spectra obtained with \u03bb0\u2009=\u2009514\u00a0nm (data not shown).The theoretical lateral resolution of the measurements, calculated according to the Abbe formula (0.63\u03bb0/NA), was 0.44\u00a0\u00b5m. Axial resolutions of 3.5\u00a0\u00b5m and 8.5\u00a0\u00b5m were determined for confocal and semiconfocal modes, respectively. This was done by plotting the intensity of the 520\u00a0cm\u22121 band of Si as a function of distance (20\u00a0\u00b5m with 1\u00a0\u00b5m step) from the tightest focus. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the obtained curve gives us the axial resolution. The spectra of multispecies biofilms collected in confocal mode were characterized by the same spectroscopic signature as spectra obtained in semiconfocal mode and by somewhat lower signal-to-noise ratio. The biofilm spectra presented here were collected in semiconfocal mode.Spectra were processed via the WiRE 1.2 software (Renishaw, UK) running under GRAMS/32 (Thermo Galactic, USA) which also controls the Raman microscope system and data acquisition.Confocal laser scanning microscopy and digital image analysisAll CLSM data reported here were created with a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). The system is controlled by the AIM software (version 3.2, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). The microscope is equipped with different laser sources with excitation wavelengths of 351, 361, 477, 488, 514, 543, and 633\u00a0nm. A \u00d740 water immersion objective (NA\u2009=\u20090.8) was applied to examine the biofilm matrix directly on the slide. The pinhole sizes for each scan channel of the LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscopy were adjusted to scan all channels with an identical optical slice thickness [23] of 0.78\u00a0\u00b5m. Image analysis was performed with the freely available software ImageJ, version 1.39i [24], including the LSM-Reader plugin to open LSM5 formatted image stacks.The distribution of EPS glycoconjugates, nucleic acids (indicating location of microorganisms), and proteins was analyzed. EPS glycoconjugates were stained with the Aleuria aurantia lectin (LINARIS Biologische Produkte GmbH, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany), labeled with AlexaFluor\u00ae 488 (AAL 488, invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA), and nucleic acids were stained with SYTO 60\u00ae (invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) according to the protocol described by Neu et al. [25]. A combination of AAL 488 and SYTO 60\u00ae was applied following Neu et al. and Staudt et al. [25, 26]. A combination of SYTO 60\u00ae and SYPRO Orange\u00ae (invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) was used to stain nucleic acids and proteins [27].Results and discussionRaman microscopic analysis of reference samplesPolysaccharides are one major component of EPS matrix. Some polysaccharides are neutral macromolecules (cellulose, dextran) but the majority are polyanionic due to the presence of either uronic acids (alginate, xanthan), acetyl groups (xanthan, gellan), or ketal-linked pyruvate (xanthan) [28, 29].Figure\u00a01 illustrates the fingerprint Raman spectra of biofilm-specific polysaccharides. These spectra show bands in three major regions: CH/CH2 deformations at 1,500\u20131,200\u00a0cm\u22121; C\u2013C stretch, C\u2013O\u2013C glucosidic link, and ring breathing modes at 1,200\u2013950\u00a0cm\u22121; and side group deformations at 950\u2013700\u00a0cm\u22121 [30\u201332]. Additionally, C=O and COO\u2212 stretch vibrations [33] were found for alginic acid, Na alginate, xanthan, and gellan. Table\u00a01 summarizes the assignment of the Raman bands of reference samples, the biofilm matrix, and corresponding references. The comparison of the spectra from polysaccharides with various structures reveals significant differences in Raman band shapes and intensities. In particular, the regions of glucosidic ring vibrations at 1,200\u20131,000\u00a0cm\u22121 and side group deformations (and the carboxyl group stretch region in the case of polyanionic polysaccharides) contain most of the structural information and can be used for characterization of polysaccharides and identification of individual components in the EPS matrix.\nFig.\u00a01Raman spectra of biofilm-specific polysaccharidesTable\u00a01Assignment of the Raman bands of biofilm matrixPeak position (cm\u22121)AssignmentCarbohydratesProteinsDNA/RNACarotenoidsLipids1,750\u20131,735C=O str [33]C=O ester [41, 42, 46, 47]1,725C=O str [33]1,680\u20131,640Amide I [14, 40\u201343]1,660\u20131,650C=C, C=O [30]C=C, C=O [46, 47]1,650\u20131,540COO\u2212 asym [33]1,617\u20131,614C=C Tyr [40, 41, 43]; Trp [42]1,607C=C Phe [41, 43]; Tyr [42]1,600Arom ring str, lignin-like [30]1,581Trp [40]1,580\u20131,575G, A ring str [14, 41\u201343]1,550Trp [40]1,550\u20131,500C=C str [13, 49, 50]1,460\u20131,440\u03b4(CH2) scis [14, 43]; CH2 def [41, 43]\u03b4(CH2) scis [43]; CH2 def [41, 43]\u03b4(CH2) scis [43]; CH2 def [41, 43, 46]1,450\u20131,360COO\u2212 sym [33]1,345\u20131,314\u03b4(CH) [14, 42, 43]\u03b4(CH) [14, 42, 43]1,304\u20131,272CH2 twist [46, 47]1,261\u20131,266=C\u2013H in-plane def [46]1,280\u20131,200Amide III [14, 41\u201343]1,170\u20131,150C\u2013C str [13, 49, 50]1,160\u20131,150C\u2013C, C\u2013O ring breath, asym [31, 32, 46]1,127\u20131,125C\u2013C str, C\u2013O\u2013C glycosidic link; ring breath, sym [14, 30\u201332, 41, 46]C\u2013N, C\u2013C str [14, 41]C\u2013C str [41]1,095\u20131,090C\u2013C str, C\u2013O\u2013C glycosidic link; ring breath, sym [14, 30\u201332, 41, 43, 46]PO2\u2212 str, symm [42, 43]PO2\u2212 str, symm [42, 43]1,080C\u2013O\u2013H bend, C\u2013H bend [31]1,060C\u2013O, C\u2013C str [31, 41]C\u2013C; C\u2013N [41]1,020\u20131,000C\u2013CH3 def [13, 49, 50]1,000Ring breath Phe [14, 41, 43]899\u2013855C\u2013C str, C\u2013O\u2013C 1,4-glycosidic link [14, 41, 43]852Ring breath Tyr [41, 42]828Ring breath Tyr [41, 42]O\u2013P\u2013O str [42]785\u2013780C, U [14, 41, 43]760Ring breath Trp [42]730\u2013720CH2 [14]A [41]728Ring breath Trp [42]A [42]540\u2013530C\u2013O\u2013C glycosidic ring def [10, 41]480\u2013306Carbohydrates [10, 31]Abbreviations: bend bending, breath breathing, def deformation, scis scissoring, str stretching, asym asymetric, sym symetricTo characterize the influence of the biopolymer chain length on Raman spectra of polysaccharides, we examined dextran in a wide range of molecular mass (6, 40, 100, and 500\u00a0kDa). The differences in the Raman band positions and shapes were not significant (data not shown); only the relative intensity of dextran marker band at 540\u00a0cm\u22121 [34] to the band at 1,126\u00a0cm\u22121 slightly increased with increasing molecular mass from 6 to 100\u00a0kDa (1.205\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025, 1.263\u2009\u00b1\u20090.067, and 1.283\u2009\u00b1\u20090.053 for 6, 40, and 100\u00a0kDa, respectively). For higher masses it remained constant (1.268\u2009\u00b1\u20090.048 for 500\u00a0kDa). Hence, we can assume that the molecular mass (i.e., the length of the biopolymer chains) has no significant influence on the Raman spectra of polysaccharides.Multivalent cations such as Ca2+ are known to induce cross-linking of different polymer molecules as well as of different parts of the same polymer chain via binding of guluronic acid residues [35]. In alginates that are copolymers of \u03b2-D-mannuronic acid (M) and \u03b1-L-guluronic acid (G), the G\u2013G chain has a cavity-like site formed between adjacent G units into which Ca2+ ions can fit to form stable blocks that resemble the shape of an egg box. This leads to the formation of a stable supermolecular network with ordered helix structures.In order to analyze the influence of metal cations on Raman spectra of polysaccharides, we compared alginic acid with Na+, Ca2+, and Fe3+ alginic acid salts. Binding of cations induced several changes in the Raman spectra of alginates (Fig.\u00a02). For alginic acid, the band of the C=O stretch at 1,730\u00a0cm\u22121 is very strong. In a salt made of an alginic acid, asymmetric and symmetric stretch bands of the carboxyl ion (COO\u2212) appear at 1,615\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,410\u00a0cm\u22121. As compared to Na+ alginate, the symmetrical COO\u2212 peak of Ca2+ alginate exhibits a shift towards higher wavenumbers (6\u00a0cm\u22121) as well as a reduced relative intensity. An even higher shift (10\u201320\u00a0cm\u22121) was reported by Choupra et al. [35] and Schmid et al. [20] that can be explained by the use of alginates from different manufacturers and hence different G/M unit ratios. Nevertheless, these changes are in agreement with IR spectroscopy studies and can be associated to bidentate bridging of two ligands and/or chelation of one ligand [36\u201338]. For Fe3+ alginate, both C=O stretch (typical for alginic acid) and carboxyl ion stretch (typical for alginic acid salts) were observed. Moreover, significant changes in the peak positions and shapes were found in the region of the side group deformations below 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121.\nFig.\u00a02Raman spectra of alginatesIt should be mentioned that in our study we used alginates of algal origin. Commercially available alginates are usually obtained from brown algae. In comparison to algal alginates, the alginates produced by bacteria have a higher degree of polymerization. Moreover, bacterial alginates are characterized by the lack of homoguluronic units that is explained by the partial acetylation on the O-2 and O-3 positions of the M units. Acetyl groups prevent the conversion of M residues to G residues by C-5 epimerase and give bacteria a way to control the alginate composition and properties [39]. Nevertheless, algal alginates are shown to be an appropriate model to test the feasibility of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for label-free chemical characterization of nanostructures in biofilms [20]. We also applied algal alginate as a model polysaccharide to find out the frequency regions in the Raman spectra that can be used for the characterization of different polysaccharides and for the analysis of the influence of metal cations. However, the future identification of alginates in biofilm matrix will require the RM analysis of the alginates produced by bacteria.In the fingerprint region, the proteins exhibit the typical broad bands [40\u201343] from amide I near 1,650\u00a0cm\u22121 (C=O stretch, 70\u201380%; C\u2013N stretch, 10\u201330%; and N\u2013H deformation), amide III near 1,300\u00a0cm\u22121 (C\u2013N stretch, 40%; N\u2013H deformation, 30%; and C\u2013H deformation), ring vibrations from aromatic residues of tyrosine (Tyr), and phenylalanine (Phe) in the region between 1,615 and 1,605\u00a0cm\u22121 as well as a Phe band at ca. 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121 (data not shown). The band at ca. 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121 is typical for protein fingerprints, and can be used as a marker for the presence of proteins in the sample analyzed.For the characterization of the microorganisms in a biofilm by RM, we analyzed the Raman spectra of Escherichia coli and Raoultella planticola. These microorganisms, cultivated overnight, exhibit very similar spectra (1 and 2 in Fig.\u00a03) with characteristic bands of proteins (amide I, amide III, and ring vibrations from aromatic residues including the marker band of Phe at 1,002\u00a0cm\u22121), nucleic acids as well as weak bands of polysaccharides in the glucosidic ring region between 1,200 and 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121.\nFig.\u00a03Raman spectra of free E. coli (1), R. planticola (2) compared with encapsulated E. coli (3) and R. planticola (4), and polysaccharide dextranAs a reaction to environmental stress, bacteria like E. coli and especially R. planticola can produce EPS. These compounds may remain either unattached (as slime) or covalently linked (often by a phosphodiester or lipid link) to macromolecules on the cell surface [44]. In the latter case, the material may form a capsule which can be recognized microscopically and which may be attached firmly to the surface. This can make the separation of the EPS from bacteria very difficult [29]. Figure\u00a03 (spectra 3 and 4) shows significant differences in spectra of encapsulated E. coli and especially R. planticola compared with spectra of free bacteria (spectra 1 and 2). The Raman bands of R. planticola (spectrum 4) in the regions between 1,200 and 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121 and below 600\u00a0cm\u22121 are significantly stronger than those of the other strain (spectrum 3). As discussed above, these frequency ranges are characteristic for polysaccharides and associated predominantly with glucosidic ring vibrations. They indicate a substantial production of EPS in the form of polysaccharides by the R. planticola strain and can be applied as markers for polysaccharides in biofilm matrix. Moreover, the analysis of encapsulated bacteria can enable the identification of polysaccharides by RM. Thus, the similarities in spectral signatures in the regions 1,200\u20131,000\u00a0cm\u22121 and below 600\u00a0cm\u22121 for encapsulated R. planticola (spectrum 4) and dextran (Fig.\u00a03) suggest that in our case the R. planticola strain produced polysaccharides with dextran-like structure.The polysaccharides synthesized by microbial cells can vary greatly in their composition and hence in their chemical and physical properties. Which polysaccharides are produced depends on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors arise in accordance with the genetic profile of the microbial cell, whereas extrinsic influences include the physicochemical environment in which the microorganisms are located [8]. Further efforts will be dedicated to perform a detailed analysis of encapsulated R. planticola, grown under different environmental conditions.Raman microscopic analysis of multispecies biofilmsBased on the identification of specific bands in reference materials, RM was applied for a label-free chemical characterization of different multispecies biofilms. Figure\u00a04 shows representative microscopic images (a,c) and the corresponding spectra (b,d) of biofilm 1, cultivated with 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose under laminar flow conditions (Re\u2009=\u20091,000). The spectra in Fig.\u00a04b and d show significant differences between various structures in the biofilm matrix (Fig.\u00a04a,c). The most intense and characteristic band in spectra 1 and 2 in Fig.\u00a04b is due to the aromatic ring stretch that occurs at ca. 1,600\u00a0cm\u22121 (Table\u00a01). The accompanying band at 1,655\u00a0cm\u22121 can be assigned to the ring-conjugated C=C stretch and to the C=O stretch for the aldehyde, or to a ring-conjugated keto C=O [30, 45]. These bands are typical of the spectroscopic signature of lignin. This complex chemical compound is an integral part of the cell walls of plants, formed by the irreversible removal of water from sugars, creating aromatic structures. However, no information about lignin-like polymers in bacterial biofilms is available. The elucidation of the origin of lignin-like bands in Raman spectra will be a subject of our future biofilm studies. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a04d, the spectra from different structures of EPS matrix are characterized by strong polysaccharide [30\u201332] and/or lipopolysaccharide [46, 47] bands (Table\u00a01). This finding is in agreement with results of CLSM studies of biofilm 1 (Fig.\u00a05), where the predominant green color indicates high concentrations of glycoconjugates in the EPS matrix. The lectin Aleuria aurantia, which was used for staining, has been proven to deliver the most intense signal for glycoconjugates in heterotrophic biofilms cultivated on glucose [48]. Moreover, RM analysis reveals remarkable differences in the spectra obtained from various structures (Fig.\u00a04c) in the biofilm matrix, especially in the region of glucosidic ring vibrations between 1,200 and 1,000\u00a0cm\u22121. The relative intensities of the bands at 1,122\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,084\u00a0cm\u22121 significantly differ for spherical structures and filaments (Fig.\u00a04d). That illustrates that RM can correlate various structural appearances within the biofilm matrix to variations of its chemical composition.\nFig.\u00a04Microscopic images (a,c) and corresponding Raman spectra (b,d) of biofilm 1 (cultivated at 6\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 glucose and Re\u2009=\u20091,000)Fig.\u00a05CLSM data presented as maximum intensity projection for biofilm 1 stained with AlexaFluor\u00ae 488-conjugated Aleuria aurantia lectin (green) and SYTO 60\u00ae nucleic acid stain (red), scale bar 50 \u00b5mThe RM analysis of biofilms grown on marked glass slides (see Materials and methods) under different nutrient conditions reveals a completely different chemical composition of the biofilm matrix. We studied the biofilms grown under laminar flow conditions (Re\u2009=\u20091,000) for 1 and 3\u00a0months (biofilms 2 and 3, respectively). For the initial phase of the biofilm formation (biofilm 2), the presence of aggregates and cell colonies was found to be typical (Fig.\u00a06a). Figure\u00a06b shows the spectra of cell colonies with carotenoid peaks at 1,510\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,155\u00a0cm\u22121 [13, 49, 50]. Two broad accompanying bands around 1,600\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,350\u00a0cm\u22121 can be assigned to humic-like substances [51]. The spectra of aggregates are characterized by broad bands at 420\u00a0cm\u22121 and 720\u00a0cm\u22121 as well as weak bands at 1,621\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1,128\u00a0cm\u22121, which can be assigned to polysaccharides (Table\u00a01).\nFig.\u00a06Microscopic image (a) and corresponding Raman spectra (b) of biofilm 2Typically, the presence of microorganisms and protozoa in biofilms was detected to be accompanied by carotenoid bands of colored microorganisms. It has to be stated that the intensity of these bands decreases with the irradiation time (photobleaching). The advantage of this effect is that after the bleaching only the characteristic Raman bands due to cell matrix remain in the Raman spectra (data not shown).Biofilm development and maturation bring significant changes in its chemical composition. Figure\u00a07 shows microscopic image (a) and corresponding spectra (b) of biofilm 3 cultivated for more than 3\u00a0months. Raman microscopic analysis revealed high protein content in different structures of biofilm (Fig.\u00a07b and Table\u00a01). That can be explained by increased concentration of microorganisms and high number of protozoa in the biofilm matrix. CLSM analysis confirms this assumption (Fig.\u00a08): The staining of nucleic acids, employed to detect the distribution of microorganisms, and proteins illustrates good agreement in location of microorganisms and proteins.\nFig.\u00a07Microscopic image (a) and corresponding Raman spectra (b) of biofilm 3Fig.\u00a08CLSM data presented as maximum intensity projection for biofilm 3 stained with SYTO 60\u00ae nucleic acid stain (red) and SYPROOrange\u00ae protein stain (blue), scale bar 50\u00a0\u00b5mIt should be mentioned that SYTO60\u00ae applied for CLSM analysis stains intracellular as well as extracellular DNA/RNA. However, based on the clearly zoned signals of SYTO60\u00ae embedded in signals of EPS glycoconjugates (Fig.\u00a05) and proteins (Fig.\u00a08), respectively, we suggest that in the analyzed samples only intracellular nucleic acids are detected and extracellular DNA/RNA are present at a concentration below the detection limit. Thus, CLSM images reveal the embedding of microorganisms in the EPS matrix (EPS glycoconjugates and proteins; see Figs.\u00a04 and 8).ConclusionsIn the presented work, we explored the feasibility of RM for nondestructive chemical characterization of multispecies biofilms. By examining a wide range of reference samples, the characteristic frequency regions and marker bands specific for different biofilm components were identified. Moreover, the assignment of Raman bands in spectra of multispecies biofilms was performed. The results can be applied for the analysis of various macromolecules in the complex biofilm matrix and thus will help to characterize heterogeneous structures in biofilms in situ.The investigation of multispecies biofilms demonstrates that RM can correlate various structural appearances within the biofilm to variations of its chemical composition, and provides detailed chemical information about the different constituents in complex biofilm matrix. In our future work, we will focus on the RM analysis of a wide range of multispecies biofilms grown under defined nutrient and flow conditions in order to learn more about the variability of EPS and hence about their spectroscopic signatures. Moreover, we plan to apply surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for biofilm analysis that should allow us to increase the sensitivity of RM. The further efforts will also be devoted to the combination of Raman mapping with CLSM in order to study the behavior of biofilms during changing nutrient/flow conditions. Raman mapping can provide information about the spatial distribution of different substances inside the biofilm matrix and extend the structural CLSM analysis with chemical information. New and spatially resolved data on biofilm constituents can allow us to test and improve the validity of theoretical biofilm models.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is an exploitation of DNA replication, the mechanism responsible for DNA copying in all living cells. Although the principle was first described by Kleppe et al. [1] as replication repair, it was not until the introduction of thermostable DNA polymerases [2] that it became widely applicable. With two primers, each corresponding to one end of the DNA segment to be amplified by PCR, the DNA segment can be amplified exponentially within reasonable time (usually less than 3\u00a0h to obtain 109\u00a0copies). Now widely used, the major limitations for PCR-based detection of DNA derived from genetically modified (GM) organisms (GMOs) are access to information about applicable PCR primers and access to DNA suitable for reliable analysis. Although, several PCR primer pairs for GMO analysis have been developed and published within the last 5\u201310\u00a0years, many of these primer pairs have a limited range of application (e.g. primers suitable only for screening). For the majority of GMOs authorised on a worldwide basis there are currently no published primer pairs suitable for reliable identification or quantification. Sequence information describing the genetic modifications is usually kept confidential by biotech companies, and hitherto certified reference materials have been available for only four GMOs [3]. Presently only two of these reference materials are available: Series\u00a0410S (RoundupReady soybean, and 413 (Mon810 maize) [3]. This of course makes method development and validation difficult. Grinding, heating, acid treatment and other processing rapidly degrades DNA, and refining can lead to efficient removal of DNA. As a consequence, many products contain little GMO-derived DNA, and this DNA is often of low quality. Even with access to suitable primers, a reliable analytical result may therefore not be achievable due to template DNA restrictions. GMO testing may be limited to a simple screening PCR. However, specific identification of the GMO from which DNA is derived, or reliable quantification of the GMO-derived DNA rapidly increases the costs, in particular as the number of GMOs for which to test increases. Development of cost efficient testing schemes and multiplexing of tests have therefore recently been given increasing attention. PCR target sequences: categories and applicationsPCR-based GMO tests can be grouped into at least four categories (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a01) corresponding to their level of specificity. Each category corresponds to the composition of the DNA fragment that is amplified in the PCR. Here it may be helpful to understand the process of transformation (development of a GMO). Note also at this point that a GMO is defined by a unique transformation event. Thus, Mon809 and Mon810 maize are considered as two different GMOs although both belong to the same species (Zea mays) and were transformed with the same plasmid (pV-ZMBK07) [4]. Although transformation could mean deletion or substitution of a part of an organism's genome, transformation usually means insertion of a gene construct into the recipient organism. For simplicity, we will refer only to the latter in the following. The gene construct is composed of several elements, usually at least a gene of interest, a promoter functioning as a start signal, and a terminator functioning as a stop signal for regulation of gene expression (Fig.\u00a01). In addition, the construct may be flanked by DNA from the cloning vector. Fig.\u00a01. A schematic representation of a typical gene construct and four types of PCR-based assays showing increasing specificity (from top to bottom). H host genomic DNA, P promoter element, E enhancer element, G gene of interest, T = terminator. The gene construct is composed of P\u2013T and has been inserted into HTable\u00a01.

The most commonly used cloning vectors are pBR322 and its descendants (e.g. pUC19) containing a gene coding for resistance to ampicillin (bla) antibiotics, or vectors containing a gene coding for resistance to neomycin/kanamycin (nptII) antibiotics. Consequently, PCR methods of category\u00a01 (Fig.\u00a01) targeting the P-35S, T-35S, T-Nos, bla or nptII, have wide applications for screening for genetically modified material [4]. However, these screening methods cannot be used to identify the GMO, since the presence of one of the screening targets does not necessarily imply the presence of GMO-derived DNA. The source of P-35S or T-35S could be naturally occurring CaMV [5], and it is generally believed that Agrobacterium or other soil bacteria containing one or more of the targets are present in soil. It should be noted, though, that the natural prevalence of the targets found in GMOs has not been carefully assessed (K. Nielsen, University of Troms\u00f8, Norway, 2002, personal communication). An additional source of uncertainty may be presence of cloning vector DNA in the DNA polymerase, for example AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems) contains amplifiable bla DNA (Fig.\u00a02). Fig.\u00a02. Evidence for presence of bla DNA in AmpliTaq DNA-polymerase. Left lane positive control pBR322, middle lane no-template control (H2O), right lane size ladder. The length of the amplified product is 104\u00a0bp. No similar product was obtained with primers designed to yield larger ampliconsCategory\u00a02, gene-specific methodsThe gene of interest may also be of a natural origin, but is often slightly modified, for example by truncation or altered codon usage [6]. Furthermore, the choice of available genes is much greater than the choice of available promoters and terminators. Consequently, PCR methods targeting the gene of interest (category\u00a02, Fig.\u00a01) are more specific than category\u00a01 methods. Normally a positive signal with a category\u00a02 method implies that GM-derived DNA is present, and in many cases it will even be possible to identify from which GMO the DNA is derived. Category\u00a03, construct-specific methodsMethods of category\u00a03 target junctions between adjacent elements of the gene construct, for example between the promoter and the gene of interest (Fig.\u00a01). With these methods a positive signal will only appear in the presence of GM-derived material, and even more often than with category\u00a02 methods will it be possible to identify the GM source of the DNA. However, the full gene construct may have been transformed into more than one GMO, or may be used in future transformations, for example pV-ZMBK07 and pVZMGT10 into the following GM maize: Mon809 (1\u00a0copy of both), Mon810 (1\u00a0copy of the former), Mon832 (1\u00a0copy of the latter) and Mon80100 (unknown number of copies, possibly other related plasmids) [4].Category\u00a04, event-specific methodsThe only unique signature of a transformation event (within the limitations of present day technology) is the junction at the integration locus between the recipient genome and the inserted DNA. This junction is the target of category\u00a04 (event-specific) methods (Fig.\u00a01). Gene stackingUnfortunately, even the event-specific methods have their limitations. When two GMOs are crossed (e.g. two different GM maize such as T25 and Mon810), the resulting hybrid offspring may contain the genetic modifications including the signatures of both events and will be indistinguishable from its two parents in a PCR test (unless the test is performed on DNA from a single plant, tissue or kernel/seed/grain). This phenomenon is referred to as gene stacking. In the USA this type of hybrid GMO is not regulated if both parent GMOs are authorised. In Europe, however, the hybrid is treated as a new GMO and requires separate authorisation. Not only does this create a problem with respect to identification, but it also creates a potential problem for quantitation. If a gene-stacked GM maize is authorised, then 0.6% gene-stacked hybrid shall be treated as a 0.6% GM maize according to EU legislation [7], but PCR tests would report 0.6% GM maize\u00a0A\u00a0+\u00a00.6% GM maize\u00a0B, that is 1.2% GM maize altogether. Reference targets: species or taxon specificFor quantitation, the copy number of the GM PCR target relative to genome copies of the corresponding species is important because the principle of quantitation of GM content is to compare the relative ratio of these two. Usually, a PCR targeting a species-specific single copy gene is used to determine the amount of the species derived DNA, for example the soybean lectin gene for soya-derived DNA. Thus, in addition to the four categories listed above, we also need PCR methods for the reference targets. In a diploid organism, each cell contains two copies of a single copy gene, while a tetraploid contains four copies per cell. If the GM-specific target is inserted in a single copy, then quantitation becomes relatively simple. In RoundupReady soybean the full-length gene construct is inserted in a single copy, and through backcrossing the diploid GMO has been made homozygous. Thus, in this case each GM cell has a 1:1 ratio of the GM target and the lectin gene. However, if the GM-specific target is inserted in several copies, quantitation becomes more uncertain, in particular if the exact number of inserted copies is unknown. Heterozygosity and ploidy level can introduce additional uncertainty, and testing on single plants, tissues or kernels/seeds/grains may be required to control these parameters. PCR-based quantitationQuantitation must be relative to something. In European legislation [7] it is relative to the ingredient (e.g. maize flour) usually interpreted on a weight basis, but in principle it could also be relative to a specified amount (volume or weight) of a matrix (e.g. beer or bread), or number of units (particles, DNA or protein molecules, etc.). Unfortunately, there is no exact relationship between weight or number of grains and DNA molecules. Yet, it is generally agreed that the best estimates we can obtain with analytical methods build on the assumption that the number of DNA molecules obtained from one weight unit or grain is the same, independent of GM or non-GM origin. Berdal and Holst\u2013Jensen [8] used a well-characterised food matrix produced with 10% w/w GM soybeans, and yet consistently estimated the GM content to be approximately 12% based on DNA ratios. This could be due to different DNA content per weight unit of the raw materials used for production of the food matrix (GM relative to non-GM soybeans). Because the analytical uncertainty of quantitative PCR methods is generally assumed to be around 25% for the best PCR methods available [9], it has been difficult to estimate the uncertainty introduced by variation between different cultivars, harvests and grains. Competitive PCRThe first quantitative PCR tests were based on competitive PCR [10, 11, 12] (Fig.\u00a03, Table\u00a02). Quantitation is done by comparison of the amount of end product (end-point quantitation), that is when the PCR reaction is completed. Two target sequences with very similar features and amplifiability are co-amplified in a single reaction tube. Because the two targets compete for available nucleotides, primers and DNA polymerases, the relative quantity of end product is assumed to correspond to the relative quantity at the beginning of the first PCR cycle. Competitive PCR requires development of suitable competitor molecules, and is highly sensitive to the starting concentrations and dilution of template DNAs. It involves massive pipetting of amplified DNA and visualisation by agarose gel electrophoresis, associated with a significant risk of cross contamination. Therefore, it is gradually being replaced with more sophisticated alternatives, in particular real-time PCR.Fig.\u00a03. Double competitive PCR. Drawing of agarose gel, with GM-specific amplifications (G1\u2013G6) on the left and reference (plant species)-specific amplifications (P1\u2013P6) on the right. A molecular size marker (M) is included on either side and between the series. For each of the two targets, a series (e.g. fourfold) of dilutions, and a competitor molecule is made. The competitor should be as similar to the target, and at the same time distinguishable from target, as possible. The same quantity of competitor (e.g. 250\u00a0copies) is added to each dilution. Because competitor and target will compete for reagents, the initial copy number ratio is approximately maintained at the end point of the reaction. When the copy numbers of competitor and target are the same, both will yield the same quantity of amplification product, visible as bands of equal intensity (equilibrium). The points of equilibrium (GE and PE) for the series are visualised by white boxes. GE=(G3+G4)/2, while PE=P3. Usually, the P\u00a0series will have to be diluted (e.g. 10-fold) relative to the G\u00a0series, because the GMO content is much lower than 100%. The GM content can be calculated using the formula GE/PE multiplied by 100%. The present example corresponds to a GM content of 5%Table\u00a02.

Fig.\u00a04 and Table\u00a02). Fluorescence signal corresponding to increased amount of amplification product can be measured and visualised on a computer screen. Software can immediately convert the signal into quantitative estimates. This speeds up quantitation, and the risk of cross contamination is low. With the fastest available alternative quantitative results can be made available within approximately 30\u00a0min from the beginning of the first PCR cycle. In comparison, competitive PCR would require at least 3\u00a0h, usually more. Quantitation can either be done by direct comparison of the Ct-values of the two (\u0394Ct-method) or by comparison with a standard curve. The advantage of standard curve quantitation is that Ct-values are compared only with Ct-values of the same amplicon. So with standard curve quantitation, the final quantitative estimate is based on comparing estimated quantity of GM to estimated quantity of reference. The estimate is therefore the ratio of quantity to quantity, not of PCR cycle to PCR cycle. Real-time PCR requires very expensive laboratory equipment, and therefore cheaper alternatives giving similar accuracy and comparable throughput are welcomed.Fig.\u00a04. Real-time PCR. Each amplification reaction is shown as a separate coloured graph. The fluorescence released in response to synthesis of the target amplicon is measured in real-time. The increase in amplification products in the initial PCR cycles is too small to be detectable (dotted lines), but as the reaction proceeds it enters a phase where the increase can be visualised as a linear increase in signal (the log linear phase, shown as solid lines). When the signal corresponds to a threshold level (the baseline, green horizontal line), the corresponding cycle number for the reaction is scored (Ct-value). Quantitation can be done using a direct comparison of Ct-values (\u0394Ct method), or by comparison of copy numbers derived from a standard curve (standard curve method). For an unknown sample two reactions of the same concentration of the template DNA must be performed, one targeting a reference (R), and one targeting a GM-specific (G) sequence. The two reactions representing unknown sample shown in the figure are the black stippled graphs. The difference in Ct (\u0394Ct) for the two targets (\u0394Ct=CtG\u2212CtR) can be used directly to estimate the GM content using the formula \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${1 \\over {2^{\\Delta Ct} }} \\times 100\\%  = {\\rm GM}\\% $$ \\end{document}However, the use of \u0394 Ct for quantitation is only valid if the two targets are amplified with the same efficiency. The use of the standard curve method is not limited by such a requirement. With this method, a standard curve based on amplification of a series of reactions with known initial target copy number is established for each of the two targets. A regression line (the standard curve) relates initial target copy number to Ct-value, consequently allowing for conversion of the Ct-values of the unknown sample to initial target copy numbers. For simplicity, only one standard curve is shown in the figure, meant to represent the standard curves of both R and G. The GM content can be estimated by comparison of the initial target copy numbers of the two targets, using the formula \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{N_G } \\over {N_R }} \\times 100\\%  = {\\rm GM}\\% $$\\end{document} In the example shown, \u0394Ct=30.0\u221223.3=6.7, corresponding to approximately 1% GM. The same result is observed with the standard curve method, since NG=102 and NR=104Multiplex quantitationAlternatives to competitive PCR, yet building on end-point quantitation, include at least two ways of analysing populations of PCR reaction products from multiplex PCR developed within the European shared cost action Qpcrgmofood. Rudi and Holck [13] have developed a method where short oligonucleotide probes are labelled immediately after the PCR reaction, and where there is a linear relationship between the quantity of labelled probe and the quantity of the corresponding amplification product. The reactions are successively analysed by array hybridisation of the probes, and the identity of positives and quantitation is done by image analysis. Garcia\u2013Ca\u00f1as et al. [14] recently published a qualitative assay for duplex analysis and identification of the PCR reaction products from GMOs by capillary gel electrophoresis. Burns et al. [15] have recently developed a similar assay which is quantitative and includes three reaction products. Detection and quantification limitsThe limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) are defined as the lowest quantities that can be reliably detected and quantified, respectively. This may sound straightforward, but certainly is not. No subject, maybe apart from discussion on how to obtain suitable biological materials, has gained comparable attention or created more intense debate among experts on GMO analysis. Berdal and Holst\u2013Jensen [8] proposed to use absolute copy numbers of the target amplicons as the basis for establishing the LOD and LOQ, and to distinguish between the LOD/LOQ of the method (usually determined through a validation study as a relative value, e.g. 0.1%) and the practical LOD/LOQ (which can only be determined from results of analyses of the test sample). Purchasers of GMO tests are not a homogeneous group. Yet, they all expect the test reports to provide information about the analytical sample. Despite this fact, most certificates from test laboratories report the LOD and LOQ of the method, referring to relative percentage values from the method validation where DNA of high quality from a pure single taxon matrix is used. This situation is quite different from the situation with many analytical samples of commercial products. Such samples are often processed, may contain mixtures of (DNA from) several taxa, and the amount of high-quality DNA available in a PCR may be much lower than what is required if the reported (method specific) LOD and LOQ should be applicable. This is well known by the test laboratories, but because this knowledge requires insight in the technicalities of the analytical methods, it is less well known by competent authorities and companies purchasing the GMO tests. The practice clearly leads to misinterpretation, and could even be characterised as fraud, although a number of other factors to some extent may justify the practice. If the customer is unable to interpret a more correct test report referring to practical (sample specific) LOD/LOQ values, misinterpretation could still be the consequence, and stating that the LOD and LOQ are near or above the threshold for labelling might scare the customer from purchasing more tests from the test laboratory. The best solution to this challenge in our opinion would be a two-phased approach in which one 1) actively communicates to the competent authorities and other purchasers of GMO tests that there is a need for incorporation of test-specific LOD/LOQ values in test reports and legislation, and 2) tries to provide simple and interpretable expressions of the LOD/LOQ values in the test reports. Although this is a challenge, it is not an impossible thing to do. Determination of the practical LOD/LOQ must be DNA copy number based, but the values can be converted and expressed as relative percentages which we believe are easier to interpret relative to legislation. The LOD is the lowest concentration of the analyte at which the presence of the analyte will be detected with more than 95% probability. The LOD may therefore be determined by setting up a series of concentrations of the analyte and performing a statistically sufficient number of replicate analyses. This principle does not specify whether the analyte concentration is in DNA molecule copy numbers or relative percentages of DNA molecules. This freedom allows an LOD of five GM-DNA copies to be expressed very differently. Such an LOD may be applicable for a wide range of sample types. If it is expressed as LOD\u00a0=\u00a00.0001% (such a value may be reached under highly optimised conditions with five GM-DNA copies in a background of 5\u00d7106\u00a0haploid reference genomes of the corresponding species), then the expressed LOD would not be applicable with more complex or processed sample types (e.g. with 500\u00a0reference genomes mixed with a majority of DNA from other taxa). If, on the other hand, it is expressed as LOD\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0copies, then the LOD is not easily interpreted by non-experts. Furthermore, such a way of expressing the LOD is not harmonised with the legislation [7].If the genome size of the target taxon (e.g. soybean) is known and the DNA content in a pure DNA sample can be precisely determined, then a sample containing any relative percentage can be mixed by combining DNA from a non-GM plant specimen and a GM plant specimen, and the absolute copy numbers of the target taxon and GMO-specific sequences can be estimated reliably in these samples. Estimates of genome sizes are available [35], and quantitative methods frequently refer to these estimates. The estimates are sometimes given as ranges, in which case an analytical uncertainty is introduced if genome size is a parameter in the quantitation equation. Yet, genome sizes may prove very useful. Methods to determine the DNA content in a sample may yield considerable variation. One method that has been demonstrated to yield a high degree of correspondence between the estimated DNA content and PCR tests is based on SYBR Green fluorescence measurements [8]. No estimates of the measurement uncertainty of this method are currently available, but we find it reasonable to assume that it can be compared with the relative uncertainty introduced by mixing GM and non-GM materials in the preparation of CRMs on the basis of weight ratio. This would imply that in principle samples containing any concentration in absolute copy numbers or relative percentages of GMO relative to the target taxon can be prepared by mixing of DNA from a single GM specimen and a single non-GM specimen. The advantage of this should be obvious. It would allow determination of the full dynamic range of the method, it would allow a more precise determination of the LOD/LOQ of the method in absolute copy numbers, and it would allow the DNA-based method to be validated on the basis of DNA molecule ratios rather than on weight ratios. The latter would harmonise better with the basis for GM quantification with PCR.For the purpose of preparing samples as described above, DNA extracted from for example leaves of a single plant individual would be perfect. Such material can be obtained from a plant growing out of a single seed for example from a contaminated feed lot. Such seeds are not covered by patent protection, and thus property rights should not limit the access to biological material. Before the actual LOD and LOQ of a test can be estimated, it is important to take into consideration a few additional factors. The first factor is sampling. A single tomato is either GM or non-GM, while a corn cob may be composed of GM and non-GM kernels if the maternal DNA (the plant on which the cob is produced) is non-GM and some of the paternal DNA (from pollen) is GM. The number of units that can be GM must therefore be taken into consideration. In a sample of 10,000\u00a0tomatoes or maize kernels, a single GM tomato or kernel corresponds to 0.01%. Thus, the LOD cannot be less than 0.01% even if the tomatoes or kernels are converted to a pulp of billions of particles. If DNA is extracted from 106\u00a0particles then a single GM particle would correspond to 0.0001%. Thus, even if a single particle may contain many more haploid reference genomes, the LOD cannot be less than 0.0001%.The next aspect to consider is statistics, related to the distribution of units in a volume. This is often assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, giving a cumulative probability of drawing positives. However, distribution may be heterogeneous and aggregated. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether distribution is homogeneous and random throughout the analytical procedure, starting with sampling and terminating with the PCR. Estimating the LOD and LOQ for the PCR analysis alone is probably the simplest part of estimating the true LOD/LOQ of the final test, because we have good reason to assume that DNA is Poisson distributed in a liquid solution. The minimum copy number that can be detected is one. Thus, the theoretical absolute LOD (absLOD)\u22651\u00a0single copy. A Poisson distribution gives us a 95% probability of including at least one copy if the nominal number is 5\u00a0copies in the PCR [8, 36]. Thus, the real absLOD\u22655\u00a0copies for any target DNA in a single PCR. The relative LOD (relLOD in %) is determined by the ratio of the GM-specific absLOD (absLODGM) to observed haploid reference genomes in the PCR (REFOBSPCR). If the number of haploid reference genomes is maximized (REFMAXPCR), such as would typically be the case in a validation study, then the method-specific relLOD (relLODMETHOD) is determined: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${}^{{\\rm rel}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm METHOD}}  = {{{}^{{\\rm abs}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm GM}} } \\over {{}^{{\\rm REF}}{\\rm MAX}_{{\\rm PCR}} }} \\times 100\\% $$\n\\end{document}If the number of haploid reference genomes is the result of a specific observation for the unknown that is being tested, then the practical LOD of the sample (relLODSAMPLE) is determined: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${}^{{\\rm rel}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm SAMPLE}}  = {{{}^{{\\rm abs}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm GM}} } \\over {{}^{{\\rm REF}}{\\rm OBS}_{{\\rm PCR}} }} \\times 100\\% $$\n\\end{document}Similar calculations can be performed for LOQ, which normally is between 5\u201310\u00a0times the LOD. Increasing the number of replicates can improve the relLOD and relLOQ, but only because it means an increase in REFOBSPCR. The true LOD/LOQ of the test is always the cumulative LOD/LOQ of all the analytical steps, and the most important limiting factor is the analytical step that yields the worst LOD/LOQ. A direct observation from the relationships outlined above is that the relLOQSAMPLE is >100% if the REFOBSPCR is less than the absLOQGM. This is indeed sometimes the case with highly processed materials. Method development in the Qpcrgmofood projectWithin the project \"Reliable, Standardised, Specific, Quantitative Detection of Genetically Modified Food\" funded by the European Commission under the Fifth Framework program (Qpcrgmofood; contract no.\u00a0QLK1-1999-01301) a number of real-time quantitative PCR methods have been developed and published [8, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] and several additional papers presenting new methods are in preparation. The project was partially initiated through discussions in a working group of the European Committee for Normalisation (CEN), where the need for development of new and more reliable methods was identified. One of the objectives of the project is to provide validated methods to CEN. The project is composed of 6\u00a0workpackages; DNA extraction, reference genes, characterisation of event-specific sequence motifs, detection and quantitation method development, method validation, and socio-economic studies in relation to traceability and GM detection methods. DNA extraction is important because the most limiting factor with respect to the LOD/LOQ of the PCR test is the quality and quantity of template DNA. Reference genes play a very important role in the context of quantitation. Yet, the Qpcrgmofood project is the first project where the copy number and allelic stability of the reference gene-specific PCR targets are assessed across a wide range of available cultivars of the corresponding taxon and against non-target taxa. This has made it possible to distinguish between reliable and unreliable reference genes and primers, and to develop primers for new genes and taxa. The first paper presenting these results has already been published [20] and additional papers are in preparation. Several of these genes are presently in the process of being validated in collaborative trials and will successively be proposed as standards for CEN/ISO. Characterisation of event-specific sequence motifs is required to obtain sequence information for development of event-specific methods. In addition this also provides better insight into the actual process of transformation and can be used to verify and update the genetic maps of GMOs (e.g. [37]).Validation of PCR methodsValidation of GMO detection and quantitation methods is not straightforward, because of problems connected to availability, type and quality of reference materials, principles of quantitation, expression of the LOD and LOQ, and applicability of LOD and LOQ on different types of samples. There are essentially three critical components in a validation study: the method, the test material, and the performance of the participants. Prior to validation in a collaborative trial the method must be optimised and prevalidated. This may include publication in a peer-reviewed journal, allowing other scientists and laboratories to evaluate and criticise the method. More important, however, may be the organisation of a prevalidation trial among a small number of independent laboratories, similar to a full-scale collaborative trial. The objective of the prevalidation study should be to confirm that the method is suitable for the full-scale collaborative trial, including determination of the among- and within-laboratory variation. In the Qpcrgmofood project, such trials are performed for every method, and to select among alternative methods where more than one alternative exists for the same purpose.The test material must be referable to a standardised commodity. For GMOs, analytical methods are usually validated with CRMs. However, CRMs are presently only available for two GMOs, and their suitability for validation of real-time quantitative PCR methods may be questioned. First of all, the PCR methods can only be used to quantify the GMO content on the basis of genome equivalents (relative ratios of DNA molecules), while the CRMs are produced on the basis of weight equivalents. Since the number of DNA molecules in one unit of GM may differ from that of non-GM, a significant error may be introduced at this point. Secondly, to assure that the CRMs are sufficiently homogeneous the material used in the production of CRMs is ground to minimise the particle size variation [38], but a consequence is that much of the DNA is degraded [29]. Thirdly, the CRMs are only available in low relative percentage concentrations (0\u20135%), but the dynamic range of a method may include the 100% level. Fourthly, CRMs are pure, single-ingredient matrices. Validation based solely on CRMs may therefore give the wrong impression of the LOD and in particular the LOQ, for example if the absLOQGM varies with the total amount of template DNA in the PCR. In a recent study [29] such alteration was demonstrated for an event-specific real-time quantitative method targeting Bt11 maize by addition of soybean DNA. Similar results have been observed in our laboratory with an event-specific method targeting RoundupReady soybean (RRS) [8, unpublished data]. In the preparation of validation studies within the Qpcrgmofood-project, we have been confronted with a few particularly difficult questions concerning the selection of suitable test materials, and the expression of LOD and LOQ in relative percentages versus DNA copy numbers. In the project, event-specific methods are developed on the basis of sequence data obtained from characterisation of biological materials that may or may not be of certified origin, depending on the GMO. Sequences obtained from for example contaminated seed or feed samples, may be questioned, even if a sequence contig is obtained that matches perfectly with the description of the GMO in public databases, for example Agbios [4]. As a consequence, the methods developed on the basis of sequence data may or may not be questioned, depending on the source of the sequence data. One solution that we have considered within the Qpcrgmofood project is to submit the sequence data and method to the company producing the GMO, accompanied by a request for biological material and/or verification of the sequence data. However, this will require collaboration by companies that hitherto have been restrictive in their distribution of materials and sequence data, and could lead to restrictions or delays in publication. Another solution could be to validate the method with the available material or cloned DNA fragments [33], stating the limitation of the validity of the results associated with the degree of uncertainty regarding the origin of the material. Whether it is acceptable from the standpoint of CEN or other standardising bodies is an important question. The conclusions at this point may have a strong impact on the number of GMOs for which methods can be made available and validated. Even if the sequence data are not questioned, the suitability of the test materials for testing the specificity may be questioned if they are derived from another source than the sequence data, for example if the sequence data is from a CRM, while the test material is produced from dried leaf material of a single plant specimen. We would argue that the specificity of the method is assured by design of the method to detect and quantify the event-specific integration junction using a highly specific hybridisation probe, for example a TaqMan probe. Consequently, we do not find such criticism against the use of non-certified material in a validation study justified, if the sequence data is not questioned. Final conclusionsThe major challenges in the field of PCR-based GM detection methods are the accessibility of GM-derived material, the DNA extraction methods, efficient cost reductions and multiplexing, and implementation of sample-specific expressions of the LOD and LOQ. Method availability and validation is heavily influenced by these challenges, as well as by available resources invested. The major achievements made within the last couple of years, in particular in the context of the Qpcrgmofood project include identification of reliable species-specific reference genes for particularly important crop plants, characterisation of transformation events, development of event-specific quantitative methods for several GMOs, as well as of multiplex methods, better understanding and expression of the LOD and LOQ in PCR tests for GMOs, and improved strategies for validation of GMO detection methods.

        "txt": "Introduction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is an exploitation of DNA replication, the mechanism responsible for DNA copying in all living cells. Although the principle was first described by Kleppe et al. [1] as replication repair, it was not until the introduction of thermostable DNA polymerases [2] that it became widely applicable. With two primers, each corresponding to one end of the DNA segment to be amplified by PCR, the DNA segment can be amplified exponentially within reasonable time (usually less than 3\u00a0h to obtain 109\u00a0copies). Now widely used, the major limitations for PCR-based detection of DNA derived from genetically modified (GM) organisms (GMOs) are access to information about applicable PCR primers and access to DNA suitable for reliable analysis. Although, several PCR primer pairs for GMO analysis have been developed and published within the last 5\u201310\u00a0years, many of these primer pairs have a limited range of application (e.g. primers suitable only for screening). For the majority of GMOs authorised on a worldwide basis there are currently no published primer pairs suitable for reliable identification or quantification. Sequence information describing the genetic modifications is usually kept confidential by biotech companies, and hitherto certified reference materials have been available for only four GMOs [3]. Presently only two of these reference materials are available: Series\u00a0410S (RoundupReady soybean, and 413 (Mon810 maize) [3]. This of course makes method development and validation difficult. Grinding, heating, acid treatment and other processing rapidly degrades DNA, and refining can lead to efficient removal of DNA. As a consequence, many products contain little GMO-derived DNA, and this DNA is often of low quality. Even with access to suitable primers, a reliable analytical result may therefore not be achievable due to template DNA restrictions. GMO testing may be limited to a simple screening PCR. However, specific identification of the GMO from which DNA is derived, or reliable quantification of the GMO-derived DNA rapidly increases the costs, in particular as the number of GMOs for which to test increases. Development of cost efficient testing schemes and multiplexing of tests have therefore recently been given increasing attention. PCR target sequences: categories and applicationsPCR-based GMO tests can be grouped into at least four categories (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a01) corresponding to their level of specificity. Each category corresponds to the composition of the DNA fragment that is amplified in the PCR. Here it may be helpful to understand the process of transformation (development of a GMO). Note also at this point that a GMO is defined by a unique transformation event. Thus, Mon809 and Mon810 maize are considered as two different GMOs although both belong to the same species (Zea mays) and were transformed with the same plasmid (pV-ZMBK07) [4]. Although transformation could mean deletion or substitution of a part of an organism's genome, transformation usually means insertion of a gene construct into the recipient organism. For simplicity, we will refer only to the latter in the following. The gene construct is composed of several elements, usually at least a gene of interest, a promoter functioning as a start signal, and a terminator functioning as a stop signal for regulation of gene expression (Fig.\u00a01). In addition, the construct may be flanked by DNA from the cloning vector. Fig.\u00a01. A schematic representation of a typical gene construct and four types of PCR-based assays showing increasing specificity (from top to bottom). H host genomic DNA, P promoter element, E enhancer element, G gene of interest, T = terminator. The gene construct is composed of P\u2013T and has been inserted into HTable\u00a01.

The most commonly used cloning vectors are pBR322 and its descendants (e.g. pUC19) containing a gene coding for resistance to ampicillin (bla) antibiotics, or vectors containing a gene coding for resistance to neomycin/kanamycin (nptII) antibiotics. Consequently, PCR methods of category\u00a01 (Fig.\u00a01) targeting the P-35S, T-35S, T-Nos, bla or nptII, have wide applications for screening for genetically modified material [4]. However, these screening methods cannot be used to identify the GMO, since the presence of one of the screening targets does not necessarily imply the presence of GMO-derived DNA. The source of P-35S or T-35S could be naturally occurring CaMV [5], and it is generally believed that Agrobacterium or other soil bacteria containing one or more of the targets are present in soil. It should be noted, though, that the natural prevalence of the targets found in GMOs has not been carefully assessed (K. Nielsen, University of Troms\u00f8, Norway, 2002, personal communication). An additional source of uncertainty may be presence of cloning vector DNA in the DNA polymerase, for example AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems) contains amplifiable bla DNA (Fig.\u00a02). Fig.\u00a02. Evidence for presence of bla DNA in AmpliTaq DNA-polymerase. Left lane positive control pBR322, middle lane no-template control (H2O), right lane size ladder. The length of the amplified product is 104\u00a0bp. No similar product was obtained with primers designed to yield larger ampliconsCategory\u00a02, gene-specific methodsThe gene of interest may also be of a natural origin, but is often slightly modified, for example by truncation or altered codon usage [6]. Furthermore, the choice of available genes is much greater than the choice of available promoters and terminators. Consequently, PCR methods targeting the gene of interest (category\u00a02, Fig.\u00a01) are more specific than category\u00a01 methods. Normally a positive signal with a category\u00a02 method implies that GM-derived DNA is present, and in many cases it will even be possible to identify from which GMO the DNA is derived. Category\u00a03, construct-specific methodsMethods of category\u00a03 target junctions between adjacent elements of the gene construct, for example between the promoter and the gene of interest (Fig.\u00a01). With these methods a positive signal will only appear in the presence of GM-derived material, and even more often than with category\u00a02 methods will it be possible to identify the GM source of the DNA. However, the full gene construct may have been transformed into more than one GMO, or may be used in future transformations, for example pV-ZMBK07 and pVZMGT10 into the following GM maize: Mon809 (1\u00a0copy of both), Mon810 (1\u00a0copy of the former), Mon832 (1\u00a0copy of the latter) and Mon80100 (unknown number of copies, possibly other related plasmids) [4].Category\u00a04, event-specific methodsThe only unique signature of a transformation event (within the limitations of present day technology) is the junction at the integration locus between the recipient genome and the inserted DNA. This junction is the target of category\u00a04 (event-specific) methods (Fig.\u00a01). Gene stackingUnfortunately, even the event-specific methods have their limitations. When two GMOs are crossed (e.g. two different GM maize such as T25 and Mon810), the resulting hybrid offspring may contain the genetic modifications including the signatures of both events and will be indistinguishable from its two parents in a PCR test (unless the test is performed on DNA from a single plant, tissue or kernel/seed/grain). This phenomenon is referred to as gene stacking. In the USA this type of hybrid GMO is not regulated if both parent GMOs are authorised. In Europe, however, the hybrid is treated as a new GMO and requires separate authorisation. Not only does this create a problem with respect to identification, but it also creates a potential problem for quantitation. If a gene-stacked GM maize is authorised, then 0.6% gene-stacked hybrid shall be treated as a 0.6% GM maize according to EU legislation [7], but PCR tests would report 0.6% GM maize\u00a0A\u00a0+\u00a00.6% GM maize\u00a0B, that is 1.2% GM maize altogether. Reference targets: species or taxon specificFor quantitation, the copy number of the GM PCR target relative to genome copies of the corresponding species is important because the principle of quantitation of GM content is to compare the relative ratio of these two. Usually, a PCR targeting a species-specific single copy gene is used to determine the amount of the species derived DNA, for example the soybean lectin gene for soya-derived DNA. Thus, in addition to the four categories listed above, we also need PCR methods for the reference targets. In a diploid organism, each cell contains two copies of a single copy gene, while a tetraploid contains four copies per cell. If the GM-specific target is inserted in a single copy, then quantitation becomes relatively simple. In RoundupReady soybean the full-length gene construct is inserted in a single copy, and through backcrossing the diploid GMO has been made homozygous. Thus, in this case each GM cell has a 1:1 ratio of the GM target and the lectin gene. However, if the GM-specific target is inserted in several copies, quantitation becomes more uncertain, in particular if the exact number of inserted copies is unknown. Heterozygosity and ploidy level can introduce additional uncertainty, and testing on single plants, tissues or kernels/seeds/grains may be required to control these parameters. PCR-based quantitationQuantitation must be relative to something. In European legislation [7] it is relative to the ingredient (e.g. maize flour) usually interpreted on a weight basis, but in principle it could also be relative to a specified amount (volume or weight) of a matrix (e.g. beer or bread), or number of units (particles, DNA or protein molecules, etc.). Unfortunately, there is no exact relationship between weight or number of grains and DNA molecules. Yet, it is generally agreed that the best estimates we can obtain with analytical methods build on the assumption that the number of DNA molecules obtained from one weight unit or grain is the same, independent of GM or non-GM origin. Berdal and Holst\u2013Jensen [8] used a well-characterised food matrix produced with 10% w/w GM soybeans, and yet consistently estimated the GM content to be approximately 12% based on DNA ratios. This could be due to different DNA content per weight unit of the raw materials used for production of the food matrix (GM relative to non-GM soybeans). Because the analytical uncertainty of quantitative PCR methods is generally assumed to be around 25% for the best PCR methods available [9], it has been difficult to estimate the uncertainty introduced by variation between different cultivars, harvests and grains. Competitive PCRThe first quantitative PCR tests were based on competitive PCR [10, 11, 12] (Fig.\u00a03, Table\u00a02). Quantitation is done by comparison of the amount of end product (end-point quantitation), that is when the PCR reaction is completed. Two target sequences with very similar features and amplifiability are co-amplified in a single reaction tube. Because the two targets compete for available nucleotides, primers and DNA polymerases, the relative quantity of end product is assumed to correspond to the relative quantity at the beginning of the first PCR cycle. Competitive PCR requires development of suitable competitor molecules, and is highly sensitive to the starting concentrations and dilution of template DNAs. It involves massive pipetting of amplified DNA and visualisation by agarose gel electrophoresis, associated with a significant risk of cross contamination. Therefore, it is gradually being replaced with more sophisticated alternatives, in particular real-time PCR.Fig.\u00a03. Double competitive PCR. Drawing of agarose gel, with GM-specific amplifications (G1\u2013G6) on the left and reference (plant species)-specific amplifications (P1\u2013P6) on the right. A molecular size marker (M) is included on either side and between the series. For each of the two targets, a series (e.g. fourfold) of dilutions, and a competitor molecule is made. The competitor should be as similar to the target, and at the same time distinguishable from target, as possible. The same quantity of competitor (e.g. 250\u00a0copies) is added to each dilution. Because competitor and target will compete for reagents, the initial copy number ratio is approximately maintained at the end point of the reaction. When the copy numbers of competitor and target are the same, both will yield the same quantity of amplification product, visible as bands of equal intensity (equilibrium). The points of equilibrium (GE and PE) for the series are visualised by white boxes. GE=(G3+G4)/2, while PE=P3. Usually, the P\u00a0series will have to be diluted (e.g. 10-fold) relative to the G\u00a0series, because the GMO content is much lower than 100%. The GM content can be calculated using the formula GE/PE multiplied by 100%. The present example corresponds to a GM content of 5%Table\u00a02.

Fig.\u00a04 and Table\u00a02). Fluorescence signal corresponding to increased amount of amplification product can be measured and visualised on a computer screen. Software can immediately convert the signal into quantitative estimates. This speeds up quantitation, and the risk of cross contamination is low. With the fastest available alternative quantitative results can be made available within approximately 30\u00a0min from the beginning of the first PCR cycle. In comparison, competitive PCR would require at least 3\u00a0h, usually more. Quantitation can either be done by direct comparison of the Ct-values of the two (\u0394Ct-method) or by comparison with a standard curve. The advantage of standard curve quantitation is that Ct-values are compared only with Ct-values of the same amplicon. So with standard curve quantitation, the final quantitative estimate is based on comparing estimated quantity of GM to estimated quantity of reference. The estimate is therefore the ratio of quantity to quantity, not of PCR cycle to PCR cycle. Real-time PCR requires very expensive laboratory equipment, and therefore cheaper alternatives giving similar accuracy and comparable throughput are welcomed.Fig.\u00a04. Real-time PCR. Each amplification reaction is shown as a separate coloured graph. The fluorescence released in response to synthesis of the target amplicon is measured in real-time. The increase in amplification products in the initial PCR cycles is too small to be detectable (dotted lines), but as the reaction proceeds it enters a phase where the increase can be visualised as a linear increase in signal (the log linear phase, shown as solid lines). When the signal corresponds to a threshold level (the baseline, green horizontal line), the corresponding cycle number for the reaction is scored (Ct-value). Quantitation can be done using a direct comparison of Ct-values (\u0394Ct method), or by comparison of copy numbers derived from a standard curve (standard curve method). For an unknown sample two reactions of the same concentration of the template DNA must be performed, one targeting a reference (R), and one targeting a GM-specific (G) sequence. The two reactions representing unknown sample shown in the figure are the black stippled graphs. The difference in Ct (\u0394Ct) for the two targets (\u0394Ct=CtG\u2212CtR) can be used directly to estimate the GM content using the formula \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${1 \\over {2^{\\Delta Ct} }} \\times 100\\%  = {\\rm GM}\\% $$ \\end{document}However, the use of \u0394 Ct for quantitation is only valid if the two targets are amplified with the same efficiency. The use of the standard curve method is not limited by such a requirement. With this method, a standard curve based on amplification of a series of reactions with known initial target copy number is established for each of the two targets. A regression line (the standard curve) relates initial target copy number to Ct-value, consequently allowing for conversion of the Ct-values of the unknown sample to initial target copy numbers. For simplicity, only one standard curve is shown in the figure, meant to represent the standard curves of both R and G. The GM content can be estimated by comparison of the initial target copy numbers of the two targets, using the formula \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{N_G } \\over {N_R }} \\times 100\\%  = {\\rm GM}\\% $$\\end{document} In the example shown, \u0394Ct=30.0\u221223.3=6.7, corresponding to approximately 1% GM. The same result is observed with the standard curve method, since NG=102 and NR=104Multiplex quantitationAlternatives to competitive PCR, yet building on end-point quantitation, include at least two ways of analysing populations of PCR reaction products from multiplex PCR developed within the European shared cost action Qpcrgmofood. Rudi and Holck [13] have developed a method where short oligonucleotide probes are labelled immediately after the PCR reaction, and where there is a linear relationship between the quantity of labelled probe and the quantity of the corresponding amplification product. The reactions are successively analysed by array hybridisation of the probes, and the identity of positives and quantitation is done by image analysis. Garcia\u2013Ca\u00f1as et al. [14] recently published a qualitative assay for duplex analysis and identification of the PCR reaction products from GMOs by capillary gel electrophoresis. Burns et al. [15] have recently developed a similar assay which is quantitative and includes three reaction products. Detection and quantification limitsThe limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) are defined as the lowest quantities that can be reliably detected and quantified, respectively. This may sound straightforward, but certainly is not. No subject, maybe apart from discussion on how to obtain suitable biological materials, has gained comparable attention or created more intense debate among experts on GMO analysis. Berdal and Holst\u2013Jensen [8] proposed to use absolute copy numbers of the target amplicons as the basis for establishing the LOD and LOQ, and to distinguish between the LOD/LOQ of the method (usually determined through a validation study as a relative value, e.g. 0.1%) and the practical LOD/LOQ (which can only be determined from results of analyses of the test sample). Purchasers of GMO tests are not a homogeneous group. Yet, they all expect the test reports to provide information about the analytical sample. Despite this fact, most certificates from test laboratories report the LOD and LOQ of the method, referring to relative percentage values from the method validation where DNA of high quality from a pure single taxon matrix is used. This situation is quite different from the situation with many analytical samples of commercial products. Such samples are often processed, may contain mixtures of (DNA from) several taxa, and the amount of high-quality DNA available in a PCR may be much lower than what is required if the reported (method specific) LOD and LOQ should be applicable. This is well known by the test laboratories, but because this knowledge requires insight in the technicalities of the analytical methods, it is less well known by competent authorities and companies purchasing the GMO tests. The practice clearly leads to misinterpretation, and could even be characterised as fraud, although a number of other factors to some extent may justify the practice. If the customer is unable to interpret a more correct test report referring to practical (sample specific) LOD/LOQ values, misinterpretation could still be the consequence, and stating that the LOD and LOQ are near or above the threshold for labelling might scare the customer from purchasing more tests from the test laboratory. The best solution to this challenge in our opinion would be a two-phased approach in which one 1) actively communicates to the competent authorities and other purchasers of GMO tests that there is a need for incorporation of test-specific LOD/LOQ values in test reports and legislation, and 2) tries to provide simple and interpretable expressions of the LOD/LOQ values in the test reports. Although this is a challenge, it is not an impossible thing to do. Determination of the practical LOD/LOQ must be DNA copy number based, but the values can be converted and expressed as relative percentages which we believe are easier to interpret relative to legislation. The LOD is the lowest concentration of the analyte at which the presence of the analyte will be detected with more than 95% probability. The LOD may therefore be determined by setting up a series of concentrations of the analyte and performing a statistically sufficient number of replicate analyses. This principle does not specify whether the analyte concentration is in DNA molecule copy numbers or relative percentages of DNA molecules. This freedom allows an LOD of five GM-DNA copies to be expressed very differently. Such an LOD may be applicable for a wide range of sample types. If it is expressed as LOD\u00a0=\u00a00.0001% (such a value may be reached under highly optimised conditions with five GM-DNA copies in a background of 5\u00d7106\u00a0haploid reference genomes of the corresponding species), then the expressed LOD would not be applicable with more complex or processed sample types (e.g. with 500\u00a0reference genomes mixed with a majority of DNA from other taxa). If, on the other hand, it is expressed as LOD\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0copies, then the LOD is not easily interpreted by non-experts. Furthermore, such a way of expressing the LOD is not harmonised with the legislation [7].If the genome size of the target taxon (e.g. soybean) is known and the DNA content in a pure DNA sample can be precisely determined, then a sample containing any relative percentage can be mixed by combining DNA from a non-GM plant specimen and a GM plant specimen, and the absolute copy numbers of the target taxon and GMO-specific sequences can be estimated reliably in these samples. Estimates of genome sizes are available [35], and quantitative methods frequently refer to these estimates. The estimates are sometimes given as ranges, in which case an analytical uncertainty is introduced if genome size is a parameter in the quantitation equation. Yet, genome sizes may prove very useful. Methods to determine the DNA content in a sample may yield considerable variation. One method that has been demonstrated to yield a high degree of correspondence between the estimated DNA content and PCR tests is based on SYBR Green fluorescence measurements [8]. No estimates of the measurement uncertainty of this method are currently available, but we find it reasonable to assume that it can be compared with the relative uncertainty introduced by mixing GM and non-GM materials in the preparation of CRMs on the basis of weight ratio. This would imply that in principle samples containing any concentration in absolute copy numbers or relative percentages of GMO relative to the target taxon can be prepared by mixing of DNA from a single GM specimen and a single non-GM specimen. The advantage of this should be obvious. It would allow determination of the full dynamic range of the method, it would allow a more precise determination of the LOD/LOQ of the method in absolute copy numbers, and it would allow the DNA-based method to be validated on the basis of DNA molecule ratios rather than on weight ratios. The latter would harmonise better with the basis for GM quantification with PCR.For the purpose of preparing samples as described above, DNA extracted from for example leaves of a single plant individual would be perfect. Such material can be obtained from a plant growing out of a single seed for example from a contaminated feed lot. Such seeds are not covered by patent protection, and thus property rights should not limit the access to biological material. Before the actual LOD and LOQ of a test can be estimated, it is important to take into consideration a few additional factors. The first factor is sampling. A single tomato is either GM or non-GM, while a corn cob may be composed of GM and non-GM kernels if the maternal DNA (the plant on which the cob is produced) is non-GM and some of the paternal DNA (from pollen) is GM. The number of units that can be GM must therefore be taken into consideration. In a sample of 10,000\u00a0tomatoes or maize kernels, a single GM tomato or kernel corresponds to 0.01%. Thus, the LOD cannot be less than 0.01% even if the tomatoes or kernels are converted to a pulp of billions of particles. If DNA is extracted from 106\u00a0particles then a single GM particle would correspond to 0.0001%. Thus, even if a single particle may contain many more haploid reference genomes, the LOD cannot be less than 0.0001%.The next aspect to consider is statistics, related to the distribution of units in a volume. This is often assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, giving a cumulative probability of drawing positives. However, distribution may be heterogeneous and aggregated. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether distribution is homogeneous and random throughout the analytical procedure, starting with sampling and terminating with the PCR. Estimating the LOD and LOQ for the PCR analysis alone is probably the simplest part of estimating the true LOD/LOQ of the final test, because we have good reason to assume that DNA is Poisson distributed in a liquid solution. The minimum copy number that can be detected is one. Thus, the theoretical absolute LOD (absLOD)\u22651\u00a0single copy. A Poisson distribution gives us a 95% probability of including at least one copy if the nominal number is 5\u00a0copies in the PCR [8, 36]. Thus, the real absLOD\u22655\u00a0copies for any target DNA in a single PCR. The relative LOD (relLOD in %) is determined by the ratio of the GM-specific absLOD (absLODGM) to observed haploid reference genomes in the PCR (REFOBSPCR). If the number of haploid reference genomes is maximized (REFMAXPCR), such as would typically be the case in a validation study, then the method-specific relLOD (relLODMETHOD) is determined: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${}^{{\\rm rel}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm METHOD}}  = {{{}^{{\\rm abs}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm GM}} } \\over {{}^{{\\rm REF}}{\\rm MAX}_{{\\rm PCR}} }} \\times 100\\% $$\n\\end{document}If the number of haploid reference genomes is the result of a specific observation for the unknown that is being tested, then the practical LOD of the sample (relLODSAMPLE) is determined: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${}^{{\\rm rel}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm SAMPLE}}  = {{{}^{{\\rm abs}}{\\rm LOD}_{{\\rm GM}} } \\over {{}^{{\\rm REF}}{\\rm OBS}_{{\\rm PCR}} }} \\times 100\\% $$\n\\end{document}Similar calculations can be performed for LOQ, which normally is between 5\u201310\u00a0times the LOD. Increasing the number of replicates can improve the relLOD and relLOQ, but only because it means an increase in REFOBSPCR. The true LOD/LOQ of the test is always the cumulative LOD/LOQ of all the analytical steps, and the most important limiting factor is the analytical step that yields the worst LOD/LOQ. A direct observation from the relationships outlined above is that the relLOQSAMPLE is >100% if the REFOBSPCR is less than the absLOQGM. This is indeed sometimes the case with highly processed materials. Method development in the Qpcrgmofood projectWithin the project \"Reliable, Standardised, Specific, Quantitative Detection of Genetically Modified Food\" funded by the European Commission under the Fifth Framework program (Qpcrgmofood; contract no.\u00a0QLK1-1999-01301) a number of real-time quantitative PCR methods have been developed and published [8, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] and several additional papers presenting new methods are in preparation. The project was partially initiated through discussions in a working group of the European Committee for Normalisation (CEN), where the need for development of new and more reliable methods was identified. One of the objectives of the project is to provide validated methods to CEN. The project is composed of 6\u00a0workpackages; DNA extraction, reference genes, characterisation of event-specific sequence motifs, detection and quantitation method development, method validation, and socio-economic studies in relation to traceability and GM detection methods. DNA extraction is important because the most limiting factor with respect to the LOD/LOQ of the PCR test is the quality and quantity of template DNA. Reference genes play a very important role in the context of quantitation. Yet, the Qpcrgmofood project is the first project where the copy number and allelic stability of the reference gene-specific PCR targets are assessed across a wide range of available cultivars of the corresponding taxon and against non-target taxa. This has made it possible to distinguish between reliable and unreliable reference genes and primers, and to develop primers for new genes and taxa. The first paper presenting these results has already been published [20] and additional papers are in preparation. Several of these genes are presently in the process of being validated in collaborative trials and will successively be proposed as standards for CEN/ISO. Characterisation of event-specific sequence motifs is required to obtain sequence information for development of event-specific methods. In addition this also provides better insight into the actual process of transformation and can be used to verify and update the genetic maps of GMOs (e.g. [37]).Validation of PCR methodsValidation of GMO detection and quantitation methods is not straightforward, because of problems connected to availability, type and quality of reference materials, principles of quantitation, expression of the LOD and LOQ, and applicability of LOD and LOQ on different types of samples. There are essentially three critical components in a validation study: the method, the test material, and the performance of the participants. Prior to validation in a collaborative trial the method must be optimised and prevalidated. This may include publication in a peer-reviewed journal, allowing other scientists and laboratories to evaluate and criticise the method. More important, however, may be the organisation of a prevalidation trial among a small number of independent laboratories, similar to a full-scale collaborative trial. The objective of the prevalidation study should be to confirm that the method is suitable for the full-scale collaborative trial, including determination of the among- and within-laboratory variation. In the Qpcrgmofood project, such trials are performed for every method, and to select among alternative methods where more than one alternative exists for the same purpose.The test material must be referable to a standardised commodity. For GMOs, analytical methods are usually validated with CRMs. However, CRMs are presently only available for two GMOs, and their suitability for validation of real-time quantitative PCR methods may be questioned. First of all, the PCR methods can only be used to quantify the GMO content on the basis of genome equivalents (relative ratios of DNA molecules), while the CRMs are produced on the basis of weight equivalents. Since the number of DNA molecules in one unit of GM may differ from that of non-GM, a significant error may be introduced at this point. Secondly, to assure that the CRMs are sufficiently homogeneous the material used in the production of CRMs is ground to minimise the particle size variation [38], but a consequence is that much of the DNA is degraded [29]. Thirdly, the CRMs are only available in low relative percentage concentrations (0\u20135%), but the dynamic range of a method may include the 100% level. Fourthly, CRMs are pure, single-ingredient matrices. Validation based solely on CRMs may therefore give the wrong impression of the LOD and in particular the LOQ, for example if the absLOQGM varies with the total amount of template DNA in the PCR. In a recent study [29] such alteration was demonstrated for an event-specific real-time quantitative method targeting Bt11 maize by addition of soybean DNA. Similar results have been observed in our laboratory with an event-specific method targeting RoundupReady soybean (RRS) [8, unpublished data]. In the preparation of validation studies within the Qpcrgmofood-project, we have been confronted with a few particularly difficult questions concerning the selection of suitable test materials, and the expression of LOD and LOQ in relative percentages versus DNA copy numbers. In the project, event-specific methods are developed on the basis of sequence data obtained from characterisation of biological materials that may or may not be of certified origin, depending on the GMO. Sequences obtained from for example contaminated seed or feed samples, may be questioned, even if a sequence contig is obtained that matches perfectly with the description of the GMO in public databases, for example Agbios [4]. As a consequence, the methods developed on the basis of sequence data may or may not be questioned, depending on the source of the sequence data. One solution that we have considered within the Qpcrgmofood project is to submit the sequence data and method to the company producing the GMO, accompanied by a request for biological material and/or verification of the sequence data. However, this will require collaboration by companies that hitherto have been restrictive in their distribution of materials and sequence data, and could lead to restrictions or delays in publication. Another solution could be to validate the method with the available material or cloned DNA fragments [33], stating the limitation of the validity of the results associated with the degree of uncertainty regarding the origin of the material. Whether it is acceptable from the standpoint of CEN or other standardising bodies is an important question. The conclusions at this point may have a strong impact on the number of GMOs for which methods can be made available and validated. Even if the sequence data are not questioned, the suitability of the test materials for testing the specificity may be questioned if they are derived from another source than the sequence data, for example if the sequence data is from a CRM, while the test material is produced from dried leaf material of a single plant specimen. We would argue that the specificity of the method is assured by design of the method to detect and quantify the event-specific integration junction using a highly specific hybridisation probe, for example a TaqMan probe. Consequently, we do not find such criticism against the use of non-certified material in a validation study justified, if the sequence data is not questioned. Final conclusionsThe major challenges in the field of PCR-based GM detection methods are the accessibility of GM-derived material, the DNA extraction methods, efficient cost reductions and multiplexing, and implementation of sample-specific expressions of the LOD and LOQ. Method availability and validation is heavily influenced by these challenges, as well as by available resources invested. The major achievements made within the last couple of years, in particular in the context of the Qpcrgmofood project include identification of reliable species-specific reference genes for particularly important crop plants, characterisation of transformation events, development of event-specific quantitative methods for several GMOs, as well as of multiplex methods, better understanding and expression of the LOD and LOQ in PCR tests for GMOs, and improved strategies for validation of GMO detection methods.

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nPolyaniline (PANI) is unique among conducting polymers in that its electrical properties could be reversibly controlled both by charge transfer doping and by protonation, which makes it a potential material for applications as chemical and biological sensors, actuators, microelectronic devices, etc. . However, the insolubility in common solvent, low processability and poor mechanical properties of PANI has obstructed its potential applications. In order to fulfill the industrial demand, several strategies have been developed to overcome such problems. For instance, the preparation of conventional thermoplastic\u2013electroconductive polymer composites is a successful approach to achieve unique properties and applications of the resultant materials . In recent years, the development of PANI/metal nanoparticle composite with synergistic chemical and physical properties has received great attention world wide from both academic and industrial point of view . The incorporation of metal nanoparticles could effectively improve the electrical, optical and dielectric properties of the polyaniline composites . These properties are very much sensitive to small changes in the metal content and in the size and shape of the nanoparticles. It was reported that the nanoparticles themselves could act as conductive junctions between the PANI chains that resulted in an increase of the electrical conductance of the composites . The electrical conductivity of such composites might also depend upon the molecular structure of the conductive polymer matrix (i.e., crystallinity). Since silver exhibits the highest electrical and thermal conductivities among all the metals , the combination of PANI with silver could yield functional materials having enhanced electrical properties.\nThe synthesis of PANI/silver composites was accomplished either chemically or electrochemically. The chemical methods include the polymerization of aniline monomer with simultaneous reduction of metal ions and the photo-induced polymerization , which are based on the high affinity of metal ions for PANI. The other methods are to prepare the PANI/Ag composites in the presence of Ag nanoparticles . Recently, gas sensors based on PANI nanocomposites combined with different noble metal catalysts have been the subjects of considerable interest. The reason for incorporating metallic particles into conductive polymer matrix is to increase the specific area of these materials and thus improve catalytic efficiency. It has been revealed that the chemically synthesized PANI/copper nanocomposite gas sensor exhibited higher response values, faster response and recovery rates to chloroform vapour than those of a pure PANI sensor fabricated under the identical conditions . Torsi et al. reported that the conducting polymers doped with metallic inclusions performed better than pure polymers and a possible catalytic process might occur in these sensors. Athawale et al. explored the possibility of using Pd/PANI nanocomposites as a sensing material for different aliphatic alcohols. They found that the response time and long-term stability of the nanocomposite sensor to methanol vapour were superior to those of a pure PANI sensor. Similarly, Do and Chang discussed the electrochemical characteristics and the sensing properties of amperometric NO2 gas sensors based on PANI/Au/Nafion. Therefore, it is hopeful to obtain PANI/Ag based novel materials with excellent gas-sensing behaviours. To the best of our knowledge the PANI/Ag nanocomposite was not found to be reported as ethanol sensing materials.\nIn the present investigation, I have chemically synthesized PANI/Ag nanocomposites with different Ag concentrations. The morphological and electrical characterizations of the PANI/Ag nanocomposites were discussed. The sensing behaviour of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites towards ethanol vapour were investigated.\nAniline monomer, silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (USA) as analytical grade. Ammonium peroxodisulphate ((NH4)2S2O8), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol were bought from Merck India Ltd. as reagent grade.\nNanosized silver particles were synthesized by chemical reduction of AgNO3 using NaBH4 (molar ratio of AgNO3 to NaBH4 equal to 1:2) in the deionized (DI) water. Silver nitrate solution was separately prepared by adding different mole percentages, viz., 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mol%, of AgNO3 in DI water. The aqueous solution of NaBH4 was slowly added to the above AgNO3 solution (200 ml) under constant stirring and the reduction reaction continued for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, yellowish-red colloid of silver nanoparticles was obtained. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that the average diameters of the Ag(0) particles were \u223c3 and \u223c5 nm, respectively.\nThe PANI/Ag nanocomposite was prepared by in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline monomer in the presence of silver nanoparticles colloid. In a typical synthesis process, aniline-hydrochloride (2.59 g, 20 mmol) was added to the previously prepared Ag nanoparticles colloid (200 ml), followed by addition of the aqueous solution of (NH4)2S2O8 (5.71 g, 25 mmol). The mixture was allowed to react for 12 h under constant stirring at 1\u20132 \u00b0C. The resultant product was filtered and washed with DI water and acetone till the filtrated became colorless and then dried in vacuum for overnight. The pure PANI was synthesized using same chemical polymerization method as described above in the absence of silver colloid.\nFor UV\u2013vis spectroscopic analysis, the pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite samples (in powder form) were dispersed in ethanol. The absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer with a spectral resolution of 2 nm.\nThe morphologies of synthesized PANI/Ag nanocomposites were observed with a JEOL JSM2000-EX II transmission electron microscopy at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dropping the PANI/Ag suspension (in acetone) on the carbon coated copper grids. The elemental compositions of the pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites were estimated by energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) (Inca Energy, Oxford Instruments Microanalysis Ltd.).\nTo measure the AC conductivity and dielectric properties, samples were prepared as 1.0 cm diameter pellets by pressing the powder under a hydraulic pressure of 5 t and then applying conducting silver paste to form the electrodes in contact with the two circular faces. The sample was then held between two spring loaded copper plates. The measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 103\u2013106 Hz at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) using ALPHA-ATB high resolution Dielectric Analyzer (Germany).\nThe gas sensitivity of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite sensors (as pellets) were studied under the continuous flow of ethanol\u2013air mixture at room temperature under the relative humidity of 62 \u00b1 3%. The sensing measurements were performed at different ethanol vapour concentrations, viz., 100, 300 and 500 ppm. The ethanol\u2013air mixture was flown from the headspace of a bottle containing ethanol. The DC electric resistance of the samples exposed to analyte vapour was determined using a two-probe configuration. The electrical contacts were made on the pellet surface by copper wires and silver paste with 2 mm distance between the probes. The change in resistance of the samples against constant current (1.0 \u03bcA) and voltage (2.1 V) was measured by passing ethanol vapour with carrier gas (air) through the glass chamber at a fixed flow rate. The resistance was measured as a function of time on a digital multimeter (Keithley model 196).\nFT-IR spectra of the nanocomposites were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 spectrophotometer within the wavenumber range of 2000\u2013400 cm\u22121. The sample was prepared in the pellet form by mixing the material with KBr (Aldrich, 99%, FT-IR grade). The FT-IR spectra of the exposed samples were obtained by subjecting the pellets to different concentrations of ethanol in the sample port.\nUV\u2013vis absorption spectra of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites are demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The absorption spectra of pure PANI showed two characteristic peaks at \u223c342 and \u223c624 nm, which are associated with \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* and n\u2013\u03c0* transitions, respectively . Similar absorption bands with a little red shift appeared in the UV\u2013vis spectra of PANI/Ag nanocomposites (Fig. 1). This red shift is caused by the strong interaction between polyaniline and silver. In contrast to pure PANI, the PANI/Ag nanocomposites exhibit a sharp peak between 400 and 425 nm (Fig. 1). This peak is assigned to surface plasmon resonance absorption of the electrons in the conducting silver bands . When a dielectric polymer\u2013metal nanocomposite is excited by light, photons are coupled at the dielectric polymer\u2013metal interface, causing an induced charge density oscillation that creates a strong absorption peak at a particular wavelength. It can be seen that with increase in Ag concentration the absorption maximum shifts towards longer wavelengths, which could be attributed to the spill-out of the s-electrons or due to increase of the effective mass of the conduction electrons . The increase in the absorbance of nanocomposite at \u223c630 nm with increasing Ag concentration (Fig. 1) could be attributed to the scattering effects of the aggregated Ag particles present in the PANI matrix and the additional polaronic bands created due to metal nanoparticles. However, the overall results clearly implying the formation of PANI/Ag nanocomposite.\nFig. 2a and b shows the TEM images for the PANI/Ag-0.5 mol% and the PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposites, respectively. The particle size histograms of these nanocomposite samples are presented in Fig. 2. As shown in TEM images (Fig. 2), the silver particles (black spots) are well adhered on the PANI substrate due to strong affinity of silver for nitrogen. It can also be seen that the spherically shaped Ag nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the PANI matrix. The particles are not clearly monodispersed. The degree of size dispersity of Ag nanoparticles increased with increasing Ag concentration in the nanocomposite. The silver particles with average diameters of \u223c8 and \u223c14 nm are observed on the TEM images for the PANI/Ag-0.5 mol% and the PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposites, respectively. The formation of relatively large particles with higher size dispersity in the case of PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposite could be attributed to the silver migration and aggregation. The migration and aggregation of silver particles might be driven by the instability of silver atoms due to their high surface free energy. Their aggregation would produce thermodynamically stable clusters . Table 1 presents the elemental compositions of synthesized PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites as obtained from EDX analysis. EDX analysis shows the presence of silver in the prepared nanocomposite. The silver content (atom%) on the composite surface increased with increasing Ag concentration. The combined information from TEM and EDX favour the genuine nanocomposite formation with PANI and Ag nanoparticles.\nTo illustrate the effect of Ag nanoparticles on the AC conductivity and dielectric properties of polyaniline materials, a comparison of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite was made. Fig. 3 demonstrates the variation of AC conductivity, dielectric constant and dielectric loss with frequency for pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 3a, the AC conductivity (at 1.0 MHz) of the PANI/Ag nanocomposite is recorded in the range of 1.12\u20131.83 \u00d7 10\u22122 S cm\u22121, which is significantly higher than that of the pure PANI (10\u22124 S cm\u22121). The lower conductivity for the pure PANI could be ascribed to low level of protonation of the PANI chains. The improvement of AC conductivity for PANI/Ag nanocomposites comes from the effective dispersion of Ag nanoparticles in the PANI matrix (shown in TEM images), which favours better electronic transport. It can be seen that the conductivity of PANI/Ag nanocomposites increases as the frequency increases, with a higher slope at the higher frequency region (>10 kHz). The frequency dependence of the AC conductivity is considered to be a result of interface charge polarization (or Maxwell\u2013Wagner\u2013Sillars effect) and intrinsic electric dipole polarization . This phenomenon appears in heterogeneous system like metal\u2013polymer composites due to the accumulation of mobile charges at the interfaces and the formation of large dipoles on metal particles or clusters. The concentration of the metal particles influences polarization as well as AC conduction inside the composite system. Moreover, the conductivity of nanocomposites increases as the Ag concentration increases from 0.5 to 2.5 mol% (Fig. 3a). The increasing tendency of conductivity could be due to decreasing inter-particles distance between Ag\u2013Ag particles with increasing Ag concentration in the composites, as seen in the TEM images (Fig. 2).\nFig. 3b and c shows the effects of Ag nanoparticles on the dielectric constants and dielectric losses of polyaniline in the frequency range of 103\u2013106 Hz. In Fig. 3b and c, higher dielectric constants and losses of PANI/Ag nanocomposites than those of pure PANI are observed. It can be seen that the incorporation of 2.5 mol% Ag enhanced the dielectric constant of the PANI/Ag nanocomposite up to 5.8 at 1.0 kHz, which is about 3.5 times of that recorded for the pure PANI (1.9 at 1.0 kHz) under the same conditions. At the same time, there is about a four orders of magnitude increase in dielectric loss upon incorporation of 2.5 mol% Ag in the polyaniline. From the results described above, it has been considered that the enhanced dielectric constants and losses might originate from the increased conductivity. In the case of PANI/Ag nanocomposites, the dielectric constant increased with increasing Ag concentration from 0.5 to 2.5 mol% (Fig. 3b). This is due to increasing dispersed particles size with increasing Ag concentration in the composites , as shown in TEM images. The better dielectric constant of the PANI/Ag nanocomposites indicates their better ability to store electric potential energy under the influence of alternative electric field. The frequency dependency of dielectric constant is found to be increased with increasing Ag concentration in the composite (Fig. 3b). This is thought to be a result of the slow dielectric relaxation of the PANI matrix and the interface of the composite.\nSince the absorption of organic vapour molecules affects the electrical conduction properties of the nanoparticles-surrounding medium, the change in electrical conductivity or resistance could be correlated to the concentration of absorbed vapour. In the present study, the sensing capability of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite sensors towards different concentrations (100, 300, 500 ppm) of ethanol vapour has been explored. Fig. 4 shows the electrical responses of each sensor to 100, 300 and 500 ppm of ethanol at room temperature. The responses of the sensor pellets are presented in terms of R/R 0, where R and R 0 denote the resistance of the sensor measured in presence of ethanol and air, respectively. As seen for pure PANI sensor, the R/R 0 value gradually increases upon exposure to ethanol vapour but fails to return to the baseline value (initial response value) after being transferred to dry air (Fig. 4), indicating a poor reversibility to ethanol. The increase in resistance of the sensor on exposure to ethanol is thought to be caused by an interaction via H-bonding between the \u2013OH groups of ethanol molecules and the nitrogen atoms of PANI, leading to the hindrance in conformational rearrangements of the macromolecules that impedes electron delocalization and charge transport through the polymer chain. In contrast to pure PANI sensor, the responses of PANI/Ag sensors show more stability as well as good reproducibility to ethanol vapour under same conditions. Moreover, the nanocomposite sensors exhibit high resolution of dynamic response curves compared to that observed for pure PANI sensor (Fig. 4). The ethanol vapour-sensing ability of the nanocomposite sensor is significantly enhanced with increasing Ag concentration in the nanocomposite (Fig. 4). The improved response in the presence of Ag nanoparticles could be attributed to the higher vapours permeability of the nanocomposite, induced by an increase in the free volume of the polymer. Fig. 5 shows the response of PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% sensor for the repeated exposure and removal of 500 ppm ethanol up to three cycles. As shown in Fig. 5, the nanocomposite sensor exhibited high reproducibility and reversibility upon repeated exposure and removal of ethanol, indicating its long-term stability to ethanol vapour. This indicates that the presence of Ag nanoparticles has a catalytic influence in the adsorption\u2013desorption process, contributing to the stable response of the nanocomposite sensor to analyte vapour.\nThe response time, i.e., the time required to reach 90% total resistance change, of the prepared sensors exposed to ethanol of various concentrations was determined, and the results are depicted in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of Ag nanoparticles significantly reduced the response time of PANI sensor at any level of ethanol concentration. It can be seen that the response time is dependent on the Ag concentration in the PANI/Ag sensors. The response time (at 100\u2013500 ppm ethanol) of pure PANI sensor is recorded within 260\u2013218 s, which is decreased to 160\u201394, 140\u201385 and 102\u201352 s for the PANI/Ag sensor containing 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mol% Ag, respectively. This clearly indicates that the PANI/Ag sensor is more sensitive to ethanol vapour than the pure PANI sensor. The distinct sensitivity to ethanol under identical experimental conditions is attributed to the different degree of interactions between the absorbed ethanol molecules and the different sensors. Moreover, the exposure to higher concentration of ethanol effectively promoted the rate of vapour absorption on sensor pellets and thus, decreased the response time (Fig. 6). It is found that the response times are always much lower than the recovery times for each sensor samples. This is due to the strong polar affinity between the analyte molecules and the PANI chains, which slows down the desorption of the former. As a matter of fact, the analyte molecules could develop local interactions with PANI matrix via hydrogen bonding. However, these interactions are very weak so that the complete reversibility of the process is assured.\nFig. 7 presents the variation of response (R/R 0) with ethanol concentration for the pure PANI and PANI/Ag sensors. As shown in Fig. 7, all of the studied sensors responded linearly to increased ethanol concentration, having different correlation coefficient (R 2) values. In contrast to pure PANI sensor, the PANI/Ag sensors showed better correlationship between the sensor response and the ethanol concentration, as could be deduced from the higher R 2 values. The ethanol vapour-sensing response of the nanocomposite sensors, as estimated from the slope of the linear plot of response versus ethanol concentration (Fig. 7), is found to be higher than that of the pure PANI sensor. The highest slope of the PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% sensor (0.002 ppm\u22121) indicates its maximum sensing ability to ethanol. Sensor response also increases linearly with increasing Ag concentration as indicated in Fig. 8 .\nTo visualize induced structural modifications on exposure to ethanol vapour, FT-IR analysis was conducted at wavenumber region of 2000\u2013400 cm\u22121. Fig. 9 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of the unexposed PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposite (Fig. 9a) and that of the nanocomposite on exposure to two extreme concentrations of ethanol, viz., 100 and 500 ppm (Fig. 9b and c). The absorption peaks at 1597 and 1489 cm\u22121 are assigned to the C N stretching of the quinoid and the C C stretching of the benzenoid rings, respectively . The characteristic bands at 1335 and 1166 cm\u22121 represent the C\u2013N stretching of benzenoid structure and the in-plane C\u2013H bending of quinoid structure, respectively . The band at 817 cm\u22121 is identified with the out-of-plane bending of C\u2013H bond in the aromatic ring. It can be observed that the intensity as well as sharpness of the absorption bands are significantly increased on exposure to ethanol vapour (the effect being more prominent at higher concentration of ethanol, i.e., 500 ppm), indicating positive interactions between the ethanol molecules and the PANI chains. Moreover, the quinoid peaks are found to be shifted by 36 cm\u22121 (from 1597 to 1561 cm\u22121) and 53 cm\u22121 (from 1597 to 1544 cm\u22121) on exposure to 100 and 500 ppm ethanol, respectively. The shift towards lower wavenumber indicates a decrease in the conjugation length as a result of the formation of H-bonding between the \u2013OH group of ethanol and both the amine and imine group of PANI.\nThe PANI/Ag nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by in-situ chemical polymerization approach at different Ag concentrations. The formation of Ag nanoparticles and its existence in the prepared nanocomposites was confirmed by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy and EDX analysis. TEM analysis shows uniform dispersion of the spherically shaped Ag nanoparticles in the PANI matrix. The PANI/Ag nanocomposites exhibit remarkable improvement of electrical conductivity and dielectric properties when compared with pure PANI. The AC conductivity of PANI/Ag nanocomposites was increased by two orders of magnitude with respect to pure PANI. In contrast to pure PANI sensor, the PANI/Ag based sensor responded rapidly and reversibly in the presence of ethanol. However, the sensing characteristics such as sensor response, response time, and reproducibility are found to be dependent on the Ag concentration in the sensor. The highest sensing capability along with better long-term stability was observed for the sensor containing 2.5 mol% Ag. In the case of nanocomposite sensors, the sensor response exhibited a good linear relationship with ethanol concentration as well as with Ag concentration. This work demonstrates the potential application of the PANI/Ag nanocomposite as a selective ethanol sensor.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

However, the insolubility in common solvent, low processability and poor mechanical properties of PANI has obstructed its potential applications. In order to fulfill the industrial demand, several strategies have been developed to overcome such problems. For instance, the preparation of conventional thermoplastic\u2013electroconductive polymer composites is a successful approach to achieve unique properties and applications of the resultant materials . In recent years, the development of PANI/metal nanoparticle composite with synergistic chemical and physical properties has received great attention world wide from both academic and industrial point of view . The incorporation of metal nanoparticles could effectively improve the electrical, optical and dielectric properties of the polyaniline composites . These properties are very much sensitive to small changes in the metal content and in the size and shape of the nanoparticles. It was reported that the nanoparticles themselves could act as conductive junctions between the PANI chains that resulted in an increase of the electrical conductance of the composites . The electrical conductivity of such composites might also depend upon the molecular structure of the conductive polymer matrix (i.e., crystallinity). Since silver exhibits the highest electrical and thermal conductivities among all the metals , the combination of PANI with silver could yield functional materials having enhanced electrical properties.\nThe synthesis of PANI/silver composites was accomplished either chemically or electrochemically. The chemical methods include the polymerization of aniline monomer with simultaneous reduction of metal ions and the photo-induced polymerization , which are based on the high affinity of metal ions for PANI. The other methods are to prepare the PANI/Ag composites in the presence of Ag nanoparticles . Recently, gas sensors based on PANI nanocomposites combined with different noble metal catalysts have been the subjects of considerable interest. The reason for incorporating metallic particles into conductive polymer matrix is to increase the specific area of these materials and thus improve catalytic efficiency. It has been revealed that the chemically synthesized PANI/copper nanocomposite gas sensor exhibited higher response values, faster response and recovery rates to chloroform vapour than those of a pure PANI sensor fabricated under the identical conditions . Torsi et al. reported that the conducting polymers doped with metallic inclusions performed better than pure polymers and a possible catalytic process might occur in these sensors. Athawale et al. explored the possibility of using Pd/PANI nanocomposites as a sensing material for different aliphatic alcohols. They found that the response time and long-term stability of the nanocomposite sensor to methanol vapour were superior to those of a pure PANI sensor. Similarly, Do and Chang discussed the electrochemical characteristics and the sensing properties of amperometric NO2 gas sensors based on PANI/Au/Nafion. Therefore, it is hopeful to obtain PANI/Ag based novel materials with excellent gas-sensing behaviours. To the best of our knowledge the PANI/Ag nanocomposite was not found to be reported as ethanol sensing materials.\nIn the present investigation, I have chemically synthesized PANI/Ag nanocomposites with different Ag concentrations. The morphological and electrical characterizations of the PANI/Ag nanocomposites were discussed. The sensing behaviour of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites towards ethanol vapour were investigated.\nAniline monomer, silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (USA) as analytical grade. Ammonium peroxodisulphate ((NH4)2S2O8), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol were bought from Merck India Ltd. as reagent grade.\nNanosized silver particles were synthesized by chemical reduction of AgNO3 using NaBH4 (molar ratio of AgNO3 to NaBH4 equal to 1:2) in the deionized (DI) water. Silver nitrate solution was separately prepared by adding different mole percentages, viz., 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mol%, of AgNO3 in DI water. The aqueous solution of NaBH4 was slowly added to the above AgNO3 solution (200 ml) under constant stirring and the reduction reaction continued for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, yellowish-red colloid of silver nanoparticles was obtained. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that the average diameters of the Ag(0) particles were \u223c3 and \u223c5 nm, respectively.\nThe PANI/Ag nanocomposite was prepared by in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline monomer in the presence of silver nanoparticles colloid. In a typical synthesis process, aniline-hydrochloride (2.59 g, 20 mmol) was added to the previously prepared Ag nanoparticles colloid (200 ml), followed by addition of the aqueous solution of (NH4)2S2O8 (5.71 g, 25 mmol). The mixture was allowed to react for 12 h under constant stirring at 1\u20132 \u00b0C. The resultant product was filtered and washed with DI water and acetone till the filtrated became colorless and then dried in vacuum for overnight. The pure PANI was synthesized using same chemical polymerization method as described above in the absence of silver colloid.\nFor UV\u2013vis spectroscopic analysis, the pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite samples (in powder form) were dispersed in ethanol. The absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer with a spectral resolution of 2 nm.\nThe morphologies of synthesized PANI/Ag nanocomposites were observed with a JEOL JSM2000-EX II transmission electron microscopy at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dropping the PANI/Ag suspension (in acetone) on the carbon coated copper grids. The elemental compositions of the pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites were estimated by energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) (Inca Energy, Oxford Instruments Microanalysis Ltd.).\nTo measure the AC conductivity and dielectric properties, samples were prepared as 1.0 cm diameter pellets by pressing the powder under a hydraulic pressure of 5 t and then applying conducting silver paste to form the electrodes in contact with the two circular faces. The sample was then held between two spring loaded copper plates. The measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 103\u2013106 Hz at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) using ALPHA-ATB high resolution Dielectric Analyzer (Germany).\nThe gas sensitivity of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite sensors (as pellets) were studied under the continuous flow of ethanol\u2013air mixture at room temperature under the relative humidity of 62 \u00b1 3%. The sensing measurements were performed at different ethanol vapour concentrations, viz., 100, 300 and 500 ppm. The ethanol\u2013air mixture was flown from the headspace of a bottle containing ethanol. The DC electric resistance of the samples exposed to analyte vapour was determined using a two-probe configuration. The electrical contacts were made on the pellet surface by copper wires and silver paste with 2 mm distance between the probes. The change in resistance of the samples against constant current (1.0 \u03bcA) and voltage (2.1 V) was measured by passing ethanol vapour with carrier gas (air) through the glass chamber at a fixed flow rate. The resistance was measured as a function of time on a digital multimeter (Keithley model 196).\nFT-IR spectra of the nanocomposites were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 spectrophotometer within the wavenumber range of 2000\u2013400 cm\u22121. The sample was prepared in the pellet form by mixing the material with KBr (Aldrich, 99%, FT-IR grade). The FT-IR spectra of the exposed samples were obtained by subjecting the pellets to different concentrations of ethanol in the sample port.\nUV\u2013vis absorption spectra of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites are demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The absorption spectra of pure PANI showed two characteristic peaks at \u223c342 and \u223c624 nm, which are associated with \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* and n\u2013\u03c0* transitions, respectively . Similar absorption bands with a little red shift appeared in the UV\u2013vis spectra of PANI/Ag nanocomposites (Fig. 1). This red shift is caused by the strong interaction between polyaniline and silver. In contrast to pure PANI, the PANI/Ag nanocomposites exhibit a sharp peak between 400 and 425 nm (Fig. 1). This peak is assigned to surface plasmon resonance absorption of the electrons in the conducting silver bands . When a dielectric polymer\u2013metal nanocomposite is excited by light, photons are coupled at the dielectric polymer\u2013metal interface, causing an induced charge density oscillation that creates a strong absorption peak at a particular wavelength. It can be seen that with increase in Ag concentration the absorption maximum shifts towards longer wavelengths, which could be attributed to the spill-out of the s-electrons or due to increase of the effective mass of the conduction electrons . The increase in the absorbance of nanocomposite at \u223c630 nm with increasing Ag concentration (Fig. 1) could be attributed to the scattering effects of the aggregated Ag particles present in the PANI matrix and the additional polaronic bands created due to metal nanoparticles. However, the overall results clearly implying the formation of PANI/Ag nanocomposite.\nFig. 2a and b shows the TEM images for the PANI/Ag-0.5 mol% and the PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposites, respectively. The particle size histograms of these nanocomposite samples are presented in Fig. 2. As shown in TEM images (Fig. 2), the silver particles (black spots) are well adhered on the PANI substrate due to strong affinity of silver for nitrogen. It can also be seen that the spherically shaped Ag nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the PANI matrix. The particles are not clearly monodispersed. The degree of size dispersity of Ag nanoparticles increased with increasing Ag concentration in the nanocomposite. The silver particles with average diameters of \u223c8 and \u223c14 nm are observed on the TEM images for the PANI/Ag-0.5 mol% and the PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposites, respectively. The formation of relatively large particles with higher size dispersity in the case of PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposite could be attributed to the silver migration and aggregation. The migration and aggregation of silver particles might be driven by the instability of silver atoms due to their high surface free energy. Their aggregation would produce thermodynamically stable clusters . Table 1 presents the elemental compositions of synthesized PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites as obtained from EDX analysis. EDX analysis shows the presence of silver in the prepared nanocomposite. The silver content (atom%) on the composite surface increased with increasing Ag concentration. The combined information from TEM and EDX favour the genuine nanocomposite formation with PANI and Ag nanoparticles.\nTo illustrate the effect of Ag nanoparticles on the AC conductivity and dielectric properties of polyaniline materials, a comparison of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite was made. Fig. 3 demonstrates the variation of AC conductivity, dielectric constant and dielectric loss with frequency for pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 3a, the AC conductivity (at 1.0 MHz) of the PANI/Ag nanocomposite is recorded in the range of 1.12\u20131.83 \u00d7 10\u22122 S cm\u22121, which is significantly higher than that of the pure PANI (10\u22124 S cm\u22121). The lower conductivity for the pure PANI could be ascribed to low level of protonation of the PANI chains. The improvement of AC conductivity for PANI/Ag nanocomposites comes from the effective dispersion of Ag nanoparticles in the PANI matrix (shown in TEM images), which favours better electronic transport. It can be seen that the conductivity of PANI/Ag nanocomposites increases as the frequency increases, with a higher slope at the higher frequency region (>10 kHz). The frequency dependence of the AC conductivity is considered to be a result of interface charge polarization (or Maxwell\u2013Wagner\u2013Sillars effect) and intrinsic electric dipole polarization . This phenomenon appears in heterogeneous system like metal\u2013polymer composites due to the accumulation of mobile charges at the interfaces and the formation of large dipoles on metal particles or clusters. The concentration of the metal particles influences polarization as well as AC conduction inside the composite system. Moreover, the conductivity of nanocomposites increases as the Ag concentration increases from 0.5 to 2.5 mol% (Fig. 3a). The increasing tendency of conductivity could be due to decreasing inter-particles distance between Ag\u2013Ag particles with increasing Ag concentration in the composites, as seen in the TEM images (Fig. 2).\nFig. 3b and c shows the effects of Ag nanoparticles on the dielectric constants and dielectric losses of polyaniline in the frequency range of 103\u2013106 Hz. In Fig. 3b and c, higher dielectric constants and losses of PANI/Ag nanocomposites than those of pure PANI are observed. It can be seen that the incorporation of 2.5 mol% Ag enhanced the dielectric constant of the PANI/Ag nanocomposite up to 5.8 at 1.0 kHz, which is about 3.5 times of that recorded for the pure PANI (1.9 at 1.0 kHz) under the same conditions. At the same time, there is about a four orders of magnitude increase in dielectric loss upon incorporation of 2.5 mol% Ag in the polyaniline. From the results described above, it has been considered that the enhanced dielectric constants and losses might originate from the increased conductivity. In the case of PANI/Ag nanocomposites, the dielectric constant increased with increasing Ag concentration from 0.5 to 2.5 mol% (Fig. 3b). This is due to increasing dispersed particles size with increasing Ag concentration in the composites , as shown in TEM images. The better dielectric constant of the PANI/Ag nanocomposites indicates their better ability to store electric potential energy under the influence of alternative electric field. The frequency dependency of dielectric constant is found to be increased with increasing Ag concentration in the composite (Fig. 3b). This is thought to be a result of the slow dielectric relaxation of the PANI matrix and the interface of the composite.\nSince the absorption of organic vapour molecules affects the electrical conduction properties of the nanoparticles-surrounding medium, the change in electrical conductivity or resistance could be correlated to the concentration of absorbed vapour. In the present study, the sensing capability of pure PANI and PANI/Ag nanocomposite sensors towards different concentrations (100, 300, 500 ppm) of ethanol vapour has been explored. Fig. 4 shows the electrical responses of each sensor to 100, 300 and 500 ppm of ethanol at room temperature. The responses of the sensor pellets are presented in terms of R/R 0, where R and R 0 denote the resistance of the sensor measured in presence of ethanol and air, respectively. As seen for pure PANI sensor, the R/R 0 value gradually increases upon exposure to ethanol vapour but fails to return to the baseline value (initial response value) after being transferred to dry air (Fig. 4), indicating a poor reversibility to ethanol. The increase in resistance of the sensor on exposure to ethanol is thought to be caused by an interaction via H-bonding between the \u2013OH groups of ethanol molecules and the nitrogen atoms of PANI, leading to the hindrance in conformational rearrangements of the macromolecules that impedes electron delocalization and charge transport through the polymer chain. In contrast to pure PANI sensor, the responses of PANI/Ag sensors show more stability as well as good reproducibility to ethanol vapour under same conditions. Moreover, the nanocomposite sensors exhibit high resolution of dynamic response curves compared to that observed for pure PANI sensor (Fig. 4). The ethanol vapour-sensing ability of the nanocomposite sensor is significantly enhanced with increasing Ag concentration in the nanocomposite (Fig. 4). The improved response in the presence of Ag nanoparticles could be attributed to the higher vapours permeability of the nanocomposite, induced by an increase in the free volume of the polymer. Fig. 5 shows the response of PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% sensor for the repeated exposure and removal of 500 ppm ethanol up to three cycles. As shown in Fig. 5, the nanocomposite sensor exhibited high reproducibility and reversibility upon repeated exposure and removal of ethanol, indicating its long-term stability to ethanol vapour. This indicates that the presence of Ag nanoparticles has a catalytic influence in the adsorption\u2013desorption process, contributing to the stable response of the nanocomposite sensor to analyte vapour.\nThe response time, i.e., the time required to reach 90% total resistance change, of the prepared sensors exposed to ethanol of various concentrations was determined, and the results are depicted in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of Ag nanoparticles significantly reduced the response time of PANI sensor at any level of ethanol concentration. It can be seen that the response time is dependent on the Ag concentration in the PANI/Ag sensors. The response time (at 100\u2013500 ppm ethanol) of pure PANI sensor is recorded within 260\u2013218 s, which is decreased to 160\u201394, 140\u201385 and 102\u201352 s for the PANI/Ag sensor containing 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mol% Ag, respectively. This clearly indicates that the PANI/Ag sensor is more sensitive to ethanol vapour than the pure PANI sensor. The distinct sensitivity to ethanol under identical experimental conditions is attributed to the different degree of interactions between the absorbed ethanol molecules and the different sensors. Moreover, the exposure to higher concentration of ethanol effectively promoted the rate of vapour absorption on sensor pellets and thus, decreased the response time (Fig. 6). It is found that the response times are always much lower than the recovery times for each sensor samples. This is due to the strong polar affinity between the analyte molecules and the PANI chains, which slows down the desorption of the former. As a matter of fact, the analyte molecules could develop local interactions with PANI matrix via hydrogen bonding. However, these interactions are very weak so that the complete reversibility of the process is assured.\nFig. 7 presents the variation of response (R/R 0) with ethanol concentration for the pure PANI and PANI/Ag sensors. As shown in Fig. 7, all of the studied sensors responded linearly to increased ethanol concentration, having different correlation coefficient (R 2) values. In contrast to pure PANI sensor, the PANI/Ag sensors showed better correlationship between the sensor response and the ethanol concentration, as could be deduced from the higher R 2 values. The ethanol vapour-sensing response of the nanocomposite sensors, as estimated from the slope of the linear plot of response versus ethanol concentration (Fig. 7), is found to be higher than that of the pure PANI sensor. The highest slope of the PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% sensor (0.002 ppm\u22121) indicates its maximum sensing ability to ethanol. Sensor response also increases linearly with increasing Ag concentration as indicated in Fig. 8 .\nTo visualize induced structural modifications on exposure to ethanol vapour, FT-IR analysis was conducted at wavenumber region of 2000\u2013400 cm\u22121. Fig. 9 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of the unexposed PANI/Ag-2.5 mol% nanocomposite (Fig. 9a) and that of the nanocomposite on exposure to two extreme concentrations of ethanol, viz., 100 and 500 ppm (Fig. 9b and c). The absorption peaks at 1597 and 1489 cm\u22121 are assigned to the C N stretching of the quinoid and the C C stretching of the benzenoid rings, respectively . The characteristic bands at 1335 and 1166 cm\u22121 represent the C\u2013N stretching of benzenoid structure and the in-plane C\u2013H bending of quinoid structure, respectively . The band at 817 cm\u22121 is identified with the out-of-plane bending of C\u2013H bond in the aromatic ring. It can be observed that the intensity as well as sharpness of the absorption bands are significantly increased on exposure to ethanol vapour (the effect being more prominent at higher concentration of ethanol, i.e., 500 ppm), indicating positive interactions between the ethanol molecules and the PANI chains. Moreover, the quinoid peaks are found to be shifted by 36 cm\u22121 (from 1597 to 1561 cm\u22121) and 53 cm\u22121 (from 1597 to 1544 cm\u22121) on exposure to 100 and 500 ppm ethanol, respectively. The shift towards lower wavenumber indicates a decrease in the conjugation length as a result of the formation of H-bonding between the \u2013OH group of ethanol and both the amine and imine group of PANI.\nThe PANI/Ag nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by in-situ chemical polymerization approach at different Ag concentrations. The formation of Ag nanoparticles and its existence in the prepared nanocomposites was confirmed by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy and EDX analysis. TEM analysis shows uniform dispersion of the spherically shaped Ag nanoparticles in the PANI matrix. The PANI/Ag nanocomposites exhibit remarkable improvement of electrical conductivity and dielectric properties when compared with pure PANI. The AC conductivity of PANI/Ag nanocomposites was increased by two orders of magnitude with respect to pure PANI. In contrast to pure PANI sensor, the PANI/Ag based sensor responded rapidly and reversibly in the presence of ethanol. However, the sensing characteristics such as sensor response, response time, and reproducibility are found to be dependent on the Ag concentration in the sensor. The highest sensing capability along with better long-term stability was observed for the sensor containing 2.5 mol% Ag. In the case of nanocomposite sensors, the sensor response exhibited a good linear relationship with ethanol concentration as well as with Ag concentration. This work demonstrates the potential application of the PANI/Ag nanocomposite as a selective ethanol sensor."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nRoom temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are liquid in a temperature range around or below room temperature. They are fused salts containing a heterocyclic cation, such as dialkylimidazoluim ion or N-alkylpyrindinium ion and an anion, such as halides, BF4 \u2212, PF6 \u2212, CF3SO3 \u2212, NTf2 or other complex anions. These RTILs have several unique properties, including minuscule vapor pressure, non-flammability and dual natural polarity, making them greatly applicable in many physical and chemical fields. Furthermore, the properties (hydrophobicity, viscosity, thermal stability, etc.) can be varied by the alternation of the substitutive group on the cation or the combined anion; these unique properties make RTILs a task-specific material. Due to the non-volatility and tunable solubility, RTILs can be used as an alternative media for synthesis/catalysis , extraction and electrochemistry . Some utilizations have been also demonstrated for various analytical purposes, such as the stationary phase for gas chromatography or liquid chromatography , matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) , the mobile phase modifier in HPLC and for liquid phase microextraction and hybrid liquid\u2013solid phase microextraction . Two recently reported reviews also have compiled the applications of RTILs in analytical chemistry .\nSolid phase microextraction (SPME) is a fairly new sampling and pre-concentration technique, which possesses solvent free, fast diffusion rate and high enrichment factor properties . These make SPME a rapid and highly sensitive sample pretreatment method. In addition, the SPME sampling can be carried out directly from the liquid samples or from the head space over liquid or solid phases. Since the sensitivity of SPME depends on the analyte partition between the extraction fiber and sample solution (or head space), so the interaction between the analyte and the fiber would have a great influence on the partition coefficient. Previous studies showed that RTILs can be used as an alternative solvent for solvent extraction and liquid phase microextraction, showing comparable or even better extraction efficiency than conventionally used solvents. Recently, RTILs have been combined with SPME technique. Due to their relative high viscosity and thermal stability, the RTILs can be coated on the surface of fused silica capillary tubing in place of regular SPME fiber. Jiang and co-workers demonstrated that [C8mim][PF6] can be physically absorbed on the surface of fused silica tubing or stainless steel wire. Good results were obtained for the analysis of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) in paint samples. However, because the extraction efficiency is dependent on the quantity of IL-coated on the SPME fiber, this efficiency is still limited by the relatively low absorption force, and so the RTIL layer on the fiber was thin. In order to overcome this, Nafion membrane was introduced in this study to increase the amount of IL that absorbed on the fiber.\nIn this study, five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene were used as target compounds. The PAHs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants arising from a variety of sources such as fossil fuel combustion, oil spills and some industrial processes. They are an important class of contaminants and possible human carcinogens. Since the solubility of PAH in water is very low, it is very important to develop a highly sensitive analytical method to detect them in natural water .\nThe aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, robust and low cost SPME method that can be used for the analysis of PAHs in water samples. The objectives were therefore to investigate the effects of the various experimental parameters on the extraction efficiency. The combination of IL and SPME has a number of advantages over other water extraction techniques such as liquid\u2013liquid extraction or solid phase extraction. Combining the sampling and pre-concentration processes into a single step can reduce the risk of contamination and analyte loss. In addition, less solvent is required, making the technique more environmentally benign.\nThe selected RTILs in this research (1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate: [C8mim][TfO]; 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate: [Bemim][TfO] and 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate: [Phpromim][TfO]) were ordered from Merck (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The structures and densities of the three ILs are tabulated in Table 1 . The PAHs standards were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Louis, MO). Nafion 117 (5% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) solution was purchased from Fluka (Fluka, Switzerland). All solvents were of absolve grade (Merck) and the ultra pure deionized water was obtain from Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA).\nThe gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analyses were performed with a Finnigan MAT GCQ (Finnigan Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), which is an ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with EI/CI ionization sources. The system is controlled by X\u2019calibur software. An Rtx-5MS capillary-fused silica column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness, Restek. Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used for GC separation. The injection port of the GC was kept at 240 \u00b0C and operated with splitless mode. The temperature program of the GC oven was operated initially at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by heating to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C min\u22121 and held for another 2 min. Ultra high purity (99.9995%) helium was used as carrier gas (flow rate: 1.18 mL min\u22121). The mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact ionization (EI) mode (70 eV, 200 \u00b0C). The mass spectra of target compounds were acquired and quantified in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The quantitation ion and confirmation ion for each analyte were first obtained by full scan mode and the base peak and confirmation ion of each PAH were selected. The selected ions are summarized in Table 2 . The glass sample vials used for extraction were 18 mL in volume and capped with aluminum cap and PTFE-coated septum. All glass vials used in this study were first washed with detergent, deionized water and solvents (methanol, acetone and hexane in sequence), then silanized with dichlorodimethylsilane (10% in toluene at room temperature). Finally, the vials were dried and wrapped with aluminum foil before use. The sample solution was controlled by an aluminum heating block while being extracted at operating temperature.\nA homemade SPME device was adopted for coating ionic liquid film on its fiber. Fig. 1 shows the design of the homemade SPME, which is modified from the prototype designed by Jiang and co-workers . Capillary-fused silica tubing (10 cm \u00d7 0.05 mm i.d., Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix AZ) was employed as the needle tip of the device. After removing the polyimide outer layer (approx. 3 cm in length) and sealing both ends of the tubing with a microflame torch, the capillary tubing was inserted into a stainless steel needle (2 in Fig. 1), which functions as the piercing needle. A PTFE-coated septum was placed into the hub (3 in Fig. 1) of the piercing needle for gas-tightening. A PEEK capillary fingertight fitting (VICI, Jour Research AB, Switzerland) (5 in Fig. 1) with a tubing sleeve (1/16 \u00d7 0.0155, Upchurch scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) (4 in Fig. 1) was utilized to tighten the capillary, leaving only 1.0 cm bare fused silica tubing sticking out of the piercing needle (1 in Fig. 1). The bare fused silica tip can be withdrawn into (when standing by or moving the device) or extruded out of (for sampling or desorption in the GC injector) the piercing needle by pulling backward or pushing forward the PEEK fitting.\nThe bare fused silica tip was conditioned by being extruded out of the piercing needle and rinsed with the following solvents: methanol, acetone, hexane and dichloromethane in sequence, then inserted in the GC injector (kept at 240 \u00b0C) for 5 min. After the conditioning process, the fused silica tip was immersed into the Nafion solution for 30 s. The Nafion solution was used directly at the purchased concentration. Then, the Nafion fiber was dried in the air for 3 min. The fiber was then immersed into the IL solution (IL + dichloromethane, 9 + 1, v+v) for 1 min and dried in the air for 3 min again. The ionic liquid SPME experiments were carried out by coating brand-new IL fiber for every extraction. After the GC\u2013MS analysis, the residue on the fiber was washed out with solvents and re-conditioned again as described above.\nIn this study, the sampling method of the SPME was carried out by head space (HS) mode. The sample extraction temperature, time and the salt effect were studied. For establishing calibration curves (standard solutions spiked in DI water) and analyzing natural water samples, 10 mL of each sample was dispensed into an 18 mL silanized glass vial that contained 2 g of NaCl and a Teflon-coated stirring bar. The stock solution of the five mixed PAHs was prepared in methanol (1 mg mL\u22121 each analyte), then sequentially diluted into each working solution (concentration range: 0.01\u201310 \u03bcg mL\u22121). The method detection limits for five tested PAHs were evaluated by decreasing the spiked concentration of working solution in each 10 mL DI water followed by IL\u2013SPME and GC\u2013MS detection, until the signal to noise ratio of each peak of PAHs on the chromatogram dropped to around three. The calibration curves were prepared by spiking 0.1\u201350 ng of working solutions into each 10 mL DI water, the spiked volumes were 1\u201310 \u03bcL (depending on the required concentration).\nTo evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, two natural water samples were analyzed. One was the rainwater collected at an industrial park, the other was the ground water collected on campus. The two samples were filtrated through a 0.22 \u03bcm PVDF membrane and stored at 4 \u00b0C before use. The sample volume was 10 mL for each extraction. For evaluation of the precision and repeatability of this proposed method, each natural water sample was extracted and analyzed (n = 3) on the same day; for reproducibility, the samples were determined on another day. Spiking recoveries were performed by spiking 10 \u03bcL standards into the sample solution at a concentration level of 50 pg mL\u22121 (10 mL sample volume) for all five PAHs. The results were calculated by linear regression calibration curve.\nDirect coating of the ionic liquid on the fiber of the SPME device was first introduced by Jiang co-workers . They demonstrated that [C8mim][PF6] can be physically absorbed on the surface of a stainless steel wire or fused silica tubing. The addition of a small amount of dichloromethane (IL + DCM, 9 + 1, v+v) can improve the coating ability of the RTILs on the surface of the bare fused silica and stainless steel wire. The dichloromethane evaporated quickly and leaving a thin RTIL film on the surface of the SPME fiber. Although the hybrid ionic liquid\u2013solid phase microextraction could be used to determine the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) in paint water samples, the sensitivity was low, because of the relatively low amount of the IL absorbed on the SPME fiber. In this study, Nafion membrane was selected to be the supported media to increase the amount of absorbed IL on the SPME fiber. Nafion is a cation exchange polymer, which possesses SO3 \u2212 functional group. It would enhance the quantity and stability of IL absorbed on the fiber surface through the electrostatic interaction between IL and the Nafion-supported membrane. Fig. 2 shows the optical microscopic photographs of IL coatings with and without a Nafion-supported membrane. It is obvious that the force of gravity would make the IL coating slowly agglomerate on the bare fused silica tip. This could cause unwanted contact of IL with the piercing needle when the fiber was being withdrawn back. On the other hand, the bare fused silica tip precoated with the Nafion-supported membrane produced a much more even film. It is obvious that with the presence of a Nafion membrane, the IL spread well on the fused silica tubing surface; it could eliminate interferences when the fiber was withdrawn back into the piercing needle. Therefore, Nafion membrane was being coated prior to the IL coating process. The comparison of extraction efficiency (by peak area) of the fiber coating with and without a Nafion membrane is shown in Fig. 3 . As can be seen, the peak areas which were obtained from the IL fiber coating with a Nafion-supported membrane are greater than those without it. A blank test was conducted by coating the bare fused silica tip with only the Nafion membrane to determine the five PAHs sample solution, and no significant absorption of the five PAHs was observed. In addition, in order to compare the amount of absorbed IL onto the fiber. The absorbed IL ([C8mim][TfO]) were leached and collected by acetonitrile (ACN), followed by flow injection analysis\u2013electrospray\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (FIA\u2013ESI\u2013MS/MS). Fig. 4 shows the comparison of intensities of [C8mim] cation between precoating with and without Nafion. The amount of absorbed [C8mim][TfO] by Nafion precoated fiber is greater than Nafion-uncoated one. Therefore, it can be confirmed that a Nafion membrane could increase the absorbed amount of IL as well as stabilize the IL film on the surface of the SPME fiber and enhance the extraction efficiency for PAHs.\nThe type of substituted groups on the imidazolium cation may affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME method. In this study, three ILs: [C8mim][TfO], [Bemim][TfO] and [Phpromim][TfO] were examined. Fig. 5 shows the peak areas of PAHs extracted by the Nafion/IL-coated fibers using these three ILs. It is obvious that [C8mim][TfO] has the greatest extraction efficiency for the five PAHs among all tested ILs. The extraction efficiencies were [C8mim][TfO] > [Bemim][TfO] > [Phpromim][TfO]. This might be related to the difference in diffusion rate of tested ILs. The five PAHs molecules in the head space diffused easier into [C8mim][TfO] than into the other two ILs. It is interesting that although the extraction efficiencies of [Bemim][TfO] and [Phpromim][TfO] were lower than [C8mim][TfO], the extraction efficiency for the five PAHs increased by increasing the number of aromatic rings (from naphthalene to fluoranthene, except pyrene went down a little). These results could be influenced by the solubility effect. [Bemim][TfO] and [Phpromim][TfO] both posses phenyl substitution group, which has stronger induced dipolar interaction, resulting in greater solubility for larger PAHs. However, there were also other factors such as volatility and diffusion rate effect, and pyrene was suppressed. For the best extraction efficiency, [C8mim][TfO] was adopted for the routine analyses.\nThe amount of analytes desorbed from the SPME fiber would greatly influence the intensity of the GC\u2013MS acquisitions. Since the tested five PAHs are semivolatile compounds, they need relatively high temperature to desorb from the fiber. However, the higher temperature may cause the ILs to decompose. It is thus very important to find the adequate desorption temperature and time that permits quick desorption of the five PAHs and prevents the decomposition of the ILs. Thermal gravity analysis (TGA) confirmed that no significant decomposition occurred during 5 min when [C8mim][TfO] was heated under nitrogen at 240 \u00b0C. The carryover tests were performed to prove that there is no carryover for the five PAHs for a desorption time of 1.5 min. Therefore, desorption at 240 \u00b0C for 1.5 min was chosen as the desorption condition. The MS scan mode was proceeded by selected ion monitoring (SIM), which could achieve very low detection limit (pg mL\u22121 level), the selection of specific ions for the five tested PAHs were first obtained from full scan mode, and the base peaks of them were selected.\nIt is well known that extraction temperature and time greatly influence the extraction efficiency for the solid phase microextraction process. Fig. 6 shows the peak area versus extraction temperature acquired by GC\u2013MS for the five PAHs in 10 mL DI water. There are two partition coefficients which impact the head space solid phase microextraction, one is the partition coefficient K h/s between the head space and sample solution, the other is the partition coefficient K f/h between SPME fiber and head space. A high temperature would increase the amount of analytes that evaporate to the head space (K h/s increased), as can be seen when the temperature increased, so the five PAHs peak areas increased, however, when the temperatures are higher than 50 \u00b0C, the peak areas of naphthalene, fluorene and anthracene dropped down. It is because their relatively high vapor pressures and diffusion rates made them diffuse back into the head space more easily (K f/h decreased). Consequently, 50 \u00b0C was adopted as the optimized extraction temperature.\nBecause SPME is a non-equivalent extraction method, it is important to find a minimum extraction time without losing sensitivity. Fig. 7 shows the GC\u2013MS peak area versus extraction time, it is clear that naphthalene and fluorene reach their saturation points within 20 min, while anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene require longer time to reach their saturation points. This is because of their relatively high boiling points and low diffusion rates. To balance the analysis time and sensitivity, 40 min was adopted as the optimized extraction time.\nIt is well known, the addition of salt may influence the solubility of analytes in the water sample, it was demonstrated that as the concentration of NaCl in water was increased, the PAHs solubility in the water decreased . In this study, because the head space SPME mode was adopted, the extraction efficiency was increased by decreasing the solubility of PAHs in the water. Fig. 8 shows the results of adding different amounts of NaCl to the water solution. As can be seen, the peak area of five PAHs increased dramatically from 10 to 20% (w/v) due to the salting out effect. However, when the amount of NaCl was increased to 30%, the increase in the peak area slowed down. It is worth noting that the peak area of naphthalene still increased whereas that of fluoranthene and pyrene decreased a little bit. The reason for these phenomena could be explained by the secondary effect of electrostatic interaction. When the concentration of NaCl is low, salting out is the primary effect. When the concentration of NaCl rises, the ionic strength of the solution increases and the secondary electrostatic effect became stronger and made the PAHs attracted in the solution. Therefore, 20%NaCl (w/v) was adopted for the following experiments.\nQuantitative analysis using this proposed method was evaluated by the determination of standard solutions; the method detection limit and other quantitation information for the five PAHs are tabulated in Table 3 . The calibration curves were constructed based on the peak area; the method detection limit (4\u20135 pg mL\u22121) was defined as three times that of the base-line noise. The precision (R.S.D.) of the system was evaluated by repeating each extraction and determination three times, and was in the range between 6 and 12%. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, two natural water samples were determined, one was rainwater collected in an industrial park, and the other was ground water collected on campus. By using the linear regressions of calibration curve shown in Table 3, the results of evaluation of the five PAHs in natural water samples were tabulated in Table 4 . For sample one, the rainwater collected in an industrial park, low concentration of naphthalene, fluorene and anthracene (29.7\u201370.0 pg mL\u22121) were found, these chemicals could have come from the exhaust of vehicles and factories. As for sample two, all the five PAHs were lower than the detection limit. This is because the PAHs are very hydrophobic compounds, so the solubilities of them in water are very low, especially for the larger PAHs such as fluoranthene and pyrene. However, good spiking recoveries were achieved for the five PAHs (80\u2013110%) at spiking level of 50 pg mL\u22121 (10 mL sample volume). Fig. 9 shows the chromatograms of sample one and standard sample of concentration level of 1 ng mL\u22121obtained by Nafion/[C8mim][TfO] fiber. The multiple peaks around 9.5\u201310.0 min came from the GC\u2013MS system; those peaks could be fragments which came from injection septum.\nThe lifetime of the homemade SPME device was evaluated after more than 50 analyses, using 50 ng spiked sample as the performance test sample. There is no significant variance since the fused silica tubing is relatively robust, and the IL and Nafion coatings can be easily removed by solvents and the fiber coating was renewed for every analysis. The lifetime of this device should be longer than the commercial SPME fiber.\nThis homemade ionic liquid SPME device is a very low cost (less than US$ 20), rapid and reliable analytical device. With the Nafion membrane coated before ionic liquid on the surface of fused silica tubing, the quantity of ionic liquid absorbed on the SPME fiber was increased, resulting in higher extraction efficiency. Combining the SPME with GC\u2013MS detection made this proposed method more effective. Furthermore, due to the task-specific property of ionic liquids, the ionic liquid coating could be varied by specific analytes by varying the substitution groups. This study showed that the ionic liquids are very promising in the trace analytical field; they could be applied to many other different analytes and matrixes for more selective and sensitive analysis.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are liquid in a temperature range around or below room temperature. They are fused salts containing a heterocyclic cation, such as dialkylimidazoluim ion or N-alkylpyrindinium ion and an anion, such as halides, BF4 \u2212, PF6 \u2212, CF3SO3 \u2212, NTf2 or other complex anions. These RTILs have several unique properties, including minuscule vapor pressure, non-flammability and dual natural polarity, making them greatly applicable in many physical and chemical fields. Furthermore, the properties (hydrophobicity, viscosity, thermal stability, etc.) can be varied by the alternation of the substitutive group on the cation or the combined anion; these unique properties make RTILs a task-specific material. Due to the non-volatility and tunable solubility, RTILs can be used as an alternative media for synthesis/catalysis , extraction and electrochemistry . Some utilizations have been also demonstrated for various analytical purposes, such as the stationary phase for gas chromatography or liquid chromatography , matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) , the mobile phase modifier in HPLC and for liquid phase microextraction and hybrid liquid\u2013solid phase microextraction . Two recently reported reviews also have compiled the applications of RTILs in analytical chemistry .\nSolid phase microextraction (SPME) is a fairly new sampling and pre-concentration technique, which possesses solvent free, fast diffusion rate and high enrichment factor properties . These make SPME a rapid and highly sensitive sample pretreatment method. In addition, the SPME sampling can be carried out directly from the liquid samples or from the head space over liquid or solid phases. Since the sensitivity of SPME depends on the analyte partition between the extraction fiber and sample solution (or head space), so the interaction between the analyte and the fiber would have a great influence on the partition coefficient. Previous studies showed that RTILs can be used as an alternative solvent for solvent extraction and liquid phase microextraction, showing comparable or even better extraction efficiency than conventionally used solvents. Recently, RTILs have been combined with SPME technique. Due to their relative high viscosity and thermal stability, the RTILs can be coated on the surface of fused silica capillary tubing in place of regular SPME fiber. Jiang and co-workers demonstrated that [C8mim][PF6] can be physically absorbed on the surface of fused silica tubing or stainless steel wire. Good results were obtained for the analysis of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) in paint samples. However, because the extraction efficiency is dependent on the quantity of IL-coated on the SPME fiber, this efficiency is still limited by the relatively low absorption force, and so the RTIL layer on the fiber was thin. In order to overcome this, Nafion membrane was introduced in this study to increase the amount of IL that absorbed on the fiber.\nIn this study, five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene were used as target compounds. The PAHs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants arising from a variety of sources such as fossil fuel combustion, oil spills and some industrial processes. They are an important class of contaminants and possible human carcinogens. Since the solubility of PAH in water is very low, it is very important to develop a highly sensitive analytical method to detect them in natural water .\nThe aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, robust and low cost SPME method that can be used for the analysis of PAHs in water samples. The objectives were therefore to investigate the effects of the various experimental parameters on the extraction efficiency. The combination of IL and SPME has a number of advantages over other water extraction techniques such as liquid\u2013liquid extraction or solid phase extraction. Combining the sampling and pre-concentration processes into a single step can reduce the risk of contamination and analyte loss. In addition, less solvent is required, making the technique more environmentally benign.\nThe selected RTILs in this research (1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate: [C8mim][TfO]; 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate: [Bemim][TfO] and 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate: [Phpromim][TfO]) were ordered from Merck (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The structures and densities of the three ILs are tabulated in Table 1 . The PAHs standards were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Louis, MO). Nafion 117 (5% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) solution was purchased from Fluka (Fluka, Switzerland). All solvents were of absolve grade (Merck) and the ultra pure deionized water was obtain from Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA).\nThe gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analyses were performed with a Finnigan MAT GCQ (Finnigan Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), which is an ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with EI/CI ionization sources. The system is controlled by X\u2019calibur software. An Rtx-5MS capillary-fused silica column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness, Restek. Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used for GC separation. The injection port of the GC was kept at 240 \u00b0C and operated with splitless mode. The temperature program of the GC oven was operated initially at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by heating to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C min\u22121 and held for another 2 min. Ultra high purity (99.9995%) helium was used as carrier gas (flow rate: 1.18 mL min\u22121). The mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact ionization (EI) mode (70 eV, 200 \u00b0C). The mass spectra of target compounds were acquired and quantified in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The quantitation ion and confirmation ion for each analyte were first obtained by full scan mode and the base peak and confirmation ion of each PAH were selected. The selected ions are summarized in Table 2 . The glass sample vials used for extraction were 18 mL in volume and capped with aluminum cap and PTFE-coated septum. All glass vials used in this study were first washed with detergent, deionized water and solvents (methanol, acetone and hexane in sequence), then silanized with dichlorodimethylsilane (10% in toluene at room temperature). Finally, the vials were dried and wrapped with aluminum foil before use. The sample solution was controlled by an aluminum heating block while being extracted at operating temperature.\nA homemade SPME device was adopted for coating ionic liquid film on its fiber. Fig. 1 shows the design of the homemade SPME, which is modified from the prototype designed by Jiang and co-workers . Capillary-fused silica tubing (10 cm \u00d7 0.05 mm i.d., Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix AZ) was employed as the needle tip of the device. After removing the polyimide outer layer (approx. 3 cm in length) and sealing both ends of the tubing with a microflame torch, the capillary tubing was inserted into a stainless steel needle (2 in Fig. 1), which functions as the piercing needle. A PTFE-coated septum was placed into the hub (3 in Fig. 1) of the piercing needle for gas-tightening. A PEEK capillary fingertight fitting (VICI, Jour Research AB, Switzerland) (5 in Fig. 1) with a tubing sleeve (1/16 \u00d7 0.0155, Upchurch scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) (4 in Fig. 1) was utilized to tighten the capillary, leaving only 1.0 cm bare fused silica tubing sticking out of the piercing needle (1 in Fig. 1). The bare fused silica tip can be withdrawn into (when standing by or moving the device) or extruded out of (for sampling or desorption in the GC injector) the piercing needle by pulling backward or pushing forward the PEEK fitting.\nThe bare fused silica tip was conditioned by being extruded out of the piercing needle and rinsed with the following solvents: methanol, acetone, hexane and dichloromethane in sequence, then inserted in the GC injector (kept at 240 \u00b0C) for 5 min. After the conditioning process, the fused silica tip was immersed into the Nafion solution for 30 s. The Nafion solution was used directly at the purchased concentration. Then, the Nafion fiber was dried in the air for 3 min. The fiber was then immersed into the IL solution (IL + dichloromethane, 9 + 1, v+v) for 1 min and dried in the air for 3 min again. The ionic liquid SPME experiments were carried out by coating brand-new IL fiber for every extraction. After the GC\u2013MS analysis, the residue on the fiber was washed out with solvents and re-conditioned again as described above.\nIn this study, the sampling method of the SPME was carried out by head space (HS) mode. The sample extraction temperature, time and the salt effect were studied. For establishing calibration curves (standard solutions spiked in DI water) and analyzing natural water samples, 10 mL of each sample was dispensed into an 18 mL silanized glass vial that contained 2 g of NaCl and a Teflon-coated stirring bar. The stock solution of the five mixed PAHs was prepared in methanol (1 mg mL\u22121 each analyte), then sequentially diluted into each working solution (concentration range: 0.01\u201310 \u03bcg mL\u22121). The method detection limits for five tested PAHs were evaluated by decreasing the spiked concentration of working solution in each 10 mL DI water followed by IL\u2013SPME and GC\u2013MS detection, until the signal to noise ratio of each peak of PAHs on the chromatogram dropped to around three. The calibration curves were prepared by spiking 0.1\u201350 ng of working solutions into each 10 mL DI water, the spiked volumes were 1\u201310 \u03bcL (depending on the required concentration).\nTo evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, two natural water samples were analyzed. One was the rainwater collected at an industrial park, the other was the ground water collected on campus. The two samples were filtrated through a 0.22 \u03bcm PVDF membrane and stored at 4 \u00b0C before use. The sample volume was 10 mL for each extraction. For evaluation of the precision and repeatability of this proposed method, each natural water sample was extracted and analyzed (n = 3) on the same day; for reproducibility, the samples were determined on another day. Spiking recoveries were performed by spiking 10 \u03bcL standards into the sample solution at a concentration level of 50 pg mL\u22121 (10 mL sample volume) for all five PAHs. The results were calculated by linear regression calibration curve.\nDirect coating of the ionic liquid on the fiber of the SPME device was first introduced by Jiang co-workers . They demonstrated that [C8mim][PF6] can be physically absorbed on the surface of a stainless steel wire or fused silica tubing. The addition of a small amount of dichloromethane (IL + DCM, 9 + 1, v+v) can improve the coating ability of the RTILs on the surface of the bare fused silica and stainless steel wire. The dichloromethane evaporated quickly and leaving a thin RTIL film on the surface of the SPME fiber. Although the hybrid ionic liquid\u2013solid phase microextraction could be used to determine the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) in paint water samples, the sensitivity was low, because of the relatively low amount of the IL absorbed on the SPME fiber. In this study, Nafion membrane was selected to be the supported media to increase the amount of absorbed IL on the SPME fiber. Nafion is a cation exchange polymer, which possesses SO3 \u2212 functional group. It would enhance the quantity and stability of IL absorbed on the fiber surface through the electrostatic interaction between IL and the Nafion-supported membrane. Fig. 2 shows the optical microscopic photographs of IL coatings with and without a Nafion-supported membrane. It is obvious that the force of gravity would make the IL coating slowly agglomerate on the bare fused silica tip. This could cause unwanted contact of IL with the piercing needle when the fiber was being withdrawn back. On the other hand, the bare fused silica tip precoated with the Nafion-supported membrane produced a much more even film. It is obvious that with the presence of a Nafion membrane, the IL spread well on the fused silica tubing surface; it could eliminate interferences when the fiber was withdrawn back into the piercing needle. Therefore, Nafion membrane was being coated prior to the IL coating process. The comparison of extraction efficiency (by peak area) of the fiber coating with and without a Nafion membrane is shown in Fig. 3 . As can be seen, the peak areas which were obtained from the IL fiber coating with a Nafion-supported membrane are greater than those without it. A blank test was conducted by coating the bare fused silica tip with only the Nafion membrane to determine the five PAHs sample solution, and no significant absorption of the five PAHs was observed. In addition, in order to compare the amount of absorbed IL onto the fiber. The absorbed IL ([C8mim][TfO]) were leached and collected by acetonitrile (ACN), followed by flow injection analysis\u2013electrospray\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (FIA\u2013ESI\u2013MS/MS). Fig. 4 shows the comparison of intensities of [C8mim] cation between precoating with and without Nafion. The amount of absorbed [C8mim][TfO] by Nafion precoated fiber is greater than Nafion-uncoated one. Therefore, it can be confirmed that a Nafion membrane could increase the absorbed amount of IL as well as stabilize the IL film on the surface of the SPME fiber and enhance the extraction efficiency for PAHs.\nThe type of substituted groups on the imidazolium cation may affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME method. In this study, three ILs: [C8mim][TfO], [Bemim][TfO] and [Phpromim][TfO] were examined. Fig. 5 shows the peak areas of PAHs extracted by the Nafion/IL-coated fibers using these three ILs. It is obvious that [C8mim][TfO] has the greatest extraction efficiency for the five PAHs among all tested ILs. The extraction efficiencies were [C8mim][TfO] > [Bemim][TfO] > [Phpromim][TfO]. This might be related to the difference in diffusion rate of tested ILs. The five PAHs molecules in the head space diffused easier into [C8mim][TfO] than into the other two ILs. It is interesting that although the extraction efficiencies of [Bemim][TfO] and [Phpromim][TfO] were lower than [C8mim][TfO], the extraction efficiency for the five PAHs increased by increasing the number of aromatic rings (from naphthalene to fluoranthene, except pyrene went down a little). These results could be influenced by the solubility effect. [Bemim][TfO] and [Phpromim][TfO] both posses phenyl substitution group, which has stronger induced dipolar interaction, resulting in greater solubility for larger PAHs. However, there were also other factors such as volatility and diffusion rate effect, and pyrene was suppressed. For the best extraction efficiency, [C8mim][TfO] was adopted for the routine analyses.\nThe amount of analytes desorbed from the SPME fiber would greatly influence the intensity of the GC\u2013MS acquisitions. Since the tested five PAHs are semivolatile compounds, they need relatively high temperature to desorb from the fiber. However, the higher temperature may cause the ILs to decompose. It is thus very important to find the adequate desorption temperature and time that permits quick desorption of the five PAHs and prevents the decomposition of the ILs. Thermal gravity analysis (TGA) confirmed that no significant decomposition occurred during 5 min when [C8mim][TfO] was heated under nitrogen at 240 \u00b0C. The carryover tests were performed to prove that there is no carryover for the five PAHs for a desorption time of 1.5 min. Therefore, desorption at 240 \u00b0C for 1.5 min was chosen as the desorption condition. The MS scan mode was proceeded by selected ion monitoring (SIM), which could achieve very low detection limit (pg mL\u22121 level), the selection of specific ions for the five tested PAHs were first obtained from full scan mode, and the base peaks of them were selected.\nIt is well known that extraction temperature and time greatly influence the extraction efficiency for the solid phase microextraction process. Fig. 6 shows the peak area versus extraction temperature acquired by GC\u2013MS for the five PAHs in 10 mL DI water. There are two partition coefficients which impact the head space solid phase microextraction, one is the partition coefficient K h/s between the head space and sample solution, the other is the partition coefficient K f/h between SPME fiber and head space. A high temperature would increase the amount of analytes that evaporate to the head space (K h/s increased), as can be seen when the temperature increased, so the five PAHs peak areas increased, however, when the temperatures are higher than 50 \u00b0C, the peak areas of naphthalene, fluorene and anthracene dropped down. It is because their relatively high vapor pressures and diffusion rates made them diffuse back into the head space more easily (K f/h decreased). Consequently, 50 \u00b0C was adopted as the optimized extraction temperature.\nBecause SPME is a non-equivalent extraction method, it is important to find a minimum extraction time without losing sensitivity. Fig. 7 shows the GC\u2013MS peak area versus extraction time, it is clear that naphthalene and fluorene reach their saturation points within 20 min, while anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene require longer time to reach their saturation points. This is because of their relatively high boiling points and low diffusion rates. To balance the analysis time and sensitivity, 40 min was adopted as the optimized extraction time.\nIt is well known, the addition of salt may influence the solubility of analytes in the water sample, it was demonstrated that as the concentration of NaCl in water was increased, the PAHs solubility in the water decreased . In this study, because the head space SPME mode was adopted, the extraction efficiency was increased by decreasing the solubility of PAHs in the water. Fig. 8 shows the results of adding different amounts of NaCl to the water solution. As can be seen, the peak area of five PAHs increased dramatically from 10 to 20% (w/v) due to the salting out effect. However, when the amount of NaCl was increased to 30%, the increase in the peak area slowed down. It is worth noting that the peak area of naphthalene still increased whereas that of fluoranthene and pyrene decreased a little bit. The reason for these phenomena could be explained by the secondary effect of electrostatic interaction. When the concentration of NaCl is low, salting out is the primary effect. When the concentration of NaCl rises, the ionic strength of the solution increases and the secondary electrostatic effect became stronger and made the PAHs attracted in the solution. Therefore, 20%NaCl (w/v) was adopted for the following experiments.\nQuantitative analysis using this proposed method was evaluated by the determination of standard solutions; the method detection limit and other quantitation information for the five PAHs are tabulated in Table 3 . The calibration curves were constructed based on the peak area; the method detection limit (4\u20135 pg mL\u22121) was defined as three times that of the base-line noise. The precision (R.S.D.) of the system was evaluated by repeating each extraction and determination three times, and was in the range between 6 and 12%. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, two natural water samples were determined, one was rainwater collected in an industrial park, and the other was ground water collected on campus. By using the linear regressions of calibration curve shown in Table 3, the results of evaluation of the five PAHs in natural water samples were tabulated in Table 4 . For sample one, the rainwater collected in an industrial park, low concentration of naphthalene, fluorene and anthracene (29.7\u201370.0 pg mL\u22121) were found, these chemicals could have come from the exhaust of vehicles and factories. As for sample two, all the five PAHs were lower than the detection limit. This is because the PAHs are very hydrophobic compounds, so the solubilities of them in water are very low, especially for the larger PAHs such as fluoranthene and pyrene. However, good spiking recoveries were achieved for the five PAHs (80\u2013110%) at spiking level of 50 pg mL\u22121 (10 mL sample volume). Fig. 9 shows the chromatograms of sample one and standard sample of concentration level of 1 ng mL\u22121obtained by Nafion/[C8mim][TfO] fiber. The multiple peaks around 9.5\u201310.0 min came from the GC\u2013MS system; those peaks could be fragments which came from injection septum.\nThe lifetime of the homemade SPME device was evaluated after more than 50 analyses, using 50 ng spiked sample as the performance test sample. There is no significant variance since the fused silica tubing is relatively robust, and the IL and Nafion coatings can be easily removed by solvents and the fiber coating was renewed for every analysis. The lifetime of this device should be longer than the commercial SPME fiber.\nThis homemade ionic liquid SPME device is a very low cost (less than US$ 20), rapid and reliable analytical device. With the Nafion membrane coated before ionic liquid on the surface of fused silica tubing, the quantity of ionic liquid absorbed on the SPME fiber was increased, resulting in higher extraction efficiency. Combining the SPME with GC\u2013MS detection made this proposed method more effective. Furthermore, due to the task-specific property of ionic liquids, the ionic liquid coating could be varied by specific analytes by varying the substitution groups. This study showed that the ionic liquids are very promising in the trace analytical field; they could be applied to many other different analytes and matrixes for more selective and sensitive analysis."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nAbout 30 years ago classical column liquid chromatography (CLC) merged into its modern variant high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Comprehensive treatment of the chromatographic processes gave clear directives as to how a highly efficient HPLC system should be designed and operated. With respect to column packings the requirements were to employ microparticulate and mechanically stable supports of 5\u201310 \u03bcm average particle size and to pack these particles in a stainless steel column to a dense and stable bed being held by porous frits. A small pulse of sample was injected on top of the column and separations were performed with a linear flow velocity of 1\u20135 mm/s.\nDuring this period the major source of silica packings for HPLC were mainly technical-grade silica xerogels of large particle size. They were subjected to consecutive milling and sizing processes to obtain 5\u201310-\u03bcm fractions with acceptable size distributions. For sizing microparticulate silicas novel sizing technology was developed by Alpine (Augsburg, Germany), based on air elutriation. To pack the material into columns, suspensions of these fine particles were filtered through stainless steel columns of 4 and 4.6 mm inner diameter, terminated by a porous frit, at high flow-rates of about 10 ml/min and pressures of up to 600 bar. As the particles were irregular in shape with fines adhering to the surface as a result of the milling process, the columns often showed a larger pressure drop than expected and a poor column longevity due to rearrangement of the particles in the packed bed during separation. As a consequence emphasis was placed on the development of processes by which spherical silica particles could be obtained without milling. However, sizing was still required to narrow the particle size distribution with some exceptions . The major siliceous precursors were sodium silicate solutions and stabilized silica sols. Beading was achieved by agglutination of silica sols in the presence of a monomer by converting droplets of silica sols into silica hydrogel beads in an immiscible two-phase system and by spray drying silica sols . Another route was to partially hydrolyze tetraethoxysilane to a condensed polyethoxysiloxane (PES) and to convert droplets of PES into spherical silica hydrogel beads by stirring in a heterogeneous phase . All these processes require meticulous control of the reaction parameters and a highly sophisticated technology.\nDuring the 1980s more refined processes were developed to better control the pore structural parameters, the particle size and to reduce the metal impurities in the bulk and the surface of the silicas (as an example see Ref. ). In addition, the parent silicas were subjected to specific post-synthetic treatments under hydrothermal conditions, treatment with acids and dehydroxylation/rehydroxylation cycles to stabilize the surface and to create a more homogeneous surface for consecutive chemical surface modification, for example, silanization .\nAnother feature was to control the residual hydroxyl group concentration of silanized silicas. Several attempts were undertaken such as the use of silanes with protective side chains (sterically protected silicas) , the formation of an intermediate hydrophilic layer prior to silanization and the formation of so-called end-capped silicas. The objective was to manufacture reversed-phase silicas suitable for the resolution of basic analytes.\nAn additional route to adjust the hydrophilic character of the silica surface relative to its hydrophobicity is to prepare porous silica/organic hybrid particles by cohydrolysis and cocondensation of tetraethoxysilane and organoalkoxysilanes .\nNovel routes in the design and processing of silica packings should include the following features:\n(i) processes which enable one to manufacture beads with controlled particle size and size distribution without any subsequent size fractionation;\n(ii) adjustable and reproducible pore structural parameters carried out in situ by control of the reaction parameters;\n(iii) defined and reproducible surface chemistry of the silica; and\n(iv) reproducible and rugged manufacturing process.\nIt was during 1980 that we started to reinvestigate so called the Stoeber process. Stoeber et al. developed a procedure to synthesize monodisperse non-porous silica particles of about 1 \u03bcm size . Tetraethoxysilane was hydrolyzed and condensed in an ethanolic ammonia solution to form silica hydrogel beads, which were then subjected to calcination. By a controlled growth process of the Stoeber particles we were able to manufacture non-porous particles of up to 3 \u03bcm . After chemical modification we applied this non-porous packing in reversed-phase (RPLC), ion-exchange (IEC) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) of peptides and proteins . The particles were packed into short columns of 30\u00d74 mm and operated at high flow-rates of up to 5 ml/min with a column back pressure of up to 300 bar. The separations were performed in less than 1 min with optimized HPLC systems . Later Barder and Dubois and Kovats et al. , developed similar procedures. Nowadays, the columns are commercially available from Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg and Eichrom, USA (formerly Micra Scientific, USA).\nParallel to research on non-porous silica packings we dealt with the synthesis of silica-rich zeolites of the MFI structure type. The objective was to understand the role of the structure directing agents (templates) during the nucleation and crystallization of these zeolites; and to synthesize template-free materials with the aim of adjusting the particle size of the crystals, within the range of about 100 nm diameter up to about 300 \u03bcm.\nMFI zeolites possess a three-dimensional pore system with pore diameters between 0.5 and 0.6 nm, which are too small to be used in HPLC. Hence, these tailor-made materials were exclusively employed as catalysts .\nWhen Mobil researchers first reported the synthesis of ordered mesoporous silicas such as MCM-41 we concentrated on efforts to utilize this concept to process tailor-made silica packings. The classical synthesis of MCM-41 is carried out with a silicate solution and long chain n-alkyl ammonium salts at elevated temperatures of about 100\u00b0C . The detergent molecules form micelles with the silicate anion species via a process of cooperative interaction and the latter are attached to the outer surface of the micelles . In the case of MCM-41 these micelles are ordered into hexagonally packed rods that form a so-called mesostructured phase with the micelles in the interior of the rods whose walls consists of amorphous silica. Thus, the detergent builds a supramolecular structure rather than ordering on a molecular scale as seen in the MFI synthesis where the template directs the bulk structure. A unidimensional pore system is created and the average pore diameter can be tuned by the n-alkyl chain length of the surfactant employed. The detergent molecules are burned out of the silica leaving a porous material with amorphous silica walls of about 1 nm thickness.\nThe specific surface area amounts to >1000 m2/g and the specific pore volume ranges between 0.8 and 2 ml/g. The material is an agglomerated silica of primary particles of about 50 nm diameter. Due to the high porosity and the agglomerated structure the material does not withstand high pressure and, therefore, cannot be used as a packing material for HPLC. In 1995 we synthesized spherical MCM-41 and MCM-48 material using tetraethoxysilane and long chain n-alkyltrimethylammonium bromides or n-alkylpyridinium bromides as structure directing agents . It was Tanev and Pinnavaia , however, who first employed n-alkylamines as templates. Yet this synthesis procedure did not yield particles of spherical morphology. The breakthrough occurred when we carried out the hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane with long-chain n-alkylamines in aqueous ammonia solutions at a pH of 10 (according to Stoeber) using isopropanol as the co-solvent . The procedure is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . The reaction started with a homogeneous solution at room temperature or higher. Neither autoclaves nor stirring were required. The average particle diameter of the particles precipitated could be varied and particles having a nearly monodisperse particle size distribution were yielded (see Fig. 2 ). The mechanism of formation is certainly not analogous to that of MCM-41, i.e., the material does not exhibit a regular packing of pores (long-range order) as seen in MCM-41. X-ray diffractograms at low 2\u03b8 values indicate the presence of one peak instead of four as with the MCM-41 material (see Fig. 3 ). Control of pore size and porosity was achieved by different methods with respect to the MCM-41 synthesis. The particle size was controlled by the water\u2013TEOS molar ratio in the starting reaction mixture as well as by the reaction temperature, namely within the range of 15\u201340\u00b0C.\nThe particular advantage of this method is the stringent control of the particle morphology and particle size which makes sizing into fractions unnecessary. This implies that there is no loss of material due to under and oversizes. The most favourable range of average particle diameter is between 0.2 and 2 \u03bcm. Usually the average pore diameter is in the range between 2 and 5 nm. Pore size enlargement is achieved either by a post-synthetic hydrothermal treatment under specific conditions or by using oligomeric and polymeric templates. The silicas obtained are much more hydrothermally stable than amorphous silica xerogels and MCM-41 types of silica. An example is the collapse of long-range order and the pore structure of MCM-41 with hydrothermal treatment. With respect to the surface hydroxyl group concentration the silica products discussed possess an \u03b1 OH value between 4 and 5 \u03bcmol/m2, whereas a fully hydroxylated amorphous silica has a \u03b1 OH value of 8\u20139 \u03bcmol/m2 and MCM-41 as a representative of an ordered mesoporous silica has an \u03b1 OH value of 2\u20134 \u03bcmol/m2 .\nIt should be emphasized in this context that monodisperse micron and submicron size polymer beads, e.g., based on polystyrene\u2013divinylbenzene, have been also synthesized.\nThe state-of-the-art in column technology in HPLC was recently reviewed by Rozing and Majors . Typically, columns of 100\u2013250 mm length and 4 and 4.6 mm inner diameter packed with 5-\u03bcm reversed-phase silicas are routinely employed. Short columns of about 50 mm in length and 4 and 7 mm I.D. packed with 3\u20134-\u03bcm materials are offered by a number of column manufacturers for fast separations in the order of minutes.\nThere is, however, a major limitation with respect to the sizing technology of the silica particles that have an average particle diameter of d p<3 \u03bcm. The sizing of narrow fractions of d p \u223c1\u20132 \u03bcm by the air elutriation techniques are extremely time consuming, expensive and also less efficient. The same considerations are valid for sedimentation as an alternative sizing technique.\nNon-porous reversed-phase silica columns (1.5\u20132 \u03bcm) with 33\u00d74.6 (4.0) mm inner diameter are commercially available. Due to the low surface area of the column and the low column dead volume of about 200 \u03bcl, a number of precautions have to be taken into account: as the specific surface area is about 100 times lower than a traditional reversed-phase silica the column loadability is also reduced by the same factor. When transferring retention protocols from porous to non-porous reversed-phase columns the water content of the eluent has to be increased with a simultaneous decrease in the content of organic solvent.\nThe extra column volume contributions must be minimized such as injection volume, capillary connections and volume and geometry of the detector cell to achieve the expected column performance and sensitivity. The data sampling rate of the detector should be 50 Hz to monitor fast separations with sufficient accuracy. A survey of the chromatographic application and the handling of Micra ODS columns is reported by Lamotte .\nThe most serious drawback of the 1.5 \u03bcm non-porous reversed-phase silica column is the high column pressure drop. Even for short columns it amounts to about 150\u2013200 bar with a flow-rate of 1\u20132 ml/min. It can be reduced by enhancing the column temperature to about 40\u00b0C. Table 1 displays a survey of three types of columns namely A, B and C and their chromatographic properties. Type A belongs to type of columns that are applied for routine HPLC analysis, type B is employed for fast separations and type C corresponds to columns packed with 1.5-\u03bcm non-porous silicas, as discussed above.\nTo overcome the pressure limitations of reversed-phase silica columns of d p<3 \u03bcm, columns with a continuous bed were introduced (SilicaRod columns, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). These columns are composed of a continuous system of flow-through pores of about 1\u20132 \u03bcm and mesopores of about 10 nm . The columns can be run at high flow-rates of up to 7 ml/min without any significant loss in column performance. The pressure drop is about 5 times lower than that of 5-\u03bcm reversed-phase columns at comparable conditions . Packed capillaries with 300 \u03bcm I.D. have found applications in reversed-phase gradient elution of peptides and polypeptides but not in routine HPLC analysis.\nIn conclusion the most striking advantage of HPLC as a separation technique is its selectivity potential through the possible combination of stationary phase and mobile phase.\nFor fast miniaturized separations the major limitations are:\n(i) the high pressure drop (for microparticulate columns) to generate and to maintain a hydraulic flow in parallel miniaturized devices; and\n(ii) the column performance which is controlled by the eddy-diffusion (term A) and the mass transfer (term C) in the Van Deemter equation. The plate height can never be smaller than H\u223c2d p, due to the A term in the case of packed microparticulate columns as well as for columns with a continuous bed.\nCapillary electrophoresis (CE) offers an outstanding column performance (see Table 2 ). However, the selectivity is restricted to ionic analytes. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) opens up great potential for non-charged analytes, but it does have a number of drawbacks. With respect to fast miniaturized separation systems CE has enormous potential: CE can be performed in small channels in microfluidic systems in a highly parallel fashion.\nCapillary electrochromatography (CEC) is a hybrid technique of Micro-HPLC and CE . Modified CE equipment is employed with fused-silica capillaries of 400\u2013500 mm length and 50\u2013100 \u03bcm I.D. These capillaries are packed with 3-\u03bcm reversed-phase silicas which are usually employed in HPLC, for example, Hypersil ODS. An electrical potential of up to \u221230 kV is applied. Samples are injected either electrokinetically or by pressure. Detection is performed by UV. Due to the surface charge of the capillary wall and the negative charge of the surface of the silica particles, characterized by the zeta potential, an electroosmotic flow (EOF) is generated which moves the eluent towards the cathode. An isostatic pressure is applied to both sides of the capillaries to avoid bubble formation. Capillaries packed with 3 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas generate about five times higher plate numbers than in micro-HPLC (pressure driven) under identical conditions using the same analytes. However, an increase in the column plate number by a factor of 5 is not a dramatic improvement.\nCEC, however, offers the advantage of using smaller particles with an average particle diameter significantly lower than 3 \u03bcm and hence a much higher efficiency. The reason for this is that no pressure drop is generated in this electroosmotically driven system. Capillaries with 1\u20132 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas were already used in some studies. Upon further reduction of the average particle diameter two questions immediately arise: (1) Is there a limit in minimum particle size with respect to maintenance of the EOF? (2) Does one get the predicted column efficiency from these columns (H\u223c0.5d p)?\nWe found that capillaries packed with 0.2-, 0.5-, 1- and 3 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas generate identical EOF versus field strength dependencies . The experimental findings were confirmed by model calculations . We also found that CEC columns packed with 0.5 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas did not provide the expected column performance (plate height H\u223c0.5d p). The plate number achieved was similar to that of 2 \u03bcm CEC capillaries at otherwise constant conditions. We assume that the EOF that was 3 mm/s was too low to operate this column under optimum conditions (about 6 mm/s).\nWith the current commercially available CEC equipment three major limitations exist for the operation of short capillary columns with submicron size reversed-phase silicas:\n(i) the maximum potential is about \u221230 kV and the maximum field strength about 800 V/cm at a column length of 400 mm;\n(ii) the minimum column length is about 400 mm (packed part 80 mm, unpacked part 320 mm);\n(iii) the column is not thermostatically controlled.\nFig. 4 shows as an example the separation of digoxin and its metabolites in less than 2 min on a CEC column packed with 0.5 \u03bcm n-octyl-bonded silica. In general, CEC has the potential to be down-sized to microfluidic fast and high throughput separation systems. The major obstacles in this approach are:\nthe ruggedness and longevity of CEC columns do not yet meet the current requirements;\nthe parameters controlling the EOF are not yet fully understood (likewise for the conditions to achieve and to maintain a reproducible EOF);\nthere are no fundamental studies elucidating the retention and selectivity of charged and polar analytes, respectively, in CEC.\nAmong the chromatographic and electrokinetic separation methods CE and CEC bear the largest potential to become the powerhouses in fast miniaturized separation systems. CEC as compared to CE has the advantage of being an orthogonal method to CE and micro-HPLC. CEC is applicable to both ionic and nonionic analytes. It should be emphasized that the success of miniaturized separation systems is by and large determined by the design and development of highly efficient sample clean-up systems.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "About 30 years ago classical column liquid chromatography (CLC) merged into its modern variant high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Comprehensive treatment of the chromatographic processes gave clear directives as to how a highly efficient HPLC system should be designed and operated. With respect to column packings the requirements were to employ microparticulate and mechanically stable supports of 5\u201310 \u03bcm average particle size and to pack these particles in a stainless steel column to a dense and stable bed being held by porous frits. A small pulse of sample was injected on top of the column and separations were performed with a linear flow velocity of 1\u20135 mm/s.\nDuring this period the major source of silica packings for HPLC were mainly technical-grade silica xerogels of large particle size. They were subjected to consecutive milling and sizing processes to obtain 5\u201310-\u03bcm fractions with acceptable size distributions. For sizing microparticulate silicas novel sizing technology was developed by Alpine (Augsburg, Germany), based on air elutriation. To pack the material into columns, suspensions of these fine particles were filtered through stainless steel columns of 4 and 4.6 mm inner diameter, terminated by a porous frit, at high flow-rates of about 10 ml/min and pressures of up to 600 bar. As the particles were irregular in shape with fines adhering to the surface as a result of the milling process, the columns often showed a larger pressure drop than expected and a poor column longevity due to rearrangement of the particles in the packed bed during separation. As a consequence emphasis was placed on the development of processes by which spherical silica particles could be obtained without milling. However, sizing was still required to narrow the particle size distribution with some exceptions . The major siliceous precursors were sodium silicate solutions and stabilized silica sols. Beading was achieved by agglutination of silica sols in the presence of a monomer by converting droplets of silica sols into silica hydrogel beads in an immiscible two-phase system and by spray drying silica sols . Another route was to partially hydrolyze tetraethoxysilane to a condensed polyethoxysiloxane (PES) and to convert droplets of PES into spherical silica hydrogel beads by stirring in a heterogeneous phase . All these processes require meticulous control of the reaction parameters and a highly sophisticated technology.\nDuring the 1980s more refined processes were developed to better control the pore structural parameters, the particle size and to reduce the metal impurities in the bulk and the surface of the silicas (as an example see Ref. ). In addition, the parent silicas were subjected to specific post-synthetic treatments under hydrothermal conditions, treatment with acids and dehydroxylation/rehydroxylation cycles to stabilize the surface and to create a more homogeneous surface for consecutive chemical surface modification, for example, silanization .\nAnother feature was to control the residual hydroxyl group concentration of silanized silicas. Several attempts were undertaken such as the use of silanes with protective side chains (sterically protected silicas) , the formation of an intermediate hydrophilic layer prior to silanization and the formation of so-called end-capped silicas. The objective was to manufacture reversed-phase silicas suitable for the resolution of basic analytes.\nAn additional route to adjust the hydrophilic character of the silica surface relative to its hydrophobicity is to prepare porous silica/organic hybrid particles by cohydrolysis and cocondensation of tetraethoxysilane and organoalkoxysilanes .\nNovel routes in the design and processing of silica packings should include the following features:\n(i) processes which enable one to manufacture beads with controlled particle size and size distribution without any subsequent size fractionation;\n(ii) adjustable and reproducible pore structural parameters carried out in situ by control of the reaction parameters;\n(iii) defined and reproducible surface chemistry of the silica; and\n(iv) reproducible and rugged manufacturing process.\nIt was during 1980 that we started to reinvestigate so called the Stoeber process. Stoeber et al. developed a procedure to synthesize monodisperse non-porous silica particles of about 1 \u03bcm size . Tetraethoxysilane was hydrolyzed and condensed in an ethanolic ammonia solution to form silica hydrogel beads, which were then subjected to calcination. By a controlled growth process of the Stoeber particles we were able to manufacture non-porous particles of up to 3 \u03bcm . After chemical modification we applied this non-porous packing in reversed-phase (RPLC), ion-exchange (IEC) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) of peptides and proteins . The particles were packed into short columns of 30\u00d74 mm and operated at high flow-rates of up to 5 ml/min with a column back pressure of up to 300 bar. The separations were performed in less than 1 min with optimized HPLC systems . Later Barder and Dubois and Kovats et al. , developed similar procedures. Nowadays, the columns are commercially available from Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg and Eichrom, USA (formerly Micra Scientific, USA).\nParallel to research on non-porous silica packings we dealt with the synthesis of silica-rich zeolites of the MFI structure type. The objective was to understand the role of the structure directing agents (templates) during the nucleation and crystallization of these zeolites; and to synthesize template-free materials with the aim of adjusting the particle size of the crystals, within the range of about 100 nm diameter up to about 300 \u03bcm.\nMFI zeolites possess a three-dimensional pore system with pore diameters between 0.5 and 0.6 nm, which are too small to be used in HPLC. Hence, these tailor-made materials were exclusively employed as catalysts .\nWhen Mobil researchers first reported the synthesis of ordered mesoporous silicas such as MCM-41 we concentrated on efforts to utilize this concept to process tailor-made silica packings. The classical synthesis of MCM-41 is carried out with a silicate solution and long chain n-alkyl ammonium salts at elevated temperatures of about 100\u00b0C . The detergent molecules form micelles with the silicate anion species via a process of cooperative interaction and the latter are attached to the outer surface of the micelles . In the case of MCM-41 these micelles are ordered into hexagonally packed rods that form a so-called mesostructured phase with the micelles in the interior of the rods whose walls consists of amorphous silica. Thus, the detergent builds a supramolecular structure rather than ordering on a molecular scale as seen in the MFI synthesis where the template directs the bulk structure. A unidimensional pore system is created and the average pore diameter can be tuned by the n-alkyl chain length of the surfactant employed. The detergent molecules are burned out of the silica leaving a porous material with amorphous silica walls of about 1 nm thickness.\nThe specific surface area amounts to >1000 m2/g and the specific pore volume ranges between 0.8 and 2 ml/g. The material is an agglomerated silica of primary particles of about 50 nm diameter. Due to the high porosity and the agglomerated structure the material does not withstand high pressure and, therefore, cannot be used as a packing material for HPLC. In 1995 we synthesized spherical MCM-41 and MCM-48 material using tetraethoxysilane and long chain n-alkyltrimethylammonium bromides or n-alkylpyridinium bromides as structure directing agents . It was Tanev and Pinnavaia , however, who first employed n-alkylamines as templates. Yet this synthesis procedure did not yield particles of spherical morphology. The breakthrough occurred when we carried out the hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane with long-chain n-alkylamines in aqueous ammonia solutions at a pH of 10 (according to Stoeber) using isopropanol as the co-solvent . The procedure is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . The reaction started with a homogeneous solution at room temperature or higher. Neither autoclaves nor stirring were required. The average particle diameter of the particles precipitated could be varied and particles having a nearly monodisperse particle size distribution were yielded (see Fig. 2 ). The mechanism of formation is certainly not analogous to that of MCM-41, i.e., the material does not exhibit a regular packing of pores (long-range order) as seen in MCM-41. X-ray diffractograms at low 2\u03b8 values indicate the presence of one peak instead of four as with the MCM-41 material (see Fig. 3 ). Control of pore size and porosity was achieved by different methods with respect to the MCM-41 synthesis. The particle size was controlled by the water\u2013TEOS molar ratio in the starting reaction mixture as well as by the reaction temperature, namely within the range of 15\u201340\u00b0C.\nThe particular advantage of this method is the stringent control of the particle morphology and particle size which makes sizing into fractions unnecessary. This implies that there is no loss of material due to under and oversizes. The most favourable range of average particle diameter is between 0.2 and 2 \u03bcm. Usually the average pore diameter is in the range between 2 and 5 nm. Pore size enlargement is achieved either by a post-synthetic hydrothermal treatment under specific conditions or by using oligomeric and polymeric templates. The silicas obtained are much more hydrothermally stable than amorphous silica xerogels and MCM-41 types of silica. An example is the collapse of long-range order and the pore structure of MCM-41 with hydrothermal treatment. With respect to the surface hydroxyl group concentration the silica products discussed possess an \u03b1 OH value between 4 and 5 \u03bcmol/m2, whereas a fully hydroxylated amorphous silica has a \u03b1 OH value of 8\u20139 \u03bcmol/m2 and MCM-41 as a representative of an ordered mesoporous silica has an \u03b1 OH value of 2\u20134 \u03bcmol/m2 .\nIt should be emphasized in this context that monodisperse micron and submicron size polymer beads, e.g., based on polystyrene\u2013divinylbenzene, have been also synthesized.\nThe state-of-the-art in column technology in HPLC was recently reviewed by Rozing and Majors . Typically, columns of 100\u2013250 mm length and 4 and 4.6 mm inner diameter packed with 5-\u03bcm reversed-phase silicas are routinely employed. Short columns of about 50 mm in length and 4 and 7 mm I.D. packed with 3\u20134-\u03bcm materials are offered by a number of column manufacturers for fast separations in the order of minutes.\nThere is, however, a major limitation with respect to the sizing technology of the silica particles that have an average particle diameter of d p<3 \u03bcm. The sizing of narrow fractions of d p \u223c1\u20132 \u03bcm by the air elutriation techniques are extremely time consuming, expensive and also less efficient. The same considerations are valid for sedimentation as an alternative sizing technique.\nNon-porous reversed-phase silica columns (1.5\u20132 \u03bcm) with 33\u00d74.6 (4.0) mm inner diameter are commercially available. Due to the low surface area of the column and the low column dead volume of about 200 \u03bcl, a number of precautions have to be taken into account: as the specific surface area is about 100 times lower than a traditional reversed-phase silica the column loadability is also reduced by the same factor. When transferring retention protocols from porous to non-porous reversed-phase columns the water content of the eluent has to be increased with a simultaneous decrease in the content of organic solvent.\nThe extra column volume contributions must be minimized such as injection volume, capillary connections and volume and geometry of the detector cell to achieve the expected column performance and sensitivity. The data sampling rate of the detector should be 50 Hz to monitor fast separations with sufficient accuracy. A survey of the chromatographic application and the handling of Micra ODS columns is reported by Lamotte .\nThe most serious drawback of the 1.5 \u03bcm non-porous reversed-phase silica column is the high column pressure drop. Even for short columns it amounts to about 150\u2013200 bar with a flow-rate of 1\u20132 ml/min. It can be reduced by enhancing the column temperature to about 40\u00b0C. Table 1 displays a survey of three types of columns namely A, B and C and their chromatographic properties. Type A belongs to type of columns that are applied for routine HPLC analysis, type B is employed for fast separations and type C corresponds to columns packed with 1.5-\u03bcm non-porous silicas, as discussed above.\nTo overcome the pressure limitations of reversed-phase silica columns of d p<3 \u03bcm, columns with a continuous bed were introduced (SilicaRod columns, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). These columns are composed of a continuous system of flow-through pores of about 1\u20132 \u03bcm and mesopores of about 10 nm . The columns can be run at high flow-rates of up to 7 ml/min without any significant loss in column performance. The pressure drop is about 5 times lower than that of 5-\u03bcm reversed-phase columns at comparable conditions . Packed capillaries with 300 \u03bcm I.D. have found applications in reversed-phase gradient elution of peptides and polypeptides but not in routine HPLC analysis.\nIn conclusion the most striking advantage of HPLC as a separation technique is its selectivity potential through the possible combination of stationary phase and mobile phase.\nFor fast miniaturized separations the major limitations are:\n(i) the high pressure drop (for microparticulate columns) to generate and to maintain a hydraulic flow in parallel miniaturized devices; and\n(ii) the column performance which is controlled by the eddy-diffusion (term A) and the mass transfer (term C) in the Van Deemter equation. The plate height can never be smaller than H\u223c2d p, due to the A term in the case of packed microparticulate columns as well as for columns with a continuous bed.\nCapillary electrophoresis (CE) offers an outstanding column performance (see Table 2 ). However, the selectivity is restricted to ionic analytes. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) opens up great potential for non-charged analytes, but it does have a number of drawbacks. With respect to fast miniaturized separation systems CE has enormous potential: CE can be performed in small channels in microfluidic systems in a highly parallel fashion.\nCapillary electrochromatography (CEC) is a hybrid technique of Micro-HPLC and CE . Modified CE equipment is employed with fused-silica capillaries of 400\u2013500 mm length and 50\u2013100 \u03bcm I.D. These capillaries are packed with 3-\u03bcm reversed-phase silicas which are usually employed in HPLC, for example, Hypersil ODS. An electrical potential of up to \u221230 kV is applied. Samples are injected either electrokinetically or by pressure. Detection is performed by UV. Due to the surface charge of the capillary wall and the negative charge of the surface of the silica particles, characterized by the zeta potential, an electroosmotic flow (EOF) is generated which moves the eluent towards the cathode. An isostatic pressure is applied to both sides of the capillaries to avoid bubble formation. Capillaries packed with 3 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas generate about five times higher plate numbers than in micro-HPLC (pressure driven) under identical conditions using the same analytes. However, an increase in the column plate number by a factor of 5 is not a dramatic improvement.\nCEC, however, offers the advantage of using smaller particles with an average particle diameter significantly lower than 3 \u03bcm and hence a much higher efficiency. The reason for this is that no pressure drop is generated in this electroosmotically driven system. Capillaries with 1\u20132 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas were already used in some studies. Upon further reduction of the average particle diameter two questions immediately arise: (1) Is there a limit in minimum particle size with respect to maintenance of the EOF? (2) Does one get the predicted column efficiency from these columns (H\u223c0.5d p)?\nWe found that capillaries packed with 0.2-, 0.5-, 1- and 3 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas generate identical EOF versus field strength dependencies . The experimental findings were confirmed by model calculations . We also found that CEC columns packed with 0.5 \u03bcm reversed-phase silicas did not provide the expected column performance (plate height H\u223c0.5d p). The plate number achieved was similar to that of 2 \u03bcm CEC capillaries at otherwise constant conditions. We assume that the EOF that was 3 mm/s was too low to operate this column under optimum conditions (about 6 mm/s).\nWith the current commercially available CEC equipment three major limitations exist for the operation of short capillary columns with submicron size reversed-phase silicas:\n(i) the maximum potential is about \u221230 kV and the maximum field strength about 800 V/cm at a column length of 400 mm;\n(ii) the minimum column length is about 400 mm (packed part 80 mm, unpacked part 320 mm);\n(iii) the column is not thermostatically controlled.\nFig. 4 shows as an example the separation of digoxin and its metabolites in less than 2 min on a CEC column packed with 0.5 \u03bcm n-octyl-bonded silica. In general, CEC has the potential to be down-sized to microfluidic fast and high throughput separation systems. The major obstacles in this approach are:\nthe ruggedness and longevity of CEC columns do not yet meet the current requirements;\nthe parameters controlling the EOF are not yet fully understood (likewise for the conditions to achieve and to maintain a reproducible EOF);\nthere are no fundamental studies elucidating the retention and selectivity of charged and polar analytes, respectively, in CEC.\nAmong the chromatographic and electrokinetic separation methods CE and CEC bear the largest potential to become the powerhouses in fast miniaturized separation systems. CEC as compared to CE has the advantage of being an orthogonal method to CE and micro-HPLC. CEC is applicable to both ionic and nonionic analytes. It should be emphasized that the success of miniaturized separation systems is by and large determined by the design and development of highly efficient sample clean-up systems."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nThin polymer films with thicknesses of tens of nanometers are studied extensively because they provide an ideal sample geometry for studying the effects of one-dimensional confinement on the structure, morphology and dynamics of the polymer molecules, and because they are used extensively in technological applications such as optical coatings, protective coatings, adhesives, barrier layers and packaging materials.\nA polymer molecule can be described on a variety of different length scales, ranging from the size of the individual monomers to the overall size of the molecule R ee. The characteristic time scales range from that corresponding to segmental relaxation, related to the glass transition, to that corresponding to the motion of entire chains. By confining polymer molecules to dimensions that are comparable to the different length scales characterizing the molecules, the motion of the molecules can be significantly different than in bulk. For example, the effect of confinement on the segmental motion of polymers has been studied using a variety of experimental geometries: interfaces in semicrystalline polymers , polymer solutions in porous glasses , polymers intercalated into the 2 nm gaps of layered compounds , polymer spheres with diameters of tens of nanometers , and thin polymer films.\nThe thin film sample geometry is appealing since it is straightforward to control the interactions at the free surface and film\u2223substrate interface, and it is possible to produce films of uniform thickness, and therefore uniform confinement, which can be varied continuously from nanometers to micrometers. In this way, it is possible to probe the effect of one-dimensional confinement on the dynamics of polymer molecules on a variety of length scales comparable to those of the polymer molecules. To probe the molecular mobility in thin polymer films, it is necessary to use techniques that have high sensitivity, because of the small sample volume, or surface sensitivity, which is advantageous because of the large surface-to-volume ratio in thin films. In general, traditional techniques used to probe the glass transition and whole chain motion in bulk samples, e.g. differential scanning calorimetry and neutron scattering, do not have sufficient sensitivity. It is possible to prepare and measure stacks of identical films using bulk techniques , but the requirements for sample preparation are very demanding. Instead, new techniques have been developed and existing techniques have been adapted to obtain measures of the molecular mobility on different length scales in thin polymer films.\nIn Section 2, we describe the results of recent experimental studies of the glass transition in thin polymer films. Considerable evidence has been obtained that the glass transition temperature T g of thin polymer films can be substantially different from that in bulk (see, for example ). In contrast, it is found that whole chain motion in thin polymer films is not substantially different from that in bulk, as discussed in Section 3. A discussion and summary of the results are given in Section 4.\nIn the simplest picture, the glass transition describes the change from a rubber-like liquid to a glassy or amorphous solid as a material is cooled. A detailed understanding of the glass transition in bulk samples has remained elusive; for a discussion of the relevant issues, see . However, the concepts of free volume and cooperative motion have been useful in trying to explain the dramatic reduction in molecular mobility with decreasing temperature. The motion of individual particles in a glass-forming material requires sufficient free volume into which the particles can move. As the temperature is decreased, the density increases and it becomes increasingly difficult for a particle to find sufficient free volume for motion to occur on a reasonable time scale . One way to achieve motion at low temperatures is to allow a cooperative rearrangement of neighbouring particles such that many particles must move together if any motion is to occur at all. Adam and Gibbs postulated the existence of cooperatively rearranging regions or CRRs as the smallest regions at a given temperature that can rearrange independent of neighbouring regions, with the size of the CRR increasing with decreasing temperature. Experiments indicate that the size of these regions is several nanometers . The possible existence of the cooperativity length scale of Adam and Gibbs allows for the possibility of observing so-called finite-size effects in which the size of the sample becomes comparable to the cooperativity length scale as the temperature is varied. Finite size effects on T g were first observed by Jackson and McKenna for simple liquids confined within porous glasses with pore diameters on the nanometer scale. This original work has led to extensive experimental and theoretical studies of the effect of confinement on the glass transition using a variety of different sample geometries and different molecules (see, for example ). We will focus on experimental results obtained for polymer molecules confined to supported and freely standing thin films.\nThe first systematic study of the dependence of the glass transition temperature T g on film thickness in thin polymer films was performed by Keddie et al. using ellipsometry. In the ellipsometry experiment, the measured change in polarization of light upon reflection from or transmission through the polymer film is used to obtain the thickness h and index of refraction n of the film. To measure the glass transition temperature, the film thickness is measured as a function of temperature, and the temperature corresponding to the near discontinuous change in the thermal expansion is identified as T g. Keddie et al. prepared a series of polystyrene (PS) films on the native oxide layer of silicon wafers with film thicknesses 10 nm < h < 200 nm and molar masses 120 \u00d7 103 < M w < 2900 \u00d7 103. They measured reductions in T g for h < 40 nm, with quantitatively similar results for all M w values. The data were fitted to an empirical function based on the assumption of the existence of a liquid-like layer at the free surface of the film: Tg(h)=Tgbulk1-\u03b1h\u03b4, where \u03b1 = 3.2 nm and \u03b4 = 1.8. A compilation of results obtained for PS films on a variety of substrates using numerous experimental techniques such as ellipsometry , dielectric spectroscopy , X-ray reflectivity , positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) , local thermal analysis and probe fluorescence intensity is shown in Fig. 1 . The trend in the data shown in Fig. 1 is clear: there is a decrease in T g with decreasing film thickness for all of the data, with good quantitative agreement between data obtained using the different techniques. Since similar results are obtained for PS films on different substrates, one can conclude that the PS films interact only weakly with the underlying substrates. This is not always the case. The importance of the effect of the polymer-substrate interaction on the measured T g value was first observed for the case of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films on Au surfaces and the native silicon oxide layer of silicon wafers. T g decreased with decreasing film thickness for PMMA films on Au, but a modest increase in T g was observed with decreasing film thickness for PMMA films on silicon oxide . Subsequently, evidence for a strongly attractive interaction between the polymer and underlying substrate was observed in X-ray reflectivity measurements of poly-(2)-vinylpyridine on a silicon oxide layer on silicon as an increase in T g with decreasing thickness .\nAs can be seen from the data presented in Fig. 1, there are several different experimental techniques that have been used to measure T g in supported thin polymer films. All of these techniques probe the material properties averaged across the thickness of the film, yielding an average T g value for the film. However, it is important to determine whether each of these techniques measures the same physical quantity, e.g. is the T g value measured by ellipsometry and dielectric relaxation (DR) the same physical quantity? Recent DR measurements of isotactic PMMA sandwiched between Al electrodes and ellipsometry measurements of isotactic PMMA on Al substrates show at least qualitative agreement between the T g values determined using both techniques. Such comparisons are important for a proper discussion of T g results obtained using different experimental techniques.\nThe determination of T g becomes more difficult as the film thickness is decreased for several reasons: (1) there is a reduction in signal strength because less material is being probed in the experiment; (2) there is a reduction in the contrast between the slopes characterizing the glass and melt regions; and (3) there is a broadening of the transition . Items (2) and (3) have been shown to be consistent with the presence of a thin liquid-like layer at the free surface . Despite these effects which make the determination of T g difficult, T g values have been obtained for films with thicknesses as small as 6 nm (see Fig. 1).\nThe presence of the film surfaces creates environments for the polymer segments in contact with the surface that differ from that of segments within the film. In particular, it is reasonable to expect that segments in contact with a free surface are more mobile. Most theoretical models that have been proposed to explain T g reductions in very thin polymer films begin with this premise and account for variations in segmental mobility across the film thickness as well as novel mechanisms by which the enhanced mobility near the free surface can be transferred deeper into the film .\nRecently, it has been suggested that attention should be focused on measurements of the distribution of T g values across the thickness of the film , rather than measurements of the average T g value. In response to this suggestion, Ellison and Torkelson have applied the probe fluorescence technique to multilayer films incorporating thin layers which contain small quantities of fluorescent probes (either probe molecules or probe-labeled polymer molecules) . The authors have verified that the temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity provided a measure of the temperature dependence of the density and therefore the T g value of the film, and that there is not substantial segregation of the probe molecules to one or both film surfaces. By using the multilayer geometry and varying the position of the fluorescently tagged layer within the film, the authors were able to obtain the distribution of T g values across the thickness of the film. They found a decrease in T g near a free surface which extends several tens of nanometers into the film . This large length scale for the effect of the free surface on T g is considerably larger than that inferred from other measurements on polymer films and for other systems using other techniques (see below) which have been interpreted in terms of models with layers of different mobility based on measurements of average T g values. In addition, Ellison and Torkelson have shown that the magnitude of the reduction in T g at the free surface can also depend on the overall thickness of the film for films with thicknesses less than the spatial extent of the enhanced mobility at a free surface.\nSeveral studies have focused on measuring the distribution of \u03b1-relaxation times in thin polymer films, using the techniques of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric relaxation (DR) spectroscopy . These studies have allowed a detailed determination of the \u03b1-relaxation time distribution in the films. The SHG experiments, performed on a copolymer of isobutyl methacrylate and dye-functionalized methacrylate monomer, revealed no change in the average \u03b1-relaxation time with decreasing film thickness, with a corresponding broadening of the \u03b1-relaxation time distribution with decreasing film thickness. However, the interaction between the large amounts of dye labels and the substrate may have caused the invariance of the average \u03b1-relaxation time with film thickness . DR spectroscopy was used by Fukao et al. to study thin films of PS, poly(vinyl acetate) and atactic PMMA. For the PS films, the glass transition temperature was identified as the discontinuous change in the temperature dependence of the capacitance which is determined by the thermal expansion of the polymer film . T g values determined in this manner decreased with decreasing film thickness in agreement with the results of other techniques (see Fig. 1). The average \u03b1-relaxation temperature T \u03b1 was observed to decrease with decreasing film thickness but only below a threshold film thickness value that was small compared with film thicknesses for which T g reductions were observed using other techniques. In addition, the width of the \u03b1-relaxation peak \u0394T \u03b1 was observed to broaden with decreasing film thickness. Subsequent DR measurements of isotactic PMMA (i-PMMA), which has a large dielectric \u03b1-relaxation signal, revealed a decrease in T g with decreasing film thickness, together with a broadening of the relaxation time distribution and a reduction in the dielectric strength for the \u03b1-relaxation process . In this study, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time \u03c4\u03b1max corresponding to the maximum in the \u03b1-relaxation loss peak was fitted to a Vogel\u2013Fulcher function of the form \u03c4\u03b1max=Aexp[TA/(T-T0)], where T A is an \u201cactivation temperature\u201d, T 0 is the temperature at which the exponential factor diverges to infinity (typically T g \u2013 50 K for polymers), and A is a temperature-independent prefactor. T g was identified as the temperature at which \u03c4\u03b1max was equal to 100 s. The multilayer film geometry has also been used recently in dielectric relaxation studies of polymer trilayer films consisting of a dielectrically active layer (i-PMMA) sandwiched between two layers of a different polymer (PS) . T g values for the i-PMMA layers were determined by applying an activation energy fine-structure analysis to the dielectric data. A slight increase in T g with decreasing i-PMMA film thickness was observed, which is qualitatively different from the decrease in T g with decreasing film thickness observed for the same i-PMMA films in contact with the metallic electrodes. Dielectric relaxation measurements of i-PMMA films with one free surface have shown that the \u03b1-process measured at 1 kHz was the same with and without the electrode in contact with the top surface of the polymer film for film thicknesses down to 7 nm . This result is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the presence of thin capping layers on polymer films have no measurable effect on the T g(h) dynamics .\nThe experimental data obtained for polymer films supported on substrates indicate that the presence of the free surface tends to decrease T g, whereas the presence of the underlying substrate can tend to increase T g. The T g value measured for a particular polymer\u2013substrate combination will depend on which film interface dominates. To clarify the role of the free surface on the measured T g value, the underlying substrate was removed and freely standing polymer films, with air\u2223polymer interfaces on both sides of the film, were studied . Data points obtained using transmission ellipsometry for freely standing films of narrow distribution PS for different M w values within the range 575 \u00d7 103 < M w < 9100 \u00d7 103 are indicated with symbols in Fig. 2 . The T g values obtained using transmission ellipsometry are the same to within experimental uncertainty as the T g values measured using Brillouin light scattering (BLS) in the original measurements of freely standing PS films . This is particularly significant since the two techniques measure different physical properties of the films: BLS measures the light scattering from the rippling of the film surfaces due to thermally excited, film-guided acoustic phonons and is insensitive to film thickness, whereas the ellipsometry signal is determined by multiple reflections of light from the two film surfaces and yields a measure of the film thickness . Because the BLS signal is determined by the surface ripple, the signal strength does not decrease with decreasing film thickness, unlike all of the other experimental techniques that have been used to probe the glass transition in freely standing polymer films.\nThe most striking feature of the data presented in Fig. 2 is that the T g reductions are much larger for freely standing films than they are for supported films. The data obtained for each M w value has the same qualitative dependence on film thickness h: a constant T g value equal to that in bulk for sufficiently thick films, and a linear reduction in T g with h for h less than a threshold film thickness value h 0. This dependence of T g on h can be interpreted as the interplay between two types of mobility: the bulk mechanism which dominates for sufficiently thick films, and a new mode of mobility which becomes more efficient than the bulk mechanism for sufficiently thin films, resulting in reduced T g values . de Gennes has suggested a mechanism for propagating the mobility of the near-surface segments to depths comparable to the overall size of the polymer molecules, which could give rise to T g reductions over length scales comparable to the overall size of the polymer molecules.\nFor the T g(h) data in Fig. 2, there is also a systematic dependence on M w: an increase in the slope of T g versus h and the threshold film thickness value h 0 with increasing M w. The dependence of the T g(h) data on M w, or equivalently the overall size of the molecules, is unexpected because the glass transition is associated with motion on a much smaller, segmental length scale and also because the T g(h) data obtained for supported polymer films show no measurable dependence on M w . This so-called chain confinement effect, in which deviations from bulk behaviour are dependent on the overall size of the polymer molecules, is unique to high M w freely standing PS films. The freely standing PS film data are even more remarkable if one fits the film thickness dependence of the reduced T g data for each M w value and extrapolates the straight line fits to larger temperature: all six of the straight lines, one for each M w value, intersect at a single point (h*, T g*) . The existence of the intersection point means that, by empirically accounting for the M w-dependence, all of the reduced T g values in Fig. 2 can be replotted as a universal scaling plot, as shown in Fig. 3 . The collapse of all of the data onto a single line is remarkable. However, the physical significance of the intersection point is not yet understood. To determine if the remarkable scaling behaviour shown in Fig. 2 is specific to PS or is more general, measurements have begun on freely standing films of another polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). T g measurements on freely standing films of atactic PMMA (a-PMMA) of a single M w value have been reported . A comparison of the T g(h) data obtained for freely standing PS and a-PMMA films of nearly equivalent M w values is shown in Fig. 4 . The same qualitative dependence of T g on h is observed for both data sets, but the magnitude of the T g reductions at a given film thickness below the threshold film thickness value is substantially less for the a-PMMA films than for the PS films. This indicates that theoretical models which are proposed to explain T g reductions in freely standing polymer films will need to account for polymer-specific properties, e.g. chemical structure or steric hindrance.\nMeasurements performed on films with M w < 350 \u00d7 103 (low M w) have revealed T g reductions with decreasing film thickness that are comparable in absolute terms to those observed with larger M w values, but there is no significant M w-dependence of the T g(h) behaviour for the low M w films (see the solid curve in Fig. 2) . The lack of M w-dependence of the T g reductions observed for the low M w values is reminiscent of the behaviour observed for supported polymer films. In fact, the T g reductions for low M w freely standing polymer films are essentially twice as large as those observed for supported polymer films, suggesting that the magnitude of the T g reduction scales with the number of free surfaces . The low M w freely standing polymer film experimental results have been interpreted in terms of a three layer model in which the layers at the free surfaces are assumed to be more mobile, and the results are consistent with free surface layers which have temperature dependent thicknesses that scale with temperature in the same manner as the cooperativity length scale .\nThere are several intriguing aspects to the T g data obtained for freely standing polymer films. First, the existence of the common intersection point on the plot of T g versus h for films with different, large M w values (see Fig. 2) is striking, but its significance is not yet known. Second, the crossover between a M w-dependence for high M w films, indicative of chain confinement effects, and a lack of M w-dependence for low M w films is not understood. Third, the glass transition observed with both BLS and ellipsometry is very sharp (only several \u00b0C) for all film thicknesses, whereas one would expect that the existence of more mobile surface layers would produce a broadening of the transition for very thin films. All of these aspects of the freely standing polymer film T g results are intriguing and deserve more careful study.\nRecently, T g measurements have been performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of aqueous suspensions of PS spheres with diameters of tens of nanometers . It is reasonable to compare these results with those obtained for freely standing polymer films because the spheres in aqueous suspension in the absence of aggregation are in contact only with water and therefore are essentially unsupported. By placing many spheres in the suspension, while taking care to avoid aggregation, it was possible to obtain a sufficient signal using DSC, a technique that is commonly used to measure T g in bulk samples. In this study, the jump in the specific heat associated with the transition was observed to decrease with decreasing sphere diameter, and these results were interpreted in terms of a central core with bulk dynamics and an outer shell of 4 nm thickness with faster dynamics. The measured T g values were not substantially less than the bulk value, in contrast to the large T g reductions obtained for freely standing PS films. In comparing the results of this study with those obtained for freely standing films, it is important to note two important differences: (1) The PS spheres were produced by microemulsion polymerization in the presence of small quantities of surfactant molecules (to stabilize the spheres in suspension) and therefore have larger polydispersity, different surface character and less chain orientation than for spincoated PS freely standing films; (2) The nature of the confinement is different and this has implications for the equilibration of the samples. Obviously, there is a qualitative difference in the confinement of the polymer molecules: within the spheres, the polymer molecules are confined in three dimensions, instead of the one-dimensional confinement produced in very thin polymer films. The sphere geometry is appealing since it is an equilibrium shape that minimizes the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This allows the spheres to be heated above the bulk T g value without the instabilities that are inherent to thin polymer films (see Section 3.2 below).\nThe first indication of enhanced mobility in thin polymer films was inferred from optical microscopy studies by Reiter of the breakup or dewetting of thin polymer films at temperatures less than the bulk value of T g . These measurements necessarily involve motion of entire polymer molecules due to the formation and growth of holes in the films. Subsequent measurements of whole chain mobility in thin polymer films have focused on diffusion using fluorescently tagged probe and polymer molecules, diffusion at interfaces between two films, and detailed studies of dewetting and hole formation and growth in thin polymer films. Using these techniques, information has been obtained about whole chain motion both parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the film.\nThe first measurements of in-plane chain diffusion were carried out by Frank et al. using fluorescence recovery after patterned photobleaching (FRAPP) using fluorescently labelled PS molecules. They found that the in-plane chain diffusion in thin films was substantially slower for film thicknesses as large as 150 nm compared with that measured for very thick films. In subsequent FRAP measurements of in-plane diffusion of rubrene dye molecules in thin PS films at different temperatures, an increase in mobility was observed with decreasing film thickness, but evidence for probe segregation to the film surfaces was also obtained . Although the average concentration of dye molecules in the films is low (0.6\u20133% by mass), segregation of the dye molecules to the free surface results in much larger concentrations which could artificially enhance the measured diffusion in the near-surface region.\nThere have been considerably more studies of diffusion perpendicular to the plane of the film. Fluorescence nonradiative energy transfer (NRET) measurements of films containing layers of acceptor and donor molecules have been performed to measure diffusion perpendicular to the plane of the film, and these measurements have revealed a decrease in the diffusion coefficient for films less than 150 nm thick . Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) has been used by Rafailovich and coworkers to measure the diffusion perpendicular to the film plane on a variety of different multilayer film geometries incorporating thin layers of deuterated PS (dPS) and layers of hydrogenated PS (hPS) , and for freely standing PS films incorporating short dPS chains as probe molecules . The dynamic SIMS measurements have revealed that the diffusion coefficient is either reduced from the bulk value over substantial distances from the substrate and the free surface , or indistinguishable from that in bulk for freely standing PS films incorporating probe molecules . Neutron reflectometry was used to measure diffusion perpendicular to the film plane for the interface in dPS/hPS bilayer films , and it was found that the diffusion coefficient in thin films was unchanged from that in bulk, except for a slight decrease in the diffusion coefficient with the interface placed near the substrate. Kawaguchi et al. have recently used dynamic SIMS and neutron reflectometry to study the interdiffusion of the interface in hPS/dPS bilayer films. They observed interface broadening at temperatures below Tgbulk, indicating that there was some enhancement of mobility at the interface compared with the bulk. Boiko and Prud\u2019homme have used lap-shear strength measurements on PS/PS interfaces which indicate that there is some interdiffusion at temperatures below Tgbulk .\nHow can we reconcile the measurements of diffusion coefficients in thin polymer films, which in general show either a decrease or no change with respect to the bulk, with the observation of reduced T g, which implies enhanced segmental mobility, in similar films? What about comparisons between the diffusion coefficient results for thin polymer films and those obtained from computer simulations of confined polymer molecules, which show increased diffusion parallel to the film plane and decreased diffusion perpendicular to the film plane (see )? To make meaningful comparisons, it is important to measure the temperature dependence of the mobility at different length scales. In particular, it is important to ask whether or not time-temperature superposition holds for the two types of motion, i.e. can the temperature dependence of the mobility at the different length scales be described by Eq. 2 using the same values of T A and T 0, as it does (to a reasonable approximation) in bulk. Comparisons made at a single temperature could give differences that are due to a thickness dependence of the prefactor A in Eq. 2 instead of a difference in the temperature-dependent factor . To properly compare the mobility at different length scales, it is important to measure the temperature dependence and to compare the values of T 0. Despite the importance of measuring the temperature dependence of the diffusion in thin polymer films, only very few studies to date have provided this information. Clearly, more effort in this area is required to make a proper evaluation of the dynamics at different length scales.\nWhole chain motion in thin polymer films can also be probed by exploiting instabilities that are inherent to thin films. Thin polymer films can be susceptible to the formation of holes when heated to temperatures that are comparable to or greater than the bulk glass transition temperature Tgbulk. Obviously, if holes form and grow in the films, entire polymer molecules must move. This motion occurs initially perpendicular to the film plane, for the hole to form across the entire film thickness, and then is predominantly in the plane of the film, as the hole grows. In the absence of external fields, the instability can be driven by the van der Waals or dispersion interaction which can be substantial for film thicknesses h < 100 nm . For films supported on substrates, it is possible for the dispersion interaction between the two film surfaces to be attractive such that the film of uniform thickness breaks up into droplets via a process known as dewetting , or repulsive, which enhances the stability of the films . Unsupported or freely standing polymer films are always unstable to the formation and growth of holes at elevated temperatures , since the dispersion interaction is always attractive for this film geometry which is symmetric about the midplane of the film . Holes can form via two different mechanisms: they can be nucleated by external perturbations or defects, such as dust or density inhomogeneities; or they can form spontaneously due to amplification of long-wavelength fluctuations of the film surfaces by the attractive dispersion or van der Waals interaction between the two film surfaces. In the case of nucleation, holes with radii R greater than a critical value R c grow with time, where R c = h/2 . In the case of spontaneous hole formation, holes can form in the film due to the interplay between the dispersion and surface tension contributions to the free energy .\nThe stresses due to the dispersion interaction and surface tension which drive hole formation and growth are large in very thin films. Therefore, the whole chain motion in hole formation and growth experiments can be considerably more complicated than that observed in chain diffusion experiments due to the presence of large stresses and the importance of nonlinear viscoelastic effects. Recent studies of the dewetting of supported PS films using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) at temperatures close to Tgbulk have suggested that hole growth may occur, not by polymer flow, but rather by yielding or plastic deformation of the polymer due to the very large stresses that are produced by the interactions that drive the hole growth . The importance of nonlinear viscoelastic effects in interpreting these experimental results has also been considered .\nMeasurements of hole formation and growth in freely standing polymer films are particularly interesting because of the very large reductions in T g, indicative of enhanced segmental motion, that have been observed for these films . Hole formation and growth in freely standing films was first measured using optical microscopy , in which the growth of a single hole was tracked in time. The hole radius was observed to grow exponentially with time: R(t) = R0et/\u03c4, where \u03c4 is the characteristic growth time. For freely standing PS films , it was found that \u03c4 decreased with decreasing film thickness h. This result was interpreted in terms of the bulk phenomenon of shear thinning in which the film viscosity at the edge of the hole, \u03b7 = \u03c4\u03f5/h, where \u03f5 is the surface tension, decreased with increasing shear strain rate \u03b3\u02d9=2/\u03c4, according to a power law dependence \u03b7\u223c\u2223\u03b3\u02d9\u2223-d with d = 0.65 \u00b1 0.03. We have recently developed a differential pressure experiment (DPE) to measure the growth of holes in freely standing PS films at temperatures above and below Tgbulk for thicknesses that are sufficiently small such that the measured T g values as measured using ellipsometry are reduced from the bulk value . A very small pressure difference (less than 10\u22124 atm) is applied across a freely standing polymer film, and the position of a piston is controlled to maintain a constant pressure difference across the film. When the film is heated, holes form and grow and the piston must move in one direction to maintain the constant pressure difference. The time dependence of the piston position provides a signature for hole formation and growth and it can be analysed to obtain the characteristic growth time \u03c4 . The pressure difference applied across the film does not influence the formation or growth of the holes; it is chosen to be as small as possible while still allowing the detection of the holes.\nThe characteristic growth times \u03c4 measured at different temperatures using the DPE for freely standing PS films with M w = 2240 \u00d7 103 and three different thicknesses are shown in Fig. 5 . The T g values of the freely standing PS films were 97 (bulk value), 66 and 25 \u00b0C for films with h = 91, 68 and 51 nm, respectively . Unfortunately, \u03c4 can be obtained only for a limited range of temperatures, since measurements of the characteristic growth time \u03c4 are limited by the rapid growth of holes at temperatures T>Tgbulk. The small shifts in temperature between the different data sets shown in Fig. 5 can be explained in terms of the bulk phenomenon of shear thinning . The main result of this study is that substantial hole growth occurs only for temperatures that are comparable to Tgbulk, which for very thin films can be considerably higher than the reduced T g values. Thus, the DPE results indicate that despite considerable mobility present on a segmental length scale in these films, hole growth and corresponding whole chain motion does not occur until temperatures close to the bulk value of T g are reached.\nWe have described considerable experimental evidence that shows that segmental mobility can be enhanced in very thin polymer films while the motion of entire chains is unchanged from that in bulk. In particular, the results obtained for freely standing polymer films are unique and remarkable, with very large reductions in the glass transition temperature and no corresponding enhancement of whole chain motion for very thin films. Several ideas have been proposed to resolve this apparent contradiction : a variation in mobility across the thickness of the films, differences in the polymer mobility parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the films, and decoupling of segmental and chain motions in thin polymer films. The current situation is that there are several possible explanations, but no definitive resolution, for this issue, and it highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the mobility being probed in a given experiment so that meaningful comparisons of different experimental studies can be made. Another key issue centres on the length scale over which changes in mobility can be observed, and the fluorescently tagged multilayer films studied in hold much promise to elucidate more completely the detailed T g behaviour near free polymer surfaces and within thin polymer films. The nonequilibrium nature of thin polymer films, which are produced by spincoating techniques and cannot be fully annealed at temperatures greater than T g due to the inherent instability discussed in Section 3, is a potential concern since spincoating can produce radial alignment and reduced entanglement of the polymer chains with corresponding anisotropy in the physical properties. However, recent studies have shown that possible reductions in entanglement density in spincoated polymer films are not responsible for T g reductions in thin polymer films .\nThe development of new experimental techniques to study the dynamics of polymers at free surfaces provides the promise of new insights, but additional effort is required to develop the proper analysis of the data, especially those involving mechanical deformation of polymers at elevated temperatures, so that the results obtained using different techniques can be meaningfully compared. In addition, computer simulations and theoretical models have been developed to learn in detail about the structure and dynamics of confined glassy liquids. A recent discussion of the free surface experiments, the computer simulations and the theoretical models is given in .\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in understanding the effect of the film interfaces and free surfaces on the glass transition and whole chain motion. The use of new and improved experimental techniques and sophisticated sample geometries, combined with advances in theoretical analyses and computer simulations, will ensure that the study of dynamics in thin polymer films remains a rich area of research, leading to a deeper understanding of mobility of confined polymer molecules on different length scales.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Thin polymer films with thicknesses of tens of nanometers are studied extensively because they provide an ideal sample geometry for studying the effects of one-dimensional confinement on the structure, morphology and dynamics of the polymer molecules, and because they are used extensively in technological applications such as optical coatings, protective coatings, adhesives, barrier layers and packaging materials.\nA polymer molecule can be described on a variety of different length scales, ranging from the size of the individual monomers to the overall size of the molecule R ee. The characteristic time scales range from that corresponding to segmental relaxation, related to the glass transition, to that corresponding to the motion of entire chains. By confining polymer molecules to dimensions that are comparable to the different length scales characterizing the molecules, the motion of the molecules can be significantly different than in bulk. For example, the effect of confinement on the segmental motion of polymers has been studied using a variety of experimental geometries: interfaces in semicrystalline polymers , polymer solutions in porous glasses , polymers intercalated into the 2 nm gaps of layered compounds , polymer spheres with diameters of tens of nanometers , and thin polymer films.\nThe thin film sample geometry is appealing since it is straightforward to control the interactions at the free surface and film\u2223substrate interface, and it is possible to produce films of uniform thickness, and therefore uniform confinement, which can be varied continuously from nanometers to micrometers. In this way, it is possible to probe the effect of one-dimensional confinement on the dynamics of polymer molecules on a variety of length scales comparable to those of the polymer molecules. To probe the molecular mobility in thin polymer films, it is necessary to use techniques that have high sensitivity, because of the small sample volume, or surface sensitivity, which is advantageous because of the large surface-to-volume ratio in thin films. In general, traditional techniques used to probe the glass transition and whole chain motion in bulk samples, e.g. differential scanning calorimetry and neutron scattering, do not have sufficient sensitivity. It is possible to prepare and measure stacks of identical films using bulk techniques , but the requirements for sample preparation are very demanding. Instead, new techniques have been developed and existing techniques have been adapted to obtain measures of the molecular mobility on different length scales in thin polymer films.\nIn Section 2, we describe the results of recent experimental studies of the glass transition in thin polymer films. Considerable evidence has been obtained that the glass transition temperature T g of thin polymer films can be substantially different from that in bulk (see, for example ). In contrast, it is found that whole chain motion in thin polymer films is not substantially different from that in bulk, as discussed in Section 3. A discussion and summary of the results are given in Section 4.\nIn the simplest picture, the glass transition describes the change from a rubber-like liquid to a glassy or amorphous solid as a material is cooled. A detailed understanding of the glass transition in bulk samples has remained elusive; for a discussion of the relevant issues, see . However, the concepts of free volume and cooperative motion have been useful in trying to explain the dramatic reduction in molecular mobility with decreasing temperature. The motion of individual particles in a glass-forming material requires sufficient free volume into which the particles can move. As the temperature is decreased, the density increases and it becomes increasingly difficult for a particle to find sufficient free volume for motion to occur on a reasonable time scale . One way to achieve motion at low temperatures is to allow a cooperative rearrangement of neighbouring particles such that many particles must move together if any motion is to occur at all. Adam and Gibbs postulated the existence of cooperatively rearranging regions or CRRs as the smallest regions at a given temperature that can rearrange independent of neighbouring regions, with the size of the CRR increasing with decreasing temperature. Experiments indicate that the size of these regions is several nanometers . The possible existence of the cooperativity length scale of Adam and Gibbs allows for the possibility of observing so-called finite-size effects in which the size of the sample becomes comparable to the cooperativity length scale as the temperature is varied. Finite size effects on T g were first observed by Jackson and McKenna for simple liquids confined within porous glasses with pore diameters on the nanometer scale. This original work has led to extensive experimental and theoretical studies of the effect of confinement on the glass transition using a variety of different sample geometries and different molecules (see, for example ). We will focus on experimental results obtained for polymer molecules confined to supported and freely standing thin films.\nThe first systematic study of the dependence of the glass transition temperature T g on film thickness in thin polymer films was performed by Keddie et al. using ellipsometry. In the ellipsometry experiment, the measured change in polarization of light upon reflection from or transmission through the polymer film is used to obtain the thickness h and index of refraction n of the film. To measure the glass transition temperature, the film thickness is measured as a function of temperature, and the temperature corresponding to the near discontinuous change in the thermal expansion is identified as T g. Keddie et al. prepared a series of polystyrene (PS) films on the native oxide layer of silicon wafers with film thicknesses 10 nm < h < 200 nm and molar masses 120 \u00d7 103 < M w < 2900 \u00d7 103. They measured reductions in T g for h < 40 nm, with quantitatively similar results for all M w values. The data were fitted to an empirical function based on the assumption of the existence of a liquid-like layer at the free surface of the film: Tg(h)=Tgbulk1-\u03b1h\u03b4, where \u03b1 = 3.2 nm and \u03b4 = 1.8. A compilation of results obtained for PS films on a variety of substrates using numerous experimental techniques such as ellipsometry , dielectric spectroscopy , X-ray reflectivity , positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) , local thermal analysis and probe fluorescence intensity is shown in Fig. 1 . The trend in the data shown in Fig. 1 is clear: there is a decrease in T g with decreasing film thickness for all of the data, with good quantitative agreement between data obtained using the different techniques. Since similar results are obtained for PS films on different substrates, one can conclude that the PS films interact only weakly with the underlying substrates. This is not always the case. The importance of the effect of the polymer-substrate interaction on the measured T g value was first observed for the case of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films on Au surfaces and the native silicon oxide layer of silicon wafers. T g decreased with decreasing film thickness for PMMA films on Au, but a modest increase in T g was observed with decreasing film thickness for PMMA films on silicon oxide . Subsequently, evidence for a strongly attractive interaction between the polymer and underlying substrate was observed in X-ray reflectivity measurements of poly-(2)-vinylpyridine on a silicon oxide layer on silicon as an increase in T g with decreasing thickness .\nAs can be seen from the data presented in Fig. 1, there are several different experimental techniques that have been used to measure T g in supported thin polymer films. All of these techniques probe the material properties averaged across the thickness of the film, yielding an average T g value for the film. However, it is important to determine whether each of these techniques measures the same physical quantity, e.g. is the T g value measured by ellipsometry and dielectric relaxation (DR) the same physical quantity? Recent DR measurements of isotactic PMMA sandwiched between Al electrodes and ellipsometry measurements of isotactic PMMA on Al substrates show at least qualitative agreement between the T g values determined using both techniques. Such comparisons are important for a proper discussion of T g results obtained using different experimental techniques.\nThe determination of T g becomes more difficult as the film thickness is decreased for several reasons: (1) there is a reduction in signal strength because less material is being probed in the experiment; (2) there is a reduction in the contrast between the slopes characterizing the glass and melt regions; and (3) there is a broadening of the transition . Items (2) and (3) have been shown to be consistent with the presence of a thin liquid-like layer at the free surface . Despite these effects which make the determination of T g difficult, T g values have been obtained for films with thicknesses as small as 6 nm (see Fig. 1).\nThe presence of the film surfaces creates environments for the polymer segments in contact with the surface that differ from that of segments within the film. In particular, it is reasonable to expect that segments in contact with a free surface are more mobile. Most theoretical models that have been proposed to explain T g reductions in very thin polymer films begin with this premise and account for variations in segmental mobility across the film thickness as well as novel mechanisms by which the enhanced mobility near the free surface can be transferred deeper into the film .\nRecently, it has been suggested that attention should be focused on measurements of the distribution of T g values across the thickness of the film , rather than measurements of the average T g value. In response to this suggestion, Ellison and Torkelson have applied the probe fluorescence technique to multilayer films incorporating thin layers which contain small quantities of fluorescent probes (either probe molecules or probe-labeled polymer molecules) . The authors have verified that the temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity provided a measure of the temperature dependence of the density and therefore the T g value of the film, and that there is not substantial segregation of the probe molecules to one or both film surfaces. By using the multilayer geometry and varying the position of the fluorescently tagged layer within the film, the authors were able to obtain the distribution of T g values across the thickness of the film. They found a decrease in T g near a free surface which extends several tens of nanometers into the film . This large length scale for the effect of the free surface on T g is considerably larger than that inferred from other measurements on polymer films and for other systems using other techniques (see below) which have been interpreted in terms of models with layers of different mobility based on measurements of average T g values. In addition, Ellison and Torkelson have shown that the magnitude of the reduction in T g at the free surface can also depend on the overall thickness of the film for films with thicknesses less than the spatial extent of the enhanced mobility at a free surface.\nSeveral studies have focused on measuring the distribution of \u03b1-relaxation times in thin polymer films, using the techniques of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric relaxation (DR) spectroscopy . These studies have allowed a detailed determination of the \u03b1-relaxation time distribution in the films. The SHG experiments, performed on a copolymer of isobutyl methacrylate and dye-functionalized methacrylate monomer, revealed no change in the average \u03b1-relaxation time with decreasing film thickness, with a corresponding broadening of the \u03b1-relaxation time distribution with decreasing film thickness. However, the interaction between the large amounts of dye labels and the substrate may have caused the invariance of the average \u03b1-relaxation time with film thickness . DR spectroscopy was used by Fukao et al. to study thin films of PS, poly(vinyl acetate) and atactic PMMA. For the PS films, the glass transition temperature was identified as the discontinuous change in the temperature dependence of the capacitance which is determined by the thermal expansion of the polymer film . T g values determined in this manner decreased with decreasing film thickness in agreement with the results of other techniques (see Fig. 1). The average \u03b1-relaxation temperature T \u03b1 was observed to decrease with decreasing film thickness but only below a threshold film thickness value that was small compared with film thicknesses for which T g reductions were observed using other techniques. In addition, the width of the \u03b1-relaxation peak \u0394T \u03b1 was observed to broaden with decreasing film thickness. Subsequent DR measurements of isotactic PMMA (i-PMMA), which has a large dielectric \u03b1-relaxation signal, revealed a decrease in T g with decreasing film thickness, together with a broadening of the relaxation time distribution and a reduction in the dielectric strength for the \u03b1-relaxation process . In this study, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time \u03c4\u03b1max corresponding to the maximum in the \u03b1-relaxation loss peak was fitted to a Vogel\u2013Fulcher function of the form \u03c4\u03b1max=Aexp[TA/(T-T0)], where T A is an \u201cactivation temperature\u201d, T 0 is the temperature at which the exponential factor diverges to infinity (typically T g \u2013 50 K for polymers), and A is a temperature-independent prefactor. T g was identified as the temperature at which \u03c4\u03b1max was equal to 100 s. The multilayer film geometry has also been used recently in dielectric relaxation studies of polymer trilayer films consisting of a dielectrically active layer (i-PMMA) sandwiched between two layers of a different polymer (PS) . T g values for the i-PMMA layers were determined by applying an activation energy fine-structure analysis to the dielectric data. A slight increase in T g with decreasing i-PMMA film thickness was observed, which is qualitatively different from the decrease in T g with decreasing film thickness observed for the same i-PMMA films in contact with the metallic electrodes. Dielectric relaxation measurements of i-PMMA films with one free surface have shown that the \u03b1-process measured at 1 kHz was the same with and without the electrode in contact with the top surface of the polymer film for film thicknesses down to 7 nm . This result is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the presence of thin capping layers on polymer films have no measurable effect on the T g(h) dynamics .\nThe experimental data obtained for polymer films supported on substrates indicate that the presence of the free surface tends to decrease T g, whereas the presence of the underlying substrate can tend to increase T g. The T g value measured for a particular polymer\u2013substrate combination will depend on which film interface dominates. To clarify the role of the free surface on the measured T g value, the underlying substrate was removed and freely standing polymer films, with air\u2223polymer interfaces on both sides of the film, were studied . Data points obtained using transmission ellipsometry for freely standing films of narrow distribution PS for different M w values within the range 575 \u00d7 103 < M w < 9100 \u00d7 103 are indicated with symbols in Fig. 2 . The T g values obtained using transmission ellipsometry are the same to within experimental uncertainty as the T g values measured using Brillouin light scattering (BLS) in the original measurements of freely standing PS films . This is particularly significant since the two techniques measure different physical properties of the films: BLS measures the light scattering from the rippling of the film surfaces due to thermally excited, film-guided acoustic phonons and is insensitive to film thickness, whereas the ellipsometry signal is determined by multiple reflections of light from the two film surfaces and yields a measure of the film thickness . Because the BLS signal is determined by the surface ripple, the signal strength does not decrease with decreasing film thickness, unlike all of the other experimental techniques that have been used to probe the glass transition in freely standing polymer films.\nThe most striking feature of the data presented in Fig. 2 is that the T g reductions are much larger for freely standing films than they are for supported films. The data obtained for each M w value has the same qualitative dependence on film thickness h: a constant T g value equal to that in bulk for sufficiently thick films, and a linear reduction in T g with h for h less than a threshold film thickness value h 0. This dependence of T g on h can be interpreted as the interplay between two types of mobility: the bulk mechanism which dominates for sufficiently thick films, and a new mode of mobility which becomes more efficient than the bulk mechanism for sufficiently thin films, resulting in reduced T g values . de Gennes has suggested a mechanism for propagating the mobility of the near-surface segments to depths comparable to the overall size of the polymer molecules, which could give rise to T g reductions over length scales comparable to the overall size of the polymer molecules.\nFor the T g(h) data in Fig. 2, there is also a systematic dependence on M w: an increase in the slope of T g versus h and the threshold film thickness value h 0 with increasing M w. The dependence of the T g(h) data on M w, or equivalently the overall size of the molecules, is unexpected because the glass transition is associated with motion on a much smaller, segmental length scale and also because the T g(h) data obtained for supported polymer films show no measurable dependence on M w . This so-called chain confinement effect, in which deviations from bulk behaviour are dependent on the overall size of the polymer molecules, is unique to high M w freely standing PS films. The freely standing PS film data are even more remarkable if one fits the film thickness dependence of the reduced T g data for each M w value and extrapolates the straight line fits to larger temperature: all six of the straight lines, one for each M w value, intersect at a single point (h*, T g*) . The existence of the intersection point means that, by empirically accounting for the M w-dependence, all of the reduced T g values in Fig. 2 can be replotted as a universal scaling plot, as shown in Fig. 3 . The collapse of all of the data onto a single line is remarkable. However, the physical significance of the intersection point is not yet understood. To determine if the remarkable scaling behaviour shown in Fig. 2 is specific to PS or is more general, measurements have begun on freely standing films of another polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). T g measurements on freely standing films of atactic PMMA (a-PMMA) of a single M w value have been reported . A comparison of the T g(h) data obtained for freely standing PS and a-PMMA films of nearly equivalent M w values is shown in Fig. 4 . The same qualitative dependence of T g on h is observed for both data sets, but the magnitude of the T g reductions at a given film thickness below the threshold film thickness value is substantially less for the a-PMMA films than for the PS films. This indicates that theoretical models which are proposed to explain T g reductions in freely standing polymer films will need to account for polymer-specific properties, e.g. chemical structure or steric hindrance.\nMeasurements performed on films with M w < 350 \u00d7 103 (low M w) have revealed T g reductions with decreasing film thickness that are comparable in absolute terms to those observed with larger M w values, but there is no significant M w-dependence of the T g(h) behaviour for the low M w films (see the solid curve in Fig. 2) . The lack of M w-dependence of the T g reductions observed for the low M w values is reminiscent of the behaviour observed for supported polymer films. In fact, the T g reductions for low M w freely standing polymer films are essentially twice as large as those observed for supported polymer films, suggesting that the magnitude of the T g reduction scales with the number of free surfaces . The low M w freely standing polymer film experimental results have been interpreted in terms of a three layer model in which the layers at the free surfaces are assumed to be more mobile, and the results are consistent with free surface layers which have temperature dependent thicknesses that scale with temperature in the same manner as the cooperativity length scale .\nThere are several intriguing aspects to the T g data obtained for freely standing polymer films. First, the existence of the common intersection point on the plot of T g versus h for films with different, large M w values (see Fig. 2) is striking, but its significance is not yet known. Second, the crossover between a M w-dependence for high M w films, indicative of chain confinement effects, and a lack of M w-dependence for low M w films is not understood. Third, the glass transition observed with both BLS and ellipsometry is very sharp (only several \u00b0C) for all film thicknesses, whereas one would expect that the existence of more mobile surface layers would produce a broadening of the transition for very thin films. All of these aspects of the freely standing polymer film T g results are intriguing and deserve more careful study.\nRecently, T g measurements have been performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of aqueous suspensions of PS spheres with diameters of tens of nanometers . It is reasonable to compare these results with those obtained for freely standing polymer films because the spheres in aqueous suspension in the absence of aggregation are in contact only with water and therefore are essentially unsupported. By placing many spheres in the suspension, while taking care to avoid aggregation, it was possible to obtain a sufficient signal using DSC, a technique that is commonly used to measure T g in bulk samples. In this study, the jump in the specific heat associated with the transition was observed to decrease with decreasing sphere diameter, and these results were interpreted in terms of a central core with bulk dynamics and an outer shell of 4 nm thickness with faster dynamics. The measured T g values were not substantially less than the bulk value, in contrast to the large T g reductions obtained for freely standing PS films. In comparing the results of this study with those obtained for freely standing films, it is important to note two important differences: (1) The PS spheres were produced by microemulsion polymerization in the presence of small quantities of surfactant molecules (to stabilize the spheres in suspension) and therefore have larger polydispersity, different surface character and less chain orientation than for spincoated PS freely standing films; (2) The nature of the confinement is different and this has implications for the equilibration of the samples. Obviously, there is a qualitative difference in the confinement of the polymer molecules: within the spheres, the polymer molecules are confined in three dimensions, instead of the one-dimensional confinement produced in very thin polymer films. The sphere geometry is appealing since it is an equilibrium shape that minimizes the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This allows the spheres to be heated above the bulk T g value without the instabilities that are inherent to thin polymer films (see Section 3.2 below).\nThe first indication of enhanced mobility in thin polymer films was inferred from optical microscopy studies by Reiter of the breakup or dewetting of thin polymer films at temperatures less than the bulk value of T g . These measurements necessarily involve motion of entire polymer molecules due to the formation and growth of holes in the films. Subsequent measurements of whole chain mobility in thin polymer films have focused on diffusion using fluorescently tagged probe and polymer molecules, diffusion at interfaces between two films, and detailed studies of dewetting and hole formation and growth in thin polymer films. Using these techniques, information has been obtained about whole chain motion both parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the film.\nThe first measurements of in-plane chain diffusion were carried out by Frank et al. using fluorescence recovery after patterned photobleaching (FRAPP) using fluorescently labelled PS molecules. They found that the in-plane chain diffusion in thin films was substantially slower for film thicknesses as large as 150 nm compared with that measured for very thick films. In subsequent FRAP measurements of in-plane diffusion of rubrene dye molecules in thin PS films at different temperatures, an increase in mobility was observed with decreasing film thickness, but evidence for probe segregation to the film surfaces was also obtained . Although the average concentration of dye molecules in the films is low (0.6\u20133% by mass), segregation of the dye molecules to the free surface results in much larger concentrations which could artificially enhance the measured diffusion in the near-surface region.\nThere have been considerably more studies of diffusion perpendicular to the plane of the film. Fluorescence nonradiative energy transfer (NRET) measurements of films containing layers of acceptor and donor molecules have been performed to measure diffusion perpendicular to the plane of the film, and these measurements have revealed a decrease in the diffusion coefficient for films less than 150 nm thick . Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) has been used by Rafailovich and coworkers to measure the diffusion perpendicular to the film plane on a variety of different multilayer film geometries incorporating thin layers of deuterated PS (dPS) and layers of hydrogenated PS (hPS) , and for freely standing PS films incorporating short dPS chains as probe molecules . The dynamic SIMS measurements have revealed that the diffusion coefficient is either reduced from the bulk value over substantial distances from the substrate and the free surface , or indistinguishable from that in bulk for freely standing PS films incorporating probe molecules . Neutron reflectometry was used to measure diffusion perpendicular to the film plane for the interface in dPS/hPS bilayer films , and it was found that the diffusion coefficient in thin films was unchanged from that in bulk, except for a slight decrease in the diffusion coefficient with the interface placed near the substrate. Kawaguchi et al. have recently used dynamic SIMS and neutron reflectometry to study the interdiffusion of the interface in hPS/dPS bilayer films. They observed interface broadening at temperatures below Tgbulk, indicating that there was some enhancement of mobility at the interface compared with the bulk. Boiko and Prud\u2019homme have used lap-shear strength measurements on PS/PS interfaces which indicate that there is some interdiffusion at temperatures below Tgbulk .\nHow can we reconcile the measurements of diffusion coefficients in thin polymer films, which in general show either a decrease or no change with respect to the bulk, with the observation of reduced T g, which implies enhanced segmental mobility, in similar films? What about comparisons between the diffusion coefficient results for thin polymer films and those obtained from computer simulations of confined polymer molecules, which show increased diffusion parallel to the film plane and decreased diffusion perpendicular to the film plane (see )? To make meaningful comparisons, it is important to measure the temperature dependence of the mobility at different length scales. In particular, it is important to ask whether or not time-temperature superposition holds for the two types of motion, i.e. can the temperature dependence of the mobility at the different length scales be described by Eq. 2 using the same values of T A and T 0, as it does (to a reasonable approximation) in bulk. Comparisons made at a single temperature could give differences that are due to a thickness dependence of the prefactor A in Eq. 2 instead of a difference in the temperature-dependent factor . To properly compare the mobility at different length scales, it is important to measure the temperature dependence and to compare the values of T 0. Despite the importance of measuring the temperature dependence of the diffusion in thin polymer films, only very few studies to date have provided this information. Clearly, more effort in this area is required to make a proper evaluation of the dynamics at different length scales.\nWhole chain motion in thin polymer films can also be probed by exploiting instabilities that are inherent to thin films. Thin polymer films can be susceptible to the formation of holes when heated to temperatures that are comparable to or greater than the bulk glass transition temperature Tgbulk. Obviously, if holes form and grow in the films, entire polymer molecules must move. This motion occurs initially perpendicular to the film plane, for the hole to form across the entire film thickness, and then is predominantly in the plane of the film, as the hole grows. In the absence of external fields, the instability can be driven by the van der Waals or dispersion interaction which can be substantial for film thicknesses h < 100 nm . For films supported on substrates, it is possible for the dispersion interaction between the two film surfaces to be attractive such that the film of uniform thickness breaks up into droplets via a process known as dewetting , or repulsive, which enhances the stability of the films . Unsupported or freely standing polymer films are always unstable to the formation and growth of holes at elevated temperatures , since the dispersion interaction is always attractive for this film geometry which is symmetric about the midplane of the film . Holes can form via two different mechanisms: they can be nucleated by external perturbations or defects, such as dust or density inhomogeneities; or they can form spontaneously due to amplification of long-wavelength fluctuations of the film surfaces by the attractive dispersion or van der Waals interaction between the two film surfaces. In the case of nucleation, holes with radii R greater than a critical value R c grow with time, where R c = h/2 . In the case of spontaneous hole formation, holes can form in the film due to the interplay between the dispersion and surface tension contributions to the free energy .\nThe stresses due to the dispersion interaction and surface tension which drive hole formation and growth are large in very thin films. Therefore, the whole chain motion in hole formation and growth experiments can be considerably more complicated than that observed in chain diffusion experiments due to the presence of large stresses and the importance of nonlinear viscoelastic effects. Recent studies of the dewetting of supported PS films using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) at temperatures close to Tgbulk have suggested that hole growth may occur, not by polymer flow, but rather by yielding or plastic deformation of the polymer due to the very large stresses that are produced by the interactions that drive the hole growth . The importance of nonlinear viscoelastic effects in interpreting these experimental results has also been considered .\nMeasurements of hole formation and growth in freely standing polymer films are particularly interesting because of the very large reductions in T g, indicative of enhanced segmental motion, that have been observed for these films . Hole formation and growth in freely standing films was first measured using optical microscopy , in which the growth of a single hole was tracked in time. The hole radius was observed to grow exponentially with time: R(t) = R0et/\u03c4, where \u03c4 is the characteristic growth time. For freely standing PS films , it was found that \u03c4 decreased with decreasing film thickness h. This result was interpreted in terms of the bulk phenomenon of shear thinning in which the film viscosity at the edge of the hole, \u03b7 = \u03c4\u03f5/h, where \u03f5 is the surface tension, decreased with increasing shear strain rate \u03b3\u02d9=2/\u03c4, according to a power law dependence \u03b7\u223c\u2223\u03b3\u02d9\u2223-d with d = 0.65 \u00b1 0.03. We have recently developed a differential pressure experiment (DPE) to measure the growth of holes in freely standing PS films at temperatures above and below Tgbulk for thicknesses that are sufficiently small such that the measured T g values as measured using ellipsometry are reduced from the bulk value . A very small pressure difference (less than 10\u22124 atm) is applied across a freely standing polymer film, and the position of a piston is controlled to maintain a constant pressure difference across the film. When the film is heated, holes form and grow and the piston must move in one direction to maintain the constant pressure difference. The time dependence of the piston position provides a signature for hole formation and growth and it can be analysed to obtain the characteristic growth time \u03c4 . The pressure difference applied across the film does not influence the formation or growth of the holes; it is chosen to be as small as possible while still allowing the detection of the holes.\nThe characteristic growth times \u03c4 measured at different temperatures using the DPE for freely standing PS films with M w = 2240 \u00d7 103 and three different thicknesses are shown in Fig. 5 . The T g values of the freely standing PS films were 97 (bulk value), 66 and 25 \u00b0C for films with h = 91, 68 and 51 nm, respectively . Unfortunately, \u03c4 can be obtained only for a limited range of temperatures, since measurements of the characteristic growth time \u03c4 are limited by the rapid growth of holes at temperatures T>Tgbulk. The small shifts in temperature between the different data sets shown in Fig. 5 can be explained in terms of the bulk phenomenon of shear thinning . The main result of this study is that substantial hole growth occurs only for temperatures that are comparable to Tgbulk, which for very thin films can be considerably higher than the reduced T g values. Thus, the DPE results indicate that despite considerable mobility present on a segmental length scale in these films, hole growth and corresponding whole chain motion does not occur until temperatures close to the bulk value of T g are reached.\nWe have described considerable experimental evidence that shows that segmental mobility can be enhanced in very thin polymer films while the motion of entire chains is unchanged from that in bulk. In particular, the results obtained for freely standing polymer films are unique and remarkable, with very large reductions in the glass transition temperature and no corresponding enhancement of whole chain motion for very thin films. Several ideas have been proposed to resolve this apparent contradiction : a variation in mobility across the thickness of the films, differences in the polymer mobility parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the films, and decoupling of segmental and chain motions in thin polymer films. The current situation is that there are several possible explanations, but no definitive resolution, for this issue, and it highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the mobility being probed in a given experiment so that meaningful comparisons of different experimental studies can be made. Another key issue centres on the length scale over which changes in mobility can be observed, and the fluorescently tagged multilayer films studied in hold much promise to elucidate more completely the detailed T g behaviour near free polymer surfaces and within thin polymer films. The nonequilibrium nature of thin polymer films, which are produced by spincoating techniques and cannot be fully annealed at temperatures greater than T g due to the inherent instability discussed in Section 3, is a potential concern since spincoating can produce radial alignment and reduced entanglement of the polymer chains with corresponding anisotropy in the physical properties. However, recent studies have shown that possible reductions in entanglement density in spincoated polymer films are not responsible for T g reductions in thin polymer films .\nThe development of new experimental techniques to study the dynamics of polymers at free surfaces provides the promise of new insights, but additional effort is required to develop the proper analysis of the data, especially those involving mechanical deformation of polymers at elevated temperatures, so that the results obtained using different techniques can be meaningfully compared. In addition, computer simulations and theoretical models have been developed to learn in detail about the structure and dynamics of confined glassy liquids. A recent discussion of the free surface experiments, the computer simulations and the theoretical models is given in .\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in understanding the effect of the film interfaces and free surfaces on the glass transition and whole chain motion. The use of new and improved experimental techniques and sophisticated sample geometries, combined with advances in theoretical analyses and computer simulations, will ensure that the study of dynamics in thin polymer films remains a rich area of research, leading to a deeper understanding of mobility of confined polymer molecules on different length scales."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nLipids are a structurally diverse group of molecules and that diversity is necessary for the broad range of roles that they play in cellular processes. These diverse functions include maintaining an electrochemical gradient, subcellular partitioning, cell signaling, energy storage, and protein trafficking and membrane anchoring . The most widely recognized role of lipids is to form the lipid bilayer of cellular and organelle membranes. Although the membranes are made up mostly of glycerol-based phospholipids, a variety of other lipids are present in order to provide the adaptability and flexibility necessary for cell membranes . The membrane also supports a variety of proteins that are involved in many cellular processes; as many as 20\u201330% of all proteins are integral membrane proteins, and many more function near a cellular or organelle membrane . The properties of the membranes and therefore the lipids have a direct effect on many cellular processes; lipids do much more than simply providing a flexible, permeable cell barrier. Each membrane also has many subdomains such as lipid rafts, lipid domains, and organizations of membrane associated complexes . Lipids can also affect proteins by holding protein complexes together, providing the interface between proteins subunits, providing the hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic solvent where proteins can fold, and directing proteins to their locations of action . The diverse and sometimes multiple roles lipids play within a cell can make determining lipid function difficult, but determining the function is important for understanding cellular processes. Understanding what role lipids play in normal cells can lead to an understanding of how lipids function in a disease state . Even empirical information on differences in lipid composition between healthy and diseased tissue can be valuable. It has already been reported that alterations in the phospholipid composition of tissue are seen in certain diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease . Lipids have also been found to play a role in the underlying biological processes of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis . Malignant transformations in some tissues have been characterized by an abundance of certain phospholipids and their enzymatic by-products . Findings such as these emphasize the importance of determining the compositions of phospholipids in biological tissues, because they may have prognostic value for determining disease.\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an increasingly powerful analytical tool in the field of lipidomics, allowing for the identification, characterization, and quantitation of various lipid species. A variety of ionization techniques have been used to study the various classes of lipids, including chemical ionization (CI) , fast atom bombardment (FAB) , electrospray ionization (ESI) , secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) , and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) . Techniques such as atmospheric pressure CI and ESI require that the sample be in an aqueous solution, which requires extensive sample preparation when the sample is in the form of a tissue section or a cell culture. MALDI and SIMS allow for more direct analysis of tissue samples, but MALDI requires the application of a matrix to the sample and with both techniques the samples are typically examined after introduction into the high vacuum region of the mass spectrometer. With the sample under vacuum, ready chemical or physical manipulation is difficult. Some of the disadvantages of these methods are overcome with the ambient ionization technique of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) although in other respects it too has limitations as discussed herein.\nDESI is an ambient ionization technique that allows for the direct analysis of biological samples, such as tissue. DESI offers the advantages of little or no sample preparation; it does not require the addition of a matrix and it is conducted outside the mass spectrometer at atmospheric pressure . In DESI, a pneumatically assisted electrospray produces charged droplets that are directed at a surface, see schematic in Fig. 1 . As the charged droplets collide with the sample surface they wet it and analytes are extracted into the liquid film; impact of subsequent primary droplets releases secondary microdroplets giving rise to the term, droplet pick-up . Following this analyte pick-up mechanism, the standard electrospray solvent evaporation processes occur, followed finally by the production of dry ions of analyte in the interface either by the field desportion (FDM) or charge residue process (CRM) . DESI has been used for many different applications, including, forensics , imaging , metabolomics , pharmaceutics , the characterization of natural products , bacteria , polymers , proteins , and explosives detection .\nDESI-MS has been successfully used to ionize and detect lipids and has been evaluated systematically for the characterization of phospholipids . Among the parameters investigated were the effects of surface and solvents, and experiments were conducted in the full scan mode in addition to the fragmentation patterns being studied by collision induced dissociation . These studies focused on phospholipids because these particular classes of lipids were observed in past DESI experiments conducted on tissue . Lipid standard solutions were dissolved in chloroform or a mixture of chloroform and methanol and spotted onto various surfaces such as glass, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), flat polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), PTFE printed glass, and subsequently analyzed by DESI-MS . These studies allowed the determination of the best surface, PTFE printed glass, and the optimal spray solvent, a 1:1 methanol/water (vol:vol) for lipid analysis . Experiments conducted on the lipid standards in the full scan mode and in the MS/MS mode showed that DESI-MS could be used to correctly characterize those lipid species .\nIn order to establish the ability of DESI-MS to analyze the lipids present in complex biological matrices such as tissue samples, total lipid extract from porcine brain was subjected to analysis in both positive and negative ion mode and an example mass spectrum collected in the negative ion mode is shown in Fig. 2 . Phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols and sulfatides dominate the spectrum in the negative mode. In order to positively identify particular ions present in the mass spectrum, tandem mass spectrometry can be used, as was done with the lipid standards. Fig. 2 shows the MS/MS spectrum recorded for the sulfatide sphingolipid at m/z 888 . The fragmentation pattern shown is sufficient to identify m/z 888 as a sulfatide with a 24:1 nonhydroxylated fatty acid chain. This same experiment can be conducted for any peak present in the lipid profile. In the positive mode the primary species present are phosphatidylcholines, and as was demonstrated in negative ion mode, tandem mass spectrometry can be used to identify particular ions . The same methodology used for the brain extract can be applied to direct tissue analysis of thin rat brain tissue sections .\nImaging MS (IMS) is a powerful resource in the biological sciences. Using IMS an image can be created from the individual mass spectra collected for a sample showing the distribution of particular compounds over the sample area. In this way the chemical information obtained from the mass spectra is combined with the spatial information from the imaging experiments. This ability to record spatial and molecular information simultaneously on surfaces is a particularly powerful approach, especially with DESI-MS which requires limited preparation and the sample is under ambient conditions.\nIn typical DESI imaging experiments, the collected tissue sample is flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C and is subsequently cut in micron thin sections using a cryostat-microtome and the thin tissue slices are thaw mounted onto glass microscope slides for analysis, see Fig. 3 for a schematic. As in other MS experiments, in IMS ions are transported from surfaces, including tissue samples, to the gas-phase for mass analysis as the surface is being moved in order to cover the entire sample area. A mass spectrum is generated for each pixel on the surface, and ion images of the area sampled are constructed to show the spatial distribution of the intensity of selected ion, see Fig. 3. In this manner, a chemical image of a particular compound or a particular lipid present in the tissue section can be constructed. So the distribution of a particular lipid can be visualized and differences noted between different tissue samples, such as in tumor and normal tissue. IMS is becoming a powerful technique for analyzing histological sections of biological tissue , because it has the potential to provide more information and to provide it much faster than traditional methods.\nIn the field of IMS, both MALDI and SIMS have been used extensively. MALDI IMS can achieve resolution of \u226525 \u03bcm although 100 \u03bcm is routinely achieved, but experiments are for the most part conducted in the high vacuum region of the instrument . Atmospheric pressure MALDI (AP-MALDI) has been introduced to allow ionization to occur at atmospheric pressure with comparable performance to conventional MALDI . AP-MALDI facilitates the coupling of the source to alternative mass analyzers such as the linear ion trap and the Fourier transform mass spectrometer, expanding the applications of the technique . AP-MALDI has been used to analyze peptides, proteins, oligosaccharides, small molecules, and tryptic digests and has the potential to expand into IMS . Both conventional MALDI and AP-MALDI require sample preparation steps including the application of an organic matrix to the sample for ionization. These sample preparation steps can influence the spatial integrity of the analytes as well as influence the degradation of the analytes prior to analysis . The choice of the matrix is key for signal quality and intensity and must be targeted to the analytes of interest, the matrix must also be applied uniformly for optimal signal intensity over the entire sample and also for maintaining the spatial integrity . Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) has been recently used for two-dimensional imaging as well as depth profiling, with the potential for in vivo applications . Electrospray assisted laser desorption ionization (ELDI) has also been shown to have the potential for direct tissue analysis in the ambient environment . Imaging using SIMS potentially provides the advantage of very high spatial resolution of approximately 100 nm and can be performed without additional sample preparation, but SIMS imaging also cannot be conducted under ambient conditions and in addition, SIMS is a harsher ionization technique that tends to produce more dissociation than DESI or MALDI. In traditional atomic ion source SIMS it was difficult to desorb ions with m/z >500, making it impossible to detect large biomolecules . Now with the availability of cluster ion sources, such as Aun +, Bn x+, SF5 +, and C60 x+, secondary ion yields are increased allowing the detection of larger molecules . SIMS also allows for molecular depth profiling using cluster ion sources therefore permitting 3D imaging . DESI is a soft ionization method, providing intact ionized molecules . DESI has a spatial resolution of only 250 \u03bcm , although recent experiments have optimized condition and achieved a resolution of 40 \u03bcm .\nMany lipid species are easily ionized by DESI, making them attractive target molecules from which to create molecular images of thin tissue sections. To this end, DESI-MS has previously been used to construct chemical images of tissue sections . The first experiments applying DESI-MS to biological tissue profiling were conducted on thin tissue sections of mouse pancreas, rat brain, and metastatic human liver adenocarcinoma, as well as whole tissue analysis of adipose tissue surrounding a chicken heart . Interrogation of the mouse pancreas tissue gave strong signals from the major lipid components of biological membranes, the phosphatidylcholine species . DESI-MS analysis of rat brain tissue resulted in phospholipid signals mainly from saturated fatty acids . Since lipid distributions change with disease states, such as cancer, the lipid profiles were expected to differ between the cancerous and adjacent normal tissue of the human liver adenocarcinoma, and this was found to be true, as shown in Fig. 4 . Dominant signals from palmitic acid containing phospholipids were present in the non-cancerous tissue, with unsaturated fatty acids containing phospholipids making up the transition area of the tissue, and sphingomyelin was elevated in the tumor tissue . As an early proof of concept, intact adipose tissue in situ surrounding a chicken heart was analyzed by DESI-MS, resulting in signals from the free fatty acids present on the tissue surface . Further imaging experiments were conducted using rat brain tissue sections in order to create the first two-dimensional DESI ion images . The ion images constructed from the distributions of the phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sulfatide (ST), in the negative ion mode are shown in Fig. 5 ; structural confirmation comes from tandem mass spectrometry information. An optical image of the rat brain section is also shown and it is evident that the structural features of the brain are also seen using imaging DESI-MS . The results for the ion intensities of the lipid species seen in the rat brain are in good agreement with reported literature information of the composition and distribution of lipids in the brain tissue .\nPreliminary data from a small set of breast tissue sample shows the potential of DESI tissue imaging to distinguish between normal or benign, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (DC) specimens. The distribution of two lipid ions, ionized in the negative mode, at m/z 863 and m/z 818, were seen in benign breast tissue, DCIS, and DC. The intensities of the two ions are vastly different between the tissue samples and are tentatively identified as a phosphatidylinositol and a phosphotidylserine. Neither lipid species is present in the benign breast tissue at levels greater than the spectral noise, but both species are present in the DC tissue samples. In contrast the DCIS sample displays significant signal for the molecule at m/z 863, but virtually no signal for the molecule at m/z 818. These results show promise for the use of DESI IMS to distinguish between not only cancerous and non-cancerous tissue, but also to identify the specific type and stage of the cancer. Other lipid ions, at m/z 887 and m/z 885 also show differences between benign tissue and invasive ductal carcinoma as seen in Fig. 6 . Normal tissue shows high signal intensity for m/z 885, but no signal for m/z 887, where in contrast DC tissue shows high signal intensity for m/z 887 and virtually no signal at m/z 885. The instrument and associated parameters used for this experiment are described previously, with additional parameters of a volumetric flow rate of 1.5 \u03bcL min\u22121, a spray solvent of acetonitrile/water (40:60, v/v), the tissue cut to a thickness of 12 \u03bcm, a stage velocity of 180 \u03bcm min\u22121 during data acquisition, and a spatial resolution of 200 \u03bcm . Further work mapping more ion signals in both positive and negative mode are anticipated to allow for increased specificity of disease diagnosis.\nThe data collection process for DESI IMS is completely automated using XCalibur 2.0 software from Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA, an in-house program allows the conversion of these raw files into a format acceptable for use in the BioMap (freeware, www.msi.maldi.org) software. BioMap is an image analysis software platform allowing for the generation of the spatial intensity distributions of selected ions as seen in the images presented in this paper. With an assembled library of compounds denoting benign versus cancerous tissue the bioinformatics of the process could also be automated. This would provide healthcare workers with an automated, reliable process for diagnosis.\nA wide range of tissue types, as evidenced by the experiments conducted on rat brain , human liver adenocarcinoma , and human breast cancer tissue have been successfully imaged by DESI-MS. Preliminary studies have shown that DESI can be used to successfully image canine tumor tissue. Fig. 7 shows the optical image as well as the molecular images of a canine abdominal tumor. The instrument and associated parameters used for this experiment are as described previously, with additional parameters of a volumetric flow rate of 1.5 \u03bcL min\u22121, a spray solvent of acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v), the tissue cut to a thickness of 15 \u03bcm, a stage velocity of 229 \u03bcm min\u22121 during data acquisition, and a spatial resolution of 250 \u03bcm . The compounds present in the mass spectra have not yet been positively identified, but can be described as phospholipids species.\nThe ability of DESI-MS to successfully image lipid species in thin tissue sections with little sample preparation is proving to be a potentially useful approach in the biological sciences. The diagnostic value of the lipids in many different disease states opens up the possibility for many applications of this technology and for this approach to have an impact in a clinical as well as a research setting. With these experiments serving as a foundation for future experiments under ambient conditions both in vitro and in vivo, it paves the way for a real time surgical tool to detect changes in lipid composition and distribution providing diagnostic value.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Lipids are a structurally diverse group of molecules and that diversity is necessary for the broad range of roles that they play in cellular processes. These diverse functions include maintaining an electrochemical gradient, subcellular partitioning, cell signaling, energy storage, and protein trafficking and membrane anchoring . The most widely recognized role of lipids is to form the lipid bilayer of cellular and organelle membranes. Although the membranes are made up mostly of glycerol-based phospholipids, a variety of other lipids are present in order to provide the adaptability and flexibility necessary for cell membranes . The membrane also supports a variety of proteins that are involved in many cellular processes; as many as 20\u201330% of all proteins are integral membrane proteins, and many more function near a cellular or organelle membrane . The properties of the membranes and therefore the lipids have a direct effect on many cellular processes; lipids do much more than simply providing a flexible, permeable cell barrier. Each membrane also has many subdomains such as lipid rafts, lipid domains, and organizations of membrane associated complexes . Lipids can also affect proteins by holding protein complexes together, providing the interface between proteins subunits, providing the hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic solvent where proteins can fold, and directing proteins to their locations of action . The diverse and sometimes multiple roles lipids play within a cell can make determining lipid function difficult, but determining the function is important for understanding cellular processes. Understanding what role lipids play in normal cells can lead to an understanding of how lipids function in a disease state . Even empirical information on differences in lipid composition between healthy and diseased tissue can be valuable. It has already been reported that alterations in the phospholipid composition of tissue are seen in certain diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease . Lipids have also been found to play a role in the underlying biological processes of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis . Malignant transformations in some tissues have been characterized by an abundance of certain phospholipids and their enzymatic by-products . Findings such as these emphasize the importance of determining the compositions of phospholipids in biological tissues, because they may have prognostic value for determining disease.\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an increasingly powerful analytical tool in the field of lipidomics, allowing for the identification, characterization, and quantitation of various lipid species. A variety of ionization techniques have been used to study the various classes of lipids, including chemical ionization (CI) , fast atom bombardment (FAB) , electrospray ionization (ESI) , secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) , and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) . Techniques such as atmospheric pressure CI and ESI require that the sample be in an aqueous solution, which requires extensive sample preparation when the sample is in the form of a tissue section or a cell culture. MALDI and SIMS allow for more direct analysis of tissue samples, but MALDI requires the application of a matrix to the sample and with both techniques the samples are typically examined after introduction into the high vacuum region of the mass spectrometer. With the sample under vacuum, ready chemical or physical manipulation is difficult.

These studies allowed the determination of the best surface, PTFE printed glass, and the optimal spray solvent, a 1:1 methanol/water (vol:vol) for lipid analysis . Experiments conducted on the lipid standards in the full scan mode and in the MS/MS mode showed that DESI-MS could be used to correctly characterize those lipid species .\nIn order to establish the ability of DESI-MS to analyze the lipids present in complex biological matrices such as tissue samples, total lipid extract from porcine brain was subjected to analysis in both positive and negative ion mode and an example mass spectrum collected in the negative ion mode is shown in Fig. 2 . Phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols and sulfatides dominate the spectrum in the negative mode. In order to positively identify particular ions present in the mass spectrum, tandem mass spectrometry can be used, as was done with the lipid standards. Fig. 2 shows the MS/MS spectrum recorded for the sulfatide sphingolipid at m/z 888 . The fragmentation pattern shown is sufficient to identify m/z 888 as a sulfatide with a 24:1 nonhydroxylated fatty acid chain. This same experiment can be conducted for any peak present in the lipid profile. In the positive mode the primary species present are phosphatidylcholines, and as was demonstrated in negative ion mode, tandem mass spectrometry can be used to identify particular ions . The same methodology used for the brain extract can be applied to direct tissue analysis of thin rat brain tissue sections .\nImaging MS (IMS) is a powerful resource in the biological sciences. Using IMS an image can be created from the individual mass spectra collected for a sample showing the distribution of particular compounds over the sample area. In this way the chemical information obtained from the mass spectra is combined with the spatial information from the imaging experiments. This ability to record spatial and molecular information simultaneously on surfaces is a particularly powerful approach, especially with DESI-MS which requires limited preparation and the sample is under ambient conditions.\nIn typical DESI imaging experiments, the collected tissue sample is flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C and is subsequently cut in micron thin sections using a cryostat-microtome and the thin tissue slices are thaw mounted onto glass microscope slides for analysis, see Fig. 3 for a schematic. As in other MS experiments, in IMS ions are transported from surfaces, including tissue samples, to the gas-phase for mass analysis as the surface is being moved in order to cover the entire sample area. A mass spectrum is generated for each pixel on the surface, and ion images of the area sampled are constructed to show the spatial distribution of the intensity of selected ion, see Fig. 3. In this manner, a chemical image of a particular compound or a particular lipid present in the tissue section can be constructed. So the distribution of a particular lipid can be visualized and differences noted between different tissue samples, such as in tumor and normal tissue. IMS is becoming a powerful technique for analyzing histological sections of biological tissue , because it has the potential to provide more information and to provide it much faster than traditional methods.\nIn the field of IMS, both MALDI and SIMS have been used extensively. MALDI IMS can achieve resolution of \u226525 \u03bcm although 100 \u03bcm is routinely achieved, but experiments are for the most part conducted in the high vacuum region of the instrument . Atmospheric pressure MALDI (AP-MALDI) has been introduced to allow ionization to occur at atmospheric pressure with comparable performance to conventional MALDI . AP-MALDI facilitates the coupling of the source to alternative mass analyzers such as the linear ion trap and the Fourier transform mass spectrometer, expanding the applications of the technique . AP-MALDI has been used to analyze peptides, proteins, oligosaccharides, small molecules, and tryptic digests and has the potential to expand into IMS . Both conventional MALDI and AP-MALDI require sample preparation steps including the application of an organic matrix to the sample for ionization. These sample preparation steps can influence the spatial integrity of the analytes as well as influence the degradation of the analytes prior to analysis . The choice of the matrix is key for signal quality and intensity and must be targeted to the analytes of interest, the matrix must also be applied uniformly for optimal signal intensity over the entire sample and also for maintaining the spatial integrity . Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) has been recently used for two-dimensional imaging as well as depth profiling, with the potential for in vivo applications . Electrospray assisted laser desorption ionization (ELDI) has also been shown to have the potential for direct tissue analysis in the ambient environment . Imaging using SIMS potentially provides the advantage of very high spatial resolution of approximately 100 nm and can be performed without additional sample preparation, but SIMS imaging also cannot be conducted under ambient conditions and in addition, SIMS is a harsher ionization technique that tends to produce more dissociation than DESI or MALDI. In traditional atomic ion source SIMS it was difficult to desorb ions with m/z >500, making it impossible to detect large biomolecules . Now with the availability of cluster ion sources, such as Aun +, Bn x+, SF5 +, and C60 x+, secondary ion yields are increased allowing the detection of larger molecules . SIMS also allows for molecular depth profiling using cluster ion sources therefore permitting 3D imaging . DESI is a soft ionization method, providing intact ionized molecules . DESI has a spatial resolution of only 250 \u03bcm , although recent experiments have optimized condition and achieved a resolution of 40 \u03bcm .\nMany lipid species are easily ionized by DESI, making them attractive target molecules from which to create molecular images of thin tissue sections. To this end, DESI-MS has previously been used to construct chemical images of tissue sections . The first experiments applying DESI-MS to biological tissue profiling were conducted on thin tissue sections of mouse pancreas, rat brain, and metastatic human liver adenocarcinoma, as well as whole tissue analysis of adipose tissue surrounding a chicken heart . Interrogation of the mouse pancreas tissue gave strong signals from the major lipid components of biological membranes, the phosphatidylcholine species . DESI-MS analysis of rat brain tissue resulted in phospholipid signals mainly from saturated fatty acids . Since lipid distributions change with disease states, such as cancer, the lipid profiles were expected to differ between the cancerous and adjacent normal tissue of the human liver adenocarcinoma, and this was found to be true, as shown in Fig. 4 . Dominant signals from palmitic acid containing phospholipids were present in the non-cancerous tissue, with unsaturated fatty acids containing phospholipids making up the transition area of the tissue, and sphingomyelin was elevated in the tumor tissue . As an early proof of concept, intact adipose tissue in situ surrounding a chicken heart was analyzed by DESI-MS, resulting in signals from the free fatty acids present on the tissue surface . Further imaging experiments were conducted using rat brain tissue sections in order to create the first two-dimensional DESI ion images . The ion images constructed from the distributions of the phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sulfatide (ST), in the negative ion mode are shown in Fig. 5 ; structural confirmation comes from tandem mass spectrometry information. An optical image of the rat brain section is also shown and it is evident that the structural features of the brain are also seen using imaging DESI-MS . The results for the ion intensities of the lipid species seen in the rat brain are in good agreement with reported literature information of the composition and distribution of lipids in the brain tissue .\nPreliminary data from a small set of breast tissue sample shows the potential of DESI tissue imaging to distinguish between normal or benign, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (DC) specimens. The distribution of two lipid ions, ionized in the negative mode, at m/z 863 and m/z 818, were seen in benign breast tissue, DCIS, and DC. The intensities of the two ions are vastly different between the tissue samples and are tentatively identified as a phosphatidylinositol and a phosphotidylserine. Neither lipid species is present in the benign breast tissue at levels greater than the spectral noise, but both species are present in the DC tissue samples. In contrast the DCIS sample displays significant signal for the molecule at m/z 863, but virtually no signal for the molecule at m/z 818. These results show promise for the use of DESI IMS to distinguish between not only cancerous and non-cancerous tissue, but also to identify the specific type and stage of the cancer. Other lipid ions, at m/z 887 and m/z 885 also show differences between benign tissue and invasive ductal carcinoma as seen in Fig. 6 . Normal tissue shows high signal intensity for m/z 885, but no signal for m/z 887, where in contrast DC tissue shows high signal intensity for m/z 887 and virtually no signal at m/z 885. The instrument and associated parameters used for this experiment are described previously, with additional parameters of a volumetric flow rate of 1.5 \u03bcL min\u22121, a spray solvent of acetonitrile/water (40:60, v/v), the tissue cut to a thickness of 12 \u03bcm, a stage velocity of 180 \u03bcm min\u22121 during data acquisition, and a spatial resolution of 200 \u03bcm . Further work mapping more ion signals in both positive and negative mode are anticipated to allow for increased specificity of disease diagnosis.\nThe data collection process for DESI IMS is completely automated using XCalibur 2.0 software from Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA, an in-house program allows the conversion of these raw files into a format acceptable for use in the BioMap (freeware, www.msi.maldi.org) software. BioMap is an image analysis software platform allowing for the generation of the spatial intensity distributions of selected ions as seen in the images presented in this paper. With an assembled library of compounds denoting benign versus cancerous tissue the bioinformatics of the process could also be automated. This would provide healthcare workers with an automated, reliable process for diagnosis.\nA wide range of tissue types, as evidenced by the experiments conducted on rat brain , human liver adenocarcinoma , and human breast cancer tissue have been successfully imaged by DESI-MS. Preliminary studies have shown that DESI can be used to successfully image canine tumor tissue. Fig. 7 shows the optical image as well as the molecular images of a canine abdominal tumor. The instrument and associated parameters used for this experiment are as described previously, with additional parameters of a volumetric flow rate of 1.5 \u03bcL min\u22121, a spray solvent of acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v), the tissue cut to a thickness of 15 \u03bcm, a stage velocity of 229 \u03bcm min\u22121 during data acquisition, and a spatial resolution of 250 \u03bcm . The compounds present in the mass spectra have not yet been positively identified, but can be described as phospholipids species.\nThe ability of DESI-MS to successfully image lipid species in thin tissue sections with little sample preparation is proving to be a potentially useful approach in the biological sciences. The diagnostic value of the lipids in many different disease states opens up the possibility for many applications of this technology and for this approach to have an impact in a clinical as well as a research setting. With these experiments serving as a foundation for future experiments under ambient conditions both in vitro and in vivo, it paves the way for a real time surgical tool to detect changes in lipid composition and distribution providing diagnostic value."
